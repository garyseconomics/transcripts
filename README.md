## Code of Conduct

Please be extra vigilant of spammers, scammers, and fake accounts, with usernames such as `garyeconomics` or `.garyseconomics` claiming to be one of the admins or Gary himself.
If you have any further queries, or should you be contacted by any accounts like this, please notify a staff member using the official contact form at [wealtheconomics.org/contact](https://www.wealtheconomics.org/contact)

This is a community space for educating each other about real-world economics.
People are coming from different backgrounds, with different experiences and different levels of knowledge.
If you think someone is wrong about something, be respectful and assume good faith until proven otherwise.

Stay on topic in issues and pull requests.
It's natural to drift onto other subjects sometimes, but don't keep bringing up your own personal obsession or try to divert the subject to something else.

If you want to chat more generally, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vqME6WsPd7).

Don't make personal attacks on people and be constructive with criticism.
If you want to disagree with someone's opinion, do it without insulting them.

Get consent before posting personal information about someone.

If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know.
We want this to be a welcoming space.

Do not post hate speech, racial or sexual slurs, or pornographic content.
This includes depictions in videos, gifs and images.

No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc.) without permission from a staff member.

This is NOT a place for discussing investments, including crypto and stock trading.
There are many other places for that.
This is not one of them.

These rules are not exclusive, but should give you an idea of where we're coming from.
Moderators may use their own judgement to moderate.
