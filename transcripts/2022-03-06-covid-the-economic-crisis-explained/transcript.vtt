00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.520
okay so what i want to do today is basically&nbsp;
a recap and a very clear explanation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.920
situation that we are in economically um at the&nbsp;
moment largely with regards to Covid we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.480
to touch obviously on the Russia-Ukraine&nbsp;
situation a little bit but um largely it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.840
be a recap of the economic situation right now&nbsp;
because we're about 2 years in to Covid now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.120
and we're starting to see the transition which&nbsp;
i've been expecting for a while where this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.360
ceases to be primarily a health crisis and we move&nbsp;
into basically a really acute economic crisis um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.840
people who've been following this&nbsp;
channel especially from the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.560
will be aware that i've been saying&nbsp;
from the very beginning of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.600
that the way we are dealing with it is&nbsp;
going to create massive economic problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.840
a little bit down the line. now we're seeing&nbsp;
those economic problems coming through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.600
but they are being phenomenally terribly&nbsp;
understood and explained by the mainstream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.560
media so what this means is massive economic&nbsp;
hits are coming in right now to ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.600
basically what has been called the cost of living&nbsp;
crisis and it's actually very easy to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.560
how this is happening and it's been predicted&nbsp;
in early videos on this channel but it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.440
being explained it's not being understood and the&nbsp;
way that the government has handled the economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.600
crisis has actually made it very difficult for&nbsp;
ordinary people to understand what's going on so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.360
what i want to do is basically peel the lid back&nbsp;
on this and explain really clearly what's going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.000
so it's about a year and a half&nbsp;
now since we started this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360
and at the very beginning of code we put our first&nbsp;
video out well it was about was it July when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.040
first video went out? something like that, um and&nbsp;
what that video was about was explaining how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.280
the way that Covid has been handled by central&nbsp;
banks (i.e. Bank of England) and governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.800
led to and would lead to an enormous&nbsp;
increase of cash in the bank accounts of rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.880
people specifically it's so important that people&nbsp;
understand that so if anybody hasn't watched that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
first video on the channel i would recommend&nbsp;
to go and watch it and understand that because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.840
if you want to understand what's happening with&nbsp;
the economy now and what's going to happen in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.560
the next couple of years the number one thing&nbsp;
you need to understand is that big thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.760
has changed economically now versus pre Covid 
is rich and very rich people in this country and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.720
other similar countries in Europe, USA, Australia 
all&nbsp;over the world - rich people have way way way &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.760
way more cash than they had before Covid&nbsp;
No.1 biggest change and the scale of that cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.560
be underestimated you know i've i keep talking&nbsp;
about it but it's ten thousand pounds per adult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.440
was the amount of money printed in this country&nbsp;
but it's all gone to the richest sort of ten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.680
twenty percent so each one of those people has&nbsp;
we're talking about each adult so if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.160
a family with two adults both of them each one of&nbsp;
them has 70-80000 pounds extra cash in their bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.960
than pre-covid and the reason why i think this&nbsp;
is really important to emphasize is because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.680
know most people are not rich or super rich right&nbsp;
so say you're an ordinary person right most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.640
people watching this video are ordinary people&nbsp;
they have not accumulated 70 grand during Covid

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.440
they don't know that the rich people accumulated&nbsp;
Â£70,000 during Covid right they don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.480
there's no way of them knowing so it's very&nbsp;
important that they are aware of this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.800
everything that happens now and will happen&nbsp;
in the next sort of 10-15 years economically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.840
will be determined by the fact dominated by the&nbsp;
fact that these rich people have accumulated a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.600
huge amount of money during coving so the&nbsp;
number one thing which everybody needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.280
know and i know i'll keep going on about this&nbsp;
but the reason i'm doing this is because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.680
media are not talking about it and it's a it's&nbsp;
a clean fact right is that the rich people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.120
this country are sitting on 70-80 grand each cash&nbsp;
more and i want people to just stop and think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.880
of how much money there is 70 80 grand sitting in&nbsp;
their account that wasn't there before coving okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.080
that's there now and um if you want to understand&nbsp;
how it's explained very clearly first video on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.160
this channel I think it's called "how covid-19 
is making the rich richer" that's right right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.680
um understand that please understand that rich&nbsp;
people are sitting on enormous piles of cash that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.920
was not there before Covid and that is because&nbsp;
our government chose to deal with the crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.400
with a purely printing money strategy so every&nbsp;
single penny that the government used to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.520
the economy during Covid-19 was a printed&nbsp;penny
they printed an enormous amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.080
this is not a normal well i think it's fair to&nbsp;
say a mature way to deal with an economic crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.920
you know a sensible economy when there's a crisis&nbsp;
the government says return to the richest people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480
in the country and say look there's a crisis&nbsp;
we need you to contribute more you know this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.720
is how a sensible country funds for example 
a&nbsp;war you know you can't put it on the backs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.720
people who can't afford it,  we have a small group of&nbsp;
very extremely wealthy people in this country they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.040
need to pay more but we didn't do that we didn't&nbsp;
turn to the rich and say you need to pay more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.240
instead we just printed the money and that money&nbsp;
ended up being held by the rich so rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.920
making the rich contribute to crisis we allowed&nbsp;
them to profit massively and that brings us on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.280
the next thing which people have to understand&nbsp;
which is that Covid; the first year of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.400
was the biggest ever single year increase&nbsp;
in wealth of the rich and super rich in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.480
this country ever and it was enormous the average&nbsp;
billionaire in this country increased their wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.960
by 630 million pounds in one year during Covid
the average billionaire and I'm not making those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.760
numbers up that's from The Times rich list okay&nbsp;
which probably underestimates it to be honest so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.360
number one thing to understand is that the&nbsp;
rich have accumulated a huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.440
number two is that the super rich have increased&nbsp;
their wealth enormously during Covid and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.920
worth stopping and thinking about that right&nbsp;
is that normal is that healthy is it healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.200
that when a country experiences&nbsp;
an enormous economic crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.840
the rich get massively richer: is that healthy?
i think that's the thing to think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.160
and then that brings us on to the next&nbsp;
point which is if you make the rich richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.480
by giving them a ton of cash how does that affect&nbsp;
ordinary people because i think it's easy as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.960
to be like well you know this is politics of envy&nbsp;
right why do you care if the rich get richer you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.440
know why why does it matter to you okay well what&nbsp;
happens what happens if you give a ton of cash to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.280
rich people you know stop and think for a bit&nbsp;
you know why does that matter to you well the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.640
reason is you know cash doesn't just sit in the&nbsp;
bank account right people use cash to buy things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.440
and if you know if you go to the supermarket and&nbsp;
suddenly there's one guy in the supermarket who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.880
got like a million pounds he could pay way more&nbsp;
for everything than you can and anything you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.040
he can pay more for it so it's going to push&nbsp;
the price up you know this is most obvious in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.800
the case of house prices right because ordinary&nbsp;
people haven't accumulated cash during Covid but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.200
the wealthy i've got 60 or 70 grand per adult so&nbsp;
it's 140 grand if there's two adults in the family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.320
well of course they're going to be able to buy the&nbsp;
house and your kid won't be able to buy the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.520
you see what i'm saying here so i think if you&nbsp;
deal with a crisis by giving money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.000
number one ordinary people&nbsp;
don't know that's happened

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.160
number two prices will go up and then number three&nbsp;
ordinary people wont understand how or why&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.240
you see what i'm saying? the way we've managed with
the crisis it's like a magician's trick you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.320
they did this thing that meant everything seemed&nbsp;
to be solved without anyone having to be taxed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.800
but it meant somebody around the back you don't&nbsp;
know suddenly got 100 grand in their account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.880
and then they're pushing up the prices for&nbsp;
everything and you don't know why the prices have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.760
gone up and then the newspapers and the media just&nbsp;
say cost of living crisis it must be something to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:16.320
do with Vladimir Putin you know what i mean&nbsp;
as if we didn't just print 450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.760
which ended up in the bank accounts of richer&nbsp;
people i think it's it's unbelievable the lack of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.360
understanding that's happening what we're seeing&nbsp;
now is you know i've got two economic degrees

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.680
right 1 from London School of Economics and &nbsp;
1 from Oxford and unfortunately the state of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.480
economic profession is an absolute disaster now&nbsp;
most economists just have no idea what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.440
they're totally disconnected they don't you&nbsp;
know i was on a call with a bunch of economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.240
and i said you know they're they're just talking&nbsp;
about supply side issues blah blah blah and 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.560
i said well do you think it could be because of the&nbsp;
massive amount of printed money that was given out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.000
and one of the economists said there's no&nbsp;
way it's that because it was only about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.560
Â£200-300 per person that got printed and&nbsp;
you can go and look at the numbers and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.880
Â£10,000 per person right what is happening&nbsp;
right now the economics discipline once again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.360
is absolutely asleep at the wheel so you have&nbsp;
a situation where a ton of money was printed

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.960
Â£10,000 per adult -  Â£450,000,000,000 *IN TOTAL*&nbsp;
that's all gone to wealthy people of course that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.200
going to push prices up prices have been pushed&nbsp;
up and none of the economists are talking about&nbsp;it&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.160
the reason that is so important is because if&nbsp;none 
of the economists understand what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.600
then this does not get fixed simple as that&nbsp;
simple as that right and you know the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.880
i am a millionaire is because i predicted that&nbsp;
the 2008 crisis would not be fixed because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.800
was to do with inequality and the economists were&nbsp;
not talking about inequality and now the 2022 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.680
which will be the next 10 years of economic crisis&nbsp;
will not be fixed either because it's a crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.040
of massive cash accumulation given to rich people&nbsp;
that nobody's talking about and nobody's gonna fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.000
and you know all of the newspapers owned by&nbsp;
billionaires so they're super happy about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.840
you know the chancellor is a billionaire he's&nbsp;
super happy about it the prime minister will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.200
be will make millions of pounds as soon as he&nbsp;
quits office so he's super happy about it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.160
it's not gonna get fixed okay and i know that's&nbsp;
depressing to hear but that is the situation right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.480
i want everybody out there to understand we will&nbsp;
continue to have a cost of living crisis of cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.560
living going up higher than wages as long as we&nbsp;
allow the rich and the super rich to accumulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:32.000
these enormous amounts of money okay so what&nbsp;
needs to be done okay so once you accept that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.880
dealt with the crisis by printing a ton of money&nbsp;
that ended up with the rich and the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.560
it should be obvious that the way to fix that&nbsp;
is to take money back from the rich and super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.120
rich which is exactly what i suggested&nbsp;
in my first video on the channel again if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.080
you haven't watched it you really should go&nbsp;
and watch it it's definitely worth watching

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.760
so are we doing that are we taking money back from&nbsp;
the rich and super rich well no definitely not in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.120
fact we've raised taxes on ordinary workers whilst&nbsp;
not raising taxes at all on super rich people

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.640
so what we're doing instead&nbsp;
we're raising interest rates okay

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.520
it's worth pointing out that raising interest&nbsp;
rates is not the opposite of giving money to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.560
the rich you know if you want to fix giving&nbsp;
money to the rich the answer is tax the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.720
take money back from the rich if you want to fix&nbsp;
the Covid economic problem that is what you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.880
to do we're not doing that we're raising interest&nbsp;
rates so what does raising interest rates mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.800
that means that if you are a person&nbsp;
who has debts so if you have a mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.040
um well yeah that's the big one if you have a&nbsp;
mortgage if you have student debt for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.400
you will pay more money to the people who&nbsp;
people who hold cash those are the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.600
from whom you borrow which is rich people&nbsp;
the other group of people which has a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.280
amount more debt now since pre Covid is&nbsp;
the government so basically taxpayers so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.440
we caused the crisis or the government caused&nbsp;
the crisis by giving a ton of money to rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.840
people instead of taxing them and now to&nbsp;
fix the crisis we're going to say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.920
mortgage holders and taxpayers should pay more&nbsp;
money every month to the rich that's the that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:18.000
the proposed solution from our chancellor whose 
father's&nbsp;a billionaire and who's worth Â£200,000,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.400
so this is gonna get worse unfortunately because&nbsp;
now we've created a situation where the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.240
and everyone who has debt is gonna have to pay&nbsp;
more money every month to these rich people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.840
are stacking up money in their bank accounts so&nbsp;
the problem's not gonna get fixed unfortunately um

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.240
if we want to fix the problem then we need to&nbsp;
address the underlying problem of inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:52.160
because when you give a ton of money to rich&nbsp;
people it doesn't just cause an inflation problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.000
it also exacerbates an already existing inequality&nbsp;
problem right we already had growing inequality in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.800
the 20s before that and now we've suddenly given a&nbsp;
massive chunk of cash to the rich people and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.520
is the reason why not only are prices increasing&nbsp;
but they're increasing in such an unequal way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.320
right rich people want to own assets they want&nbsp;
to own their natural resources they don't spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.000
a huge amount of money on paying people's wages&nbsp;
whereas ordinary people spend all their cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.920
straight away so if the money accumulates with&nbsp;
the rich you're going to see asset prices go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.440
and you're going to see natural resource prices&nbsp;
go up and you're going to see wages stay steady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:40.240
so because of this massive increase in inequality&nbsp;
what you're going to see is and i think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.000
important that people understand this you know if&nbsp;
we had just an inflation where all the prices went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.280
up together it wouldn't actually be that bad right&nbsp;
okay energy price has gone up food prices gone up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.680
but your wage has gone up by exactly the same so&nbsp;
actually you're pretty much fine but when you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.160
an inflation crisis with an inequality crisis&nbsp;
alongside it you also see the prices of assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.760
and the price of natural resources which basically&nbsp;
means your food and energy going up higher than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.600
your wage so it creates this cost of living&nbsp;
crisis so i think whenever you hear the words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.320
cost of living crisis i want you to interpret that&nbsp;
as inequality crisis because that is essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:21.440
what it is and we saw a very similar thing happen&nbsp;
after 2008 when essentials (food, energy, housing)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.400
those prices went up wages didn't and&nbsp;
that's because we dealt with a 2008 crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.960
just in the same way we we are dealing with the&nbsp;
2020 crisis by massively increasing inequality so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.120
if we want to change this it's very important&nbsp;
that we reframe the way this crisis is described&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.240
away from being a cost of living crisis&nbsp;
and towards what it actually is which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.960
an inequality crisis and that we understand that&nbsp;
Covid massively increased inequality that's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.640
being talked about in the media at all and&nbsp;
now we understand that code would cause a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.960
massive increase in cash accumulation by richer&nbsp;
people that's not being talked about at all so

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.200
what i'm hoping people take away from this is&nbsp;
a very clear understanding of what's happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.200
we dealt with the crisis by printing money that&nbsp;
money ended up with the rich that caused two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.880
simultaneous crises one of inequality and&nbsp;
one of inflation and together they caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.280
what we're calling a cost of living crisis but&nbsp;
fundamentally it's being caused by this massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.320
gift essentially of cash from government&nbsp;
to rich people and the only way to fix it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.960
is to take money back from the rich people um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.640
we're we're filming this just after the Russian&nbsp;
invasion of Ukraine - i'm not going to pretend i'm a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.240
war expert because i'm not i'm just going to focus&nbsp;
on how this is going to affect people economically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.600
and as you probably predict it's not good news um&nbsp;
these are regions which export a lot of energy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.240
food basically to the west um to europe to western&nbsp;
europe and uh it's going to cause these prices to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.360
go up even more so what we are going to see&nbsp;
now is even more increasing energy price even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.960
more increasing food price at the worst possible&nbsp;
time and i want everybody watching to understand

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.040
that does not cause a cost of living crisis&nbsp;
for everyone because there's a small minority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.080
people in this country who remember have made&nbsp;
their biggest ever increase in wealth in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.760
last two years so these guys are laughing they&nbsp;
can afford to pay a little bit more for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.520
food and energy they can afford to pay it the&nbsp;
people who are suffering are ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.560
and this is this is not simply a law of nature&nbsp;
this is because we dealt with a crisis in such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.800
way that the rich got enormous gifts of money and&nbsp;
ordinary people got tax rises you know it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.120
have to be this way it can be changed but only&nbsp;
if we reframe this crisis as what it really is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.880
a crisis of inequality and if we do something&nbsp;
about it which has to mean taxing the rich

00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.011
Any Good.... Yeah?
