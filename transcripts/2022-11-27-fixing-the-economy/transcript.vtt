00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.800
Welcome to Gary's Economics 
today we're going to&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.600
the perfect tax which is not a&nbsp;tax at all
the 120-year wealth time limit

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.980
okay so I want to do a video on an idea called&nbsp;
"The Wealth Time Limit" because I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.080
super interesting but it also explains a little&nbsp;
bit well I think it answers a couple of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.660
common questions that we get on this channel&nbsp;
which are do you want to raise my taxes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.280
why do you want to increase taxation on the&nbsp;
rich and also another one which is what do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.940
you think is the best way to tax the rich so&nbsp;
um a few years ago I made this website called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.560
wealth economics and I really recommend looking&nbsp;
at it if you're interested in understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.100
basically why is I care so much about wealth&nbsp;
inequality and also what wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
does to the economy from the perspective of
ordinary families and ordinary people's lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.500
and a lot of people ask me when I put&nbsp;
that website up 'well how do we fix it?' and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
you know I had the long think about what would&nbsp;
be the best way to fix wealth inequality and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.260
I came up with this idea called 'The Wealth Time&nbsp;
Limit' and the idea behind the wealth time limit is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
you can make as much wealth as you want you&nbsp;
don't pay tax on it you can give it to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
kids you can give it to your grandkids&nbsp;
but once you hit your 120th birthday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.980
wealth is gone basically so when you give it&nbsp;
to your kids it's in a trust which has your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.140
120th birthday on it because your grandkids&nbsp;
has your 120th birthday on it which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.380
basically you can give as much wealth as you&nbsp;
want to your kids your grandkids even your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.940
great grandkids but it has to be spent by your&nbsp;
120th birthday now what is nice about this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.920
that it's a zero tax solution right there's no&nbsp;
tax there it's a time limit so say you inherit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
10 million pounds from your granddad um and&nbsp;
your granddad was 80 years old you know you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.780
got 40 years to spend that 10 million pounds and&nbsp;
since you know exactly the time limit you'll make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.620
sure that you spend all that money before the&nbsp;
time limit so what is interesting about this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.060
a zero tax solution simply a time limit nobody&nbsp;
is getting taxed here but what does happen is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.940
very wealthy people they know that they have&nbsp;
a fixed amount of time with which they need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.400
spend all of the wealth that they've accumulated&nbsp;
and just to make it clear they can't just spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.900
the money buying houses if you buy a house it&nbsp;
stays in a trust or buying stocks such as it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.440
stays in the trust you basically if you inherit&nbsp;
huge amounts of money you are forced to spend that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.580
money over time and what that means is very very&nbsp;
wealthy families will have to enormously increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.560
their spending so if you consider us you know&nbsp;
a family that is worth you know a billion quid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.660
you know like Rishi Sunak's family you know&nbsp;
Rishi Sunak is I guess he's sort of 45 or something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.820
they would have 75 years to spend a billion quid&nbsp;
and that's really difficult actually because even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.660
over 75 years you're going to need to spend more&nbsp;
than 10 million pounds a year to run that down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.700
and that's not accounting for the fact that&nbsp;
Rishi Sunak probably makes from that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.080
30 million-40 million pounds a year so&nbsp;
what it means is super rich families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.640
have the massively massively increase their&nbsp;
spending and this would have the consequence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.200
massively increasing wages for working people&nbsp;
because you'd suddenly see a huge amount of demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.300
for goods and services because these rich people&nbsp;
would suddenly be spending huge amounts of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.200
what it would also do is make assets like housing&nbsp;
like stocks and shares suddenly much much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.900
affordable for working people because on the one&nbsp;
hand wages have gone up a lot on the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.780
rich people very rich families would know that&nbsp;
they can't simply sit on huge amounts of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.700
and grow it over time they have to sell that&nbsp;
which means that wealth is going to go back into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.880
the economy back to working people so it would&nbsp;
create an economy where wages are super high where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.840
ordinary workers can afford things like houses and&nbsp;
property and basically where ordinary people can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:25.140
rich off the back of work and I think this shows&nbsp;
that really what matters is that wealth flows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.660
around the economy not just from ordinary families&nbsp;
to the rich but from the rich back to ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.220
families because at the moment we have a system&nbsp;
where over time I think it's becoming clearer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.440
and clearer that the wealth of ordinary families&nbsp;
is becoming smaller and smaller and smaller over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.760
time over generations and and that is passing to&nbsp;
the wealth of the rich and the very rich and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.080
that happens then it's obvious ordinary people&nbsp;
will get poorer and living standards will fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.240
but if you have a time limit it forces the rich&nbsp;
to send that wealth back through the economy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.320
it means that working people will be able to&nbsp;
access that wealth and get rich themselves and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.580
um I think what this shows is that it's not really&nbsp;
simply a question of do you want High tax or do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.160
you want Low tax it's a question of do you want&nbsp;
an economy where the rich get richer and ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.500
people get poorer or do an economy where everybody&nbsp;
has the opportunity to get rich if they work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.180
um and I think what this shows is I'm not in&nbsp;
this because I want to raise taxes I'm in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.820
because I want to improve living standards&nbsp;
for ordinary people but I firmly believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.080
on the basis of what I've seen and what I've&nbsp;
done in my career that the only way to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.880
is to create an economy where wealth flows around&nbsp;
rather than where wealth simply flows upwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.760
so um yeah that's the idea it's the wealth time&nbsp;
limit I think it's really interesting to see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.440
you can make a really thriving economy even with&nbsp;
the low tax economy if you force the rich to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.720
assets back to working people over time um this&nbsp;
is not at all to say that I'm opposed to any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.200
the policies which increase taxation of the rich&nbsp;
I'm super supportive of those policies because I &nbsp;

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.380
know that if nothing is done to get wealth flowing&nbsp;
from the super rich back to ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.540
then we are going to see the economy get worse and&nbsp;
worse and worse over time but it's simply to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.540
it's not simply a question of high tax or low&nbsp;
tax you know you could have an economy which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.020
is high tax on the rich and very low tax and&nbsp;
ordinary workers and that would be much better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.240
than the economy now which is actually often high&nbsp;
tax on workers and low tax on the very rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.520
or you could have an economy which is you know&nbsp;
very low tax on the rich but forces the rich to&nbsp;give

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.400
that wealth back but at the moment what we&nbsp;have
is very low tax on the richest, high tax on&nbsp;workers

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.140
and no mechanism to get wealth flowing back&nbsp;
around and if that's what you have it's inevitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.520
that wealth will flow from ordinary people to the&nbsp;
rich and the economy will get worse and worse so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.600
um yeah there were time limit is a nice idea it's&nbsp;
just an idea for you to think about to realise&nbsp;that 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.180
what really matters is not so much the level&nbsp;
of tax but really the balance of power in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.620
economy and the direction of travel at the moment&nbsp;
we have an economy where the rich are extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.400
powerful and they're getting richer &amp; richer &amp; richer&nbsp;
ordinary people are getting poorer &amp; poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.740
over time and that will obviously lead us to&nbsp;a bad 
place but it's not inevitable there's lots&nbsp;of ways

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.480
to think of... there's lots of ways to fix&nbsp;it &amp; lots of 
ways to think about it so something&nbsp;to think about

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.160
put a comment; let me know what&nbsp;you think
um and uh yeah I hope you found it interesting

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.000
*i have a question... if we use this time limit... 
it sounds like a good idea for the long term*

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
*but in the short term... 
would it really change anything?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.780
well&nbsp;it would! 
if it was actually implemented well&nbsp;

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.760
because if you for the very... if you're a&nbsp;very
rich family you know if you are 50 years old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.920
and you're a billionaire you know&nbsp;70 years 
is not a long time to spend a&nbsp;billion quid&nbsp;

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.540
so the very rich families would&nbsp;have to start 
spending straight away from now because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.700
they know that you know we have&nbsp;to we 
have to we have to spend that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.740
we can't we can't keep it forever so it would&nbsp;
create an enormous immediate economic stimulus

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.000
*part of the problem you've described already... but&nbsp;
wouldn't they just spend it on our mum's house?* &nbsp;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.840
well this is the thing if you the idea is anything you 
buy&nbsp;with the money in the trust stays in the trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.000
so if you use the money to buy somebody's house&nbsp;
it doesn't solve your problem right because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.860
need to anything you still have in there when&nbsp;
you hit 120 is gone so it it doesn't make any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.660
sense whether it's to use that to buy assets&nbsp;
because they can't keep them the idea is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.440
you have to sell those assets back into the&nbsp;economy 
you have to keep those assets moving around

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:46.440
*that makes sense, I can't think of any other questions* 
it's all right, it's no problem, great idea, also check out

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.340
www.wealtheconomics.org if people are interested 
it's&nbsp;this good website it's went up a long time ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.460
it's really nice; nicely explains the ideas

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.680
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.820
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying Economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.500
and think thanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
