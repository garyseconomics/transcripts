00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.240
okay welcome back to Gary's Economics for this

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.000
the last video in this season of the channel

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm gonna take a break

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.320
I'm going away for a couple of months

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.480
so I wanted to make a video

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
looking back over what has unambiguously been

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.560
the most mental season of Gary's Economics so far

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.920
okay

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440
so what have we done this season on Gary's Economics

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.320
we've only been back about four months

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.480
in that time I think we have been one of the fastest

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.920
if not the fastest

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160
growing YouTube channels in the entire country

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.040
we've successfully

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.960
pissed off a big chunk of the most annoying people

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.800
and newspapers in the entire country

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.080
we have effectively driven wealth

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.800
taxes and the idea that we need to tax wealth

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
not work

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000
really aggressively into the public conversation

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360
we started to achieve the things which

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.360
I've wanted to achieve for a long time and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.560
that's basically thanks to you guys

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.840
last time I put the channel on pause was

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.880
last year we shot

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.520
I think at the beginning of July or the end of June

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.760
and it was just after the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.920
general election had been called and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.480
I was quite knackered then

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.160
probably not as knackered as I am now

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.320
but I got quite emotional in that video

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.920
I watched it back

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.760
and the reason I got emotional was because I said

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.800
in that video

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.600
it's I I worked really

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.440
hard last year

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.920
we had the channel running for most of the first

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520
like 2/3 of the year

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.920
and then when the election got called it

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.480
the channel grew massively

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.560
but when the election got called

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320
a little bit earlier than I was expecting

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
it was just really clear to me that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.000
that we weren't gonna be able

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.360
I wasn't gonna be able to influence the election

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.000
it was really clear that Labour were gonna win

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.680
but it was really clear

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.320
we weren't gonna be able to influence their pitches

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.280
their policies

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.800
and I think I said at the time of the video

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.280
it's difficult when you've worked so hard

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.640
to look at how much work you've done

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.360
and how far you've come and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.680
and then to look up and realise how much further

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160
you have to go before you can have any power

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.360
before you can have any impact

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.400
and it was I was a little bit depressed to be honest

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.560
at the making that video

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.400
but now filming this 17th of April 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.320
this time we're putting the channel on pause

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.720
it looks realistically I'm not just saying this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.160
it looks like something that eventually we

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.960
we could maybe win

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.760
the speed of the growth of this channel and this

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.120
this message

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.480
in this last season

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440
the last four months has been just unbelievably big

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.520
it it was for periods

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.920
the fastest growing YouTube channel in the country

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920
which it which is insane for a channel

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.400
which is essentially talking about about

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.280
redistribute politics and economics

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.080
every newspaper in the country been speaking about it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.880
during this season we had the Spring Statement

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.080
which is kind of like a mini budget here in the UK

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.200
for those who don't know and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.000
during the coverage of that budget

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600
I think the single

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720
most prominent

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.480
criticism of the government's economic policies

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.520
during that period

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.760
was why are you not taxing the rich more

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760
you know that's not just us

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.080
and that's not just this channel that's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.320
that's pushed that message

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.760
but I think a big part of it has been us and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.960
I have said before on this channel and I've

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.360
I've thought for a while

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000
I've been very confident for a long time

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.520
that the economy would get worse

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.760
because of this worsening wealth inequality

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.920
and that would move the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.160
economic and political conversation

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.800
into a space where people demanded something

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.400
new and I was of the opinion for a long time

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.200
and I still probably am that the new

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.760
this new right this alt-right

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.040
the far right whatever you want to call them

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.400
the anti immigrant right

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.720
would eventually win power in a number of countries

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.040
really quite simply

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.120
because they were the only political

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.160
solution on the table

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880
that felt like something new on the economy

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.400
and I believe for a long time

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.640
that if we can get this idea on

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.440
the table

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.560
that there is an alternative

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.360
which is taxing the rich more

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.960
taxing workers less taxing wealth

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.800
not work

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.280
that we could have a really good chance of winning

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.240
policy change in the long run

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.520
and for a long time it felt kind of unbelievable

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.800
kind of unachievable

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.920
because it just didn't seem like there was any demand

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.640
in the kind of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.680
halls of power

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.920
it didn't seem like anybody was talking about it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.560
it didn't seem like we could get it into the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.000
overton window to use a term

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.440
I introduced a couple of videos

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.760
to get it onto the table basically and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.320
it is just the first step and to some degree

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.680
it is only in this country

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.760
but we've got it onto the table

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.280
in the last four months

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.240
we have got that onto the table

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.120
and this is now something that politicians

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.280
have to talk about

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.400
it's something that politicians get asked all the time

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.160
it's something they have to have an idea about

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.400
we've obviously not won the Labour Party over yet

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.520
which are the party in government

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.400
we've not won the government over yet

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.920
but I never expected to win them

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.080
now I think I've said very clearly on the channel

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.600
my plan was to

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.120
make this something that we can

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.960
hopefully force Labour to do

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.560
coming to the next election

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.520
and the unbelievable growth in this channel

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.440
the unbelievable growth in this message in the last

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.880
four months makes me really for the first time in

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.400
in the history of doing this channel

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.200
makes me feel this is genuinely something

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.960
that we can achieve generally something that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.320
that we can win and

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.600
that is something that I am very proud of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.360
and it's something you can be very proud of

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.920
because ultimately this is a YouTube channel

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.000
it is increasingly a political movement

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.520
which bases entirely

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.960
its power on its popularity with the public

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.920
its popularity with you

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.480
its growth comes from people like you

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.080
telling your friends

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.960
telling your families telling your mum

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.240
like I always say

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760
it's working you know

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.480
the reason that think tanks lobby

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.360
the politicians instead of speaking to the public

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.600
is because they don't think it works

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.320
they don't think you guys are powerful

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.760
they don't think you guys have power

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.280
they don't think there's any point talking to you

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.480
they don't think there's any point

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.280
basing movement on you and educating you and

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.960
and we are proving them wrong

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.680
and that's something we should all be very proud of

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.720
but basically I'm totally knackered

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.040
we used to shoot every three weeks

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.200
and we would try to shoot three or four

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.760
or maybe even five videos on a shoot day

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.080
and that was how we did it but

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.760
I've been so tired the last few weeks

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.040
that I have been unable to shoot more than one video

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.840
a shoot day

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.680
which has meant that I have to shoot every week

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.760
which means in the end

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.880
I probably am ending up doing more work

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.160
because I'm shooting every week

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.280
I think the quality of the videos

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.080
if I say so myself has been really

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.920
really good

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.520
well done also to Jack for his fantastic editing

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.640
I think the quality has been really good this season

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.880
but the flip side of that is it's just

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.440
really taken out of me and I'm quite knackered

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.640
which means we're not gonna be able to reshoot

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.720
we're shooting this on the Thursday

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.880
it's gonna go out on the Sunday

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.360
and it will be the last video of the season

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.840
and it'll be a couple of months break

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.000
but I'll be back so for now just quickly the recap

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.160
when I think back to this season

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960
I always think the video I did with Aaron

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.200
Bastani at Novara

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.400
right at the beginning of this press campaign and

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.720
the first question he asked me was

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.360
were you surprised by how well the hardback did

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.120
so the hardback came out last year

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.360
and it was No. 1 for two weeks

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.760
and I always ask these guys not to send me the questions

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.800
before cause I like to sort of be

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.680
kind of actually answering them in the moment

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.960
rather than trying to like

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.560
remember my rehearsed answer

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.200
but I said to him

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.160
I was disappointed that the book didn't do better

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.760
because I thought

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.560
I thought the book got like

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.880
mischaracterized as a kind of a finance book

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.320
and I thought that it was actually a really good story

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.080
and I thought it had the capacity to do

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.200
to be much more than like No. 1 for two weeks

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.400
and maybe people thought that was quite arrogant

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.120
at the time but

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.120
it's been number one for 11 weeks and

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.760
I'll be honest I didn't expect it to do that much

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.960
and I think that kind of encapsulates

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.440
how I feel about this whole season

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.120
which was

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.160
the YouTube grew six times sub numbers last year

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.320
and I didn't think

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.840
we could possibly keep growing at that rate

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.320
but then we've grown

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.920
like two and a half times in the last three months

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.000
basically everything this season was way bigger than

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.040
I expected the book sold way better

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.600
the growth in the subscriber numbers and the views was

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.520
like dramatically more than I expected

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.200
the increase in like

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.400
public recognition that I get and like public sort of

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.600
critique and the increasing like

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.800
recognition on the streets has all been just like crazy

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.600
it has been absolutely crazy

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.120
for me personally

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.680
that is like amazing this was always

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.280
like the plan for the political project

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.920
but it's been quite a lot for me

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.560
personally and

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.840
it's been knackering

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.960
and I worry a little bit about how this channel

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.520
is gonna work for me

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.240
like long term from a mental health perspective

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.600
especially if it keeps growing and I think politically

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.240
you know if we wanna win

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.080
I need to to make the channel keep growing

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.680
but I need to find ways to make sure like

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.920
we find that balance where the channel is growing

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.560
but I'm not going insane basically

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.840
that brings me onto my next point

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.800
which I've got written down here

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.440
which is how can we win so obviously

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.920
I'm going away for a couple of months

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.960
and I want to talk a little bit about when I go away

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.760
I've taken breaks the last two years

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.280
this one will be a little bit shorter

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.000
there's always two reasons I go away

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.840
which is 1 to stop me from going insane and 2

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.920
because the channel has been going really quickly for

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.280
about two years now and every time the channel grows

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.120
I need to kind of take a step back

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.040
and reassess the situation politically and be like

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.360
what are we gonna need to be effective politically

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.120
in the next couple of years

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.400
 the channel is much bigger now than it was even

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.880
3 or 4 months ago

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.120
so what are we gonna need now in order to win

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.200
so I think the first thing to say is

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.920
I think what

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.680
the last four months have proven is that the

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.680
the very basic strategy

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.240
has a lot of potential which is

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240
I think there is

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.720
like a massive demand amongst the public for like

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.960
a very clear simple economic political message

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.000
which is

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.360
the reason we are getting poorer

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.800
is because of this massive growth in inequality

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.480
and we're not gonna fix that

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.160
unless we stop that inequality from growing

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.320
the inequality of wealth from growing

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.320
I think that is powerful for a number of reasons

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.920
one because it's true

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.760
I think that is the biggest thing, two

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.600
because it's simple, three

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.960
it doesn't like

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.640
muddy itself

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.320
by trying to deal with loads of issues at once

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.240
it just aggressively deals with this one issue

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.280
of worsening living standards and worsening inequality

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.120
so I think that course is running that can work

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.880
that will work and I would encourage

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.640
other people to look at that and say

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:56.880
you know

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.200
this is a message that that can win politically

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.640
the second thing is I think this

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.880
I think the slogan tax wealth not work

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.680
has a lot of has a lot of legs in it

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.640
you know I know

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.360
I don't really love condensing things into slogans

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.640
but the truth is you know

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.800
I think you do need to do that if you if you wanna win

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.720
so I think the first thing is like

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.080
I think this is a winning strategy

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.640
I think if enough people get behind this

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.160
if enough people support this

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.680
we can win power on this

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.280
and we can change policy on this

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.360
just a very clean

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.760
simple economic message

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.080
the reason living standards are falling

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.200
is because wealth inequality is growing

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.560
the rich are making enormously more money

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.120
the middle class

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.880
and working class are getting squeezed out

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.320
the only way to fix it is to stop growing inequality

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.680
to tax wealth not work

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.960
I honestly think that can win

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.120
I honestly think that can win

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.440
but there are some clear weaknesses that I see

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.400
I think the obvious

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.120
like the really

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.480
really obvious weakness at the moment is that

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.720
at the moment this idea and these like

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:04.840
slogans is just like way too tied to my personal

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.440
like brand if you wanna call it that

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.160
like my like media identity

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.240
and you can see that in the way that

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.960
like the right wing press has

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.880
especially in the last like month or so

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.440
just like

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.760
really aggressively tried to attack me as a person

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.200
like they're not really engaging with the ideas

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.000
it's just like can we somehow attack Gary Stevenson

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.760
can we take him out

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.120
and that is because they can see that at the moment

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.680
the idea the economic ideas are really solid

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.880
but they are so attached to me as a person

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.200
that if you can take me out

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.800
you can kind of like kill the movement

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.000
so I think what that shows

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.720
us is that we absolutely need in the long run

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.200
more people doing it we need more diversity of voice

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.640
I think in particular

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.920
we need what I I'm thinking of as academic cover

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.520
which is economists people at think tanks

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.280
people with this kind of academic credentials

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.280
I have got two

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.240
economics degrees from two top universities

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.360
but because I am a Youtuber now

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.920
and because I look and sound working class

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.480
it's very

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.240
very important that we have these this academic cover

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.320
so I think we really

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.000
really need more support from these think tanks

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.000
especially the left wing think tanks

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.880
like the New Economics Foundation

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.080
like IPPR like the Resolution Foundation

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.840
they really need to be coming in and doing work on this

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.240
I would love to see more economists from from academia

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.760
writing papers on this speaking publicly on this

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.200
looking into things like the squeezing out of wealth

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.960
of the middle class where's the wealth going

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960
you know what would the dynamics of that be

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.480
how does that affect living standards

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.120
we need more academic cover

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.720
but we don't need just academics

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.640
we just need way more diversity of voice in general

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.960
so one thing that I've seen

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.960
which I've really liked

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.720
it's been very meaningful to me personally is

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720
is when like

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.120
different kinds of communicators and artists come in

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.160
so there was a clip of me on the

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.360
on the Rizzle Kicks album

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.360
Jordan Stevens who I know a little bit

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.240
they put me on the on the album

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.520
somebody sent us a cartoon

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.280
they'd be making based on the

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.320
the educational series learning the economy

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.720
which is on this channel

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.520
that stuff is really powerful as well

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.320
I think I would love to see more communicators

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.320
I think when we get loads and loads of messages

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.560
like tons of messages of people like

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.880
we love what you're doing

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.680
how can we help you can I come and work for you

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.320
how can we help and it's impossible really

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.120
for me to even read all these messages

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.920
never even reply to these messages

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.320
so what I wanna do is tell you don't come to me

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.200
just do it

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.120
just understand the messages and just do it

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.480
just go make the thing you know

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.960
this guy is making the cartoon making the music

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.520
you know

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.280
whatever you wanna do you wanna print stickers

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.040
you wanna make merch

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.600
I'm not gonna sue anybody for making any merch

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.760
using our name

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.520
or making any art using our ideas or make any music

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.400
like taking clips just go make it do the thing

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.720
I wanna see more influencers coming through

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.080
talking about these ideas

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.840
I wanna see economists talking about these ideas

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.320
I wanna see artists making art

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.760
I wanna see musicians making music you know

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.560
stickering campaigns, I would never

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.000
ever encourage anyone to do a graffiti campaign

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.120
or a stickering campaign or a posting campaign

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.040
just do the thing

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.120
do the thing that you wanna do that do the thing

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.280
use your skill

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.920
and if that means just like

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.760
make a little community group

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.720
talking to your community

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.080
and there's the thing which I always encourage just

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.560
just go and do it share the message

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.760
but when I say that

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.480
I always wanna caveat that with the thing I always say

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.280
which is this is not a thing we win today or tomorrow

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.440
or next week or next year

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.320
I don't wanna tell you like go out

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.040
do it go out and do it

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.120
go out and do it and then have you run out

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.440
exert a ton of energy exhaust yourself and then

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.160
be knackered and depressed that we haven't won

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.760
find a way to use your skills

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.440
or your community to build this message

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.840
over the long term in a way that's sustainable for you

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.520
and your mental health but

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.560
what we really need

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.960
what I really need is for this message

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.880
these ideas to not be so associated

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.000
with just

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.520
particularly me and my name and this YouTube channel so

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:19.840
you know

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.760
if you're a young person thinking about what to study

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.880
and you're willing to go study economics

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.320
go study economics

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.360
f you're an economist nowadays

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.280
go and write papers on these ideas and whatever

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.440
if you can get in the civil service

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.720
if you can get into government

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.640
if you can create something

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.200
if you can make a little group that wants to meet

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.160
and talk about these things

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.560
just basically build it build it yourself

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.920
go and do it

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.440
don't try and like pile everything up on top of my head

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.400
because

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.720
there's only so much

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.680
I can balance on my head before I go totally insane

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.200
that's another thing 

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.040
the other big risk I think to

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.720
to this movement is is really my mental health

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.600
to be honest

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.840
I think anyone who's read my book

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.880
you know my book

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.400
is partially about you know

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.960
me experiencing a burnout

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
me overworking

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.160
I think there's a kind of like irony to the book

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.920
which is like the book was supposed to be in a way

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.040
like a criticism of modern culture which

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.360
which really lionizes like hard work and ambition

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.480
there's a quote by not Shakespeare

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.920
but a contemporary of Shakespeare

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.920
which is ambition is a great man's madness

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.520
and I wanted to try and sell a story of

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.120
of a way of living which was a bit more balanced

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.640
that we didn't have to be totally obsessed about

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.680
working hard and achieving um

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.800
and I locked myself

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.520
in my room for nine months to write a book

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.360
about that that was supposed to be a best seller

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.320
and now it is 11 weeks a best seller

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.360
and now I've got this massive YouTube channel

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.680
and I'm working my absolute tits off

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.280
driving myself mad

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.920
I need to find ways

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.360
if this is gonna keep growing and growing

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.000
and growing and growing it's gonna be difficult for me

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.760
and I need to figure out like

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.600
how I can manage that personally

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.280
on that note I wanted to really thank

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.520
everyone who's subscribed to the Patreon

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.360
like last year

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.520
we were funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.680
this year they they didn't renew our funding

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.040
which meant we came into this year

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.160
basically the only way that we could have funded it

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.600
was basically me paying for it

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.960
we open the Patreon and

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.320
the patron guys have you know

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.520
they basically made it that I can have a manager

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.960
none of the money ever goes to me

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960
I didn't even see the money

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.000
there's a separate bank account

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.200
someone else managed it

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.960
and it means that I can totally focus on

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.920
all the creative work the political work

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.600
and I haven't had to focus on the financial work

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.840
so and also

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.640
it's just been really

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.320
just meaningful to me to see people like

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.680
willing to step in it and support it with

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.400
with their money

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.000
which makes it feel like it's not just me doing it um

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.200
and that means I can use

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.480
that money to think about things like

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.640
getting an assistant getting a PA

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.200
I think we are probably gonna need

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.600
somebody to do like outreach work

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.320
where they they can

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.560
I get tons of messages

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.240
so many messages from including like politicians

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.640
journalists celebrities

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.600
influencers people at these think thanks

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.280
and it's impossible for me to even keep on top of it

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.600
so we might be able to hire somebody to do that

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.560
and we're only able to do that

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.000
because of the guys who support the patreon

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.040
so I wanted to thank you specifically

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.120
everyone who's on the patreon

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.280
there are a few little loose ends

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.520
I wanna tie up before I go away

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.800
I plan to do another video before we stopped it

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.360
but like I'm just basically

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.320
I don't know if you've ever played the Sims

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.320
and I was like when you play the Sims

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.040
and you try to get your Sim to like

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.120
do some studying

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.040
and he's like so knackered that he just is like no

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.920
I refuse it

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.880
this is my own brain is doing to me at this point

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.720
like I'm I'm properly exhausted

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.720
but I wanted to do a couple of videos doing

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.000
covering just a couple of the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.080
the common critiques that we've had in the last

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.160
like couple of months

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.040
and I'm not gonna do that video

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.800
so I'm just gonna include them very quickly

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.600
in this one

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.480
one of the big criticisms we've had is that um

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.240
raising tax on on wealth is like

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.960
is pulling up the ladder you're

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.760
you're preventing people from being able to get rich

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760
now you are rich yourself

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.680
and this is just like totally insane

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.240
basically that

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.200
the whole thing I'm trying to do is

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.920
lower taxes on working people

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.320
and raise taxes on hoarded wealth

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.920
so that very very wealthy people have to sell assets

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.720
and those assets go back into the economy

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.320
and ordinary working people

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.320
get higher wages and pay lower taxes

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.480
and can afford to buy assets

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.000
like the whole thing I'm doing here

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.560
is trying to make it so that ordinary

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.240
working people

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.200
young working people who wanna produce good things

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.040
who wanna do good work can get rich and

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.880
and buy assets the other attack

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.440
which I get is that just like

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.520
I wanna increase taxes and

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.280
and increase the state

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.520
which is mad because I've always made it totally

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.240
totally clear that I'm not trying to increase taxes

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.000
I'm trying to change who pays taxes

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.000
I want to move the tax burden away from working people

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.520
and towards the super rich

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.400
and I think when you see how

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.480
like these attacks are constantly

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.560
attacks on things that I've never said

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.280
I think it kind of makes it clear

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.200
what is really happening here

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.440
which is you basically have a lot of rich people

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.000
who are just trying to find any way to

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.640
argue against the idea that they should pay more tax

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.320
it's a lot of rich people who control a lot of media

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.920
fund a lot of media they don't want to pay tax

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.360
the last thing was

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.720
this constant attack that I get which is well

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.800
taxing the rich is hard and

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.960
if you wanna tax the rich so much

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.520
can you please show me your like

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.760
completely designed tax plan

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.320
I think it should be clear at this point that I am

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.320
by far the the biggest and most recognized

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.960
public campaigner

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.120
for the need to stop growing inequality

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.240
and that there's quite a lot of pressure and work on

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.720
on just me to to push this campaign

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.000
I think we've had massive massive amount of success

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.920
but even just driving

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.520
the sort of public education campaign is really

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.800
really knackering for me and it's been a ton of work

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.040
it should be obvious

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.040
that I am not gonna be able to do that

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.360
and simultaneously by myself

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.360
design a complete tax plan for the country

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.680
and this is what I mean when I say we need more people

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.240
we need more people you know

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.720
I'm gonna call out like the think tanks

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.480
the left wing think tanks like where are you

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.000
we need you we need you guys to make these tax plans

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.400
I can't be the guy that wins the public

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.240
support for this

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.640
and gets attacked by the Daily Mail every day

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.040
and writes the whole plan

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.760
by myself like we need to have more people behind this

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760
more people behind this

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.400
so if there's any economists watching this

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.520
people in government

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.400
people in civil service and people in the think tanks

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.800
help us draw up these detailed tax proposals

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.480
because I'm knackered and I can't do it by myself

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.960
we need help we need help

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.680
the last thing I've got here is

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.240
the personal attacks on me

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.680
I don't really like doing these lists

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.400
but I'm so knackered

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.480
this is kind of all I've got left really

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.400
loads and loads of personal attacks on me

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.480
which to be honest

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.600
often are the funniest part of my day

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.360
the one thing I wanna say about this is

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.640
you know I'm in a very

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.280
very fortunate situation here

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.480
I don't need to win this I'm a rich guy

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.720
if we lose I'll continue to be a rich guy

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.200
I'll get richer and richer

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960
I don't need to win

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.920
so the Daily Mail can attack me all they want

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.200
when the Daily Mail attack me

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.400
what they're trying to do

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.760
is make sure that you pay higher taxes

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.480
and your family falls into poverty

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.880
and their billionaire owners don't have to pay tax

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.320
so really in a way

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.960
if the public can be convinced that I'm a dickhead

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.520
well I can finally go on holiday

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.680
it's your family's finances on the line

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.920
couple other things which I've got to tie up

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.120
we never answered

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.920
whether we’re gonna have Labour on the channel

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.080
thank you to everybody who

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.280
who replied about having Labour on the channel

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.840
I have decided first

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.600
I've been so knackered

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.000
I haven't really been able to seriously consider it

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.200
but I think what I'm gonna do is go back to them

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.480
and ask them if they would be willing to speak to me

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.560
not on the channel

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.840
about the economy and about their policy

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.640
because I think it has to be clear

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.120
I think our best chance in this country at least of

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.760
making change is is to influence the labour body

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.120
I think they will be

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.280
because the economy will continue to worsen

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.520
I think they will be like really phenomenally unpopular

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.480
and they will continue to become more unpopular

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.960
as we approach the next election

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.640
they'll be forced to do some change

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.720
and I want us to be able to influence that change

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.960
basically so I want

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.520
I want to be able to influence them

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.040
I don't think having them on this channel helps because

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.720
you know if I get them to send

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.920
you know Torsten Bell or someone on this channel

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.680
to defend not taxing the rich

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.280
and I have a massive argument with 

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.440
you know somebody who could be the next Labour leader

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.880
for all I know I don't think that helps us get

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.640
we’d probably get views on here especially

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.080
you know we’d probably get some

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.800
some subscribers

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.200
but I don't think it helps our political power

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.040
just like having a massive public fight with the exact

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.400
people that we need to influence

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.960
I'm gonna try to see if they're interested

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.480
interested in talking to me about policy

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.640
and if they're not then I'm probably not interested

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.320
in having them on the channel

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:00.760
second thing

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.880
very little one is as the channel is growing a lot

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.280
there's been a massive growth in scammers

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.920
trying to convince people to join

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.000
like online

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.680
WhatsApp groups and stuff

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.920
trying to sell like like crypto and trading scams

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.720
I would never do that if anybody approaches you

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.280
it's a scam

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.400
when this first came up

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.960
we would try to get these guys taken down

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.000
but like all it means

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.080
I spent 20 minutes getting a channel taken down

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.520
and they just open 10 more channels

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.040
so there's really nothing I can do

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.800
you can complain to Instagram if you want but 

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.040
just don't give any scammers your money

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.920
we don't sell any trading tips

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.440
and we never will okay

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.600
that's it basically yeah

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.280
lastly just yeah

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.600
thank you for just

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.120
the unbelievable growth it's

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.120
it's hard for me personally sometimes

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.720
as I've been

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.920
someone who has been betting on a weakening economy

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.000
for 14 years now and

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.200
and I'm very very confident that I'm right on this

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.240
I've made a lot of money on it

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.120
I think it's gonna keep happening

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.720
and the truth is in my heart of hearts

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.080
I've never really believed

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.800
that we could do anything to stop it

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.320
there is a little scene towards the end of my book

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.400
where when I used to be a trader

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.960
I'm speaking to my junior

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.960
an Australian guy in the book is called Arthur Kapowski

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.720
where I said to him like

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.520
do you think we should try and do something

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.760
about the collapsing economy

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.840
and he just didn't understand

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.320
and he just sort of laughed and he was like

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.120
you know there's nothing you can do

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.720
there's no way you can stop it and

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.280
the truth is like when I quit banking

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.560
I think in my heart of hearts

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.600
I believe that he was probably right

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.240
that it was kind of a fools errand that I was doing

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.760
walking away from a lot of money

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.920
to try to stop a bad thing from happening

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.880
which in reality

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.000
I would probably never be powerful enough to

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.320
to stop or even influence stopping

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.320
and I probably really did believe that

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320
until up to about a year ago

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.920
but don't believe that anymore

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.320
I think we can maybe do this so

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.480
so let's keep building let's keep building

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.680
I wanted to there was another video that I wanted to do

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680
which I've too knackered to do

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.760
which I'm gonna just tie in to the ending of this

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.840
I wanted to do a video this is so random

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.040
I wanted to do a video talking about the

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.960
the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.920
and the reason I wanted to do that video is because

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.280
a lot of people don't know this

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.800
but the Aztec empire

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.400
which was in what is now Mexico

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.960
was a massive empire with 

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.280
they think something like 12, 13

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.080
14 million people and the group of Spanish people

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.560
who eventually conquered the entire Aztec empire

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.560
was less than 3,000 people

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.320
and how was it that 3,000 people were able

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.120
to conquer and and destroy and

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.320
take all of the wealth and the land of an empire

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.520
which was you know more than 10 million people

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.520
what they did was they landed

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.520
they worked out the kind of political groupings

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.880
and they allied with the larger group

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.200
and they used that group to destroy the smaller group

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.720
and then

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.080
they split the larger group into smaller groups and

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.480
and they did the same thing again

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.600
they use the larger group to split into smaller groups

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.920
and through that repeated plan

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.160
3,000 people were able

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.680
to totally dominate and take all of the wealth

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.520
and all of the land of an empire of

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
you know 13 14

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.360
15 million people and

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.560
more than 10 million Aztecs died

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.320
at the hands of just

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.320
3,000 people.  This is what can happen

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.080
if ordinary people in society

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.800
allow themselves to be driven against each other

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.160
and to hate one another

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.320
that can allow a tiny tiny

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.720
tiny group of people to to take all of your wealth

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.880
to take all of your assets

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.720
and to totally destroy your civilization

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720
and your quality of life

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.200
and everything that you care about

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.280
this is the direction that

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.520
that we can go in

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.680
if ordinary people are unwilling or unable to

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.040
you know

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.120
look to the people that live either side of them

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.960
and stand with them to protect themselves from

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.920
from the rich and the powerful

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.520
and for a long time I thought that

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.560
in our increasingly individualistic society

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.000
because ordinary people were not sort of willing or not

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.960
not able to to look past their very narrow

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.280
selfish interests and stand next to each other

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.920
that they would lose

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.120
but the last few months

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.040
but I've seen so many people across the country

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.560
willing to take time out of their day

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.600
take effort to try and support a movement

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.120
that they don't gain anything from personally

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.600
because they know it's what the society needs

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.520
to protect each other

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.120
have made me believe that maybe

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.680
maybe we can win this

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.760
maybe we can stop wealth

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.320
flooding away from ordinary families

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.280
towards the rich

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.120
maybe we we can get that back and maybe we can win

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.040
but it's not going to be just me who wins it

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.000
and it's not going to depend really on me or what I do

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.920
it's going to depend

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.280
on you and how many of you

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.920
are willing and able

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.160
to spread that message and

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.720
I'm going away for a couple of months

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.160
I'm gonna be

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.040
yeah in Japan

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.560
Italy Portugal

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.680
Sweden and mainly promote my book

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.640
but when I come back

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.320
I wanna see more people making cool things

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.360
if they're gonna grind down

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.720
the ordinary people of this country

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.920
I want to

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.960
at least see you make some cool stuff on the way down

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.400
that's what's gonna help us win

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.360
you guys ordinary people

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.960
getting behind the simple idea that

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.320
if you don't stop growing wealth inequality

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.960
it will destroy living standards for ordinary families

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.080
for your kids and your grandkids

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.560
I've said it before I'll say it again

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.080
we're not gonna win this today

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.280
we're not gonna win this tomorrow

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.080
so um

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.400
be calm

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.120
be patient

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.320
be there for each other

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200
God knows you're gonna need each other

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.080
but keep building, if you keep building

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.240
