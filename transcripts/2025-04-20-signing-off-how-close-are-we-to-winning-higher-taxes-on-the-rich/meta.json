  "description": "In this last video before a break, Gary asks: just how close we are to convincing the government to tax the rich more? And reveals whether he's inviting Labour onto the channel or not. And discusses why the press have been attacking him. And explains where he's going exactly.\n\nGary will be doing a final Q&A with Patreons on 30 April before his break.
