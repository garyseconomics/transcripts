  "description": "Audio from Gary Stevenson's appearance on episode 62 of the Another Europe podcast with Luke Cooper & Zoe Williams - discussing wealth inequality.   Recorded July 27th 2020.\n\nAnother Europe Introduction:\nHe made a fortune in the last financial crisis betting against a recovery. Now one-time City trader Gary Stevenson tells his jaw-dropping story. He won his job in a card game at one of the world\u2019s top universities and was the most profitable trader globally at Citigroup in 2011. But his maths-based predictions of currency movements hit upon a problem: global inequality was paralysing the economic future of the entire world. In this podcast, Gary tells hosts Zoe Williams and Luke Cooper why the system has to change. He laments the failure of the Economics discipline to steer a new course and believes we are on the cusp of the total destruction of social mobility in every country in the world.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\nWEBSITE - https://www.wealtheconomics.org\nTWITTER - @garyseconomics\nFACEBOOK - garyseconomics\nINSTAGRAM - garyseconomics\n\n\nGARY'S ARTICLES:\nhttps://www-express-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1310681/coronavirus-crisis-higher-taxes-open-letter-government/amp?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASDYAQE%3D#aoh=15953698215440&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fcomment%2Fexpresscomment%2F1310681%2Fcoronavirus-crisis-higher-taxes-open-letter-government\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/i-made-millions-last-debt-crisis-rich-win-coronavirus-fair-tax?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588851954\nhttps://www.cityam.com/debate-is-there-any-point-in-members-of-the-wealthy-elite-calling-for-higher-taxes-in-response-to-covid-19/\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/following-coronavirus-money-trail/\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/i-made-a-fortune-from-predicting-the-last-crisis-i-fear-for-whats-about-to-unfold/\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/05/22/analysis/whats-making-rich-stupidly-richer?fbclid=IwAR0cV436I5FEzNvpDp2WKqMho5-2rmYJnfef7T6vzYw_pyNy5usoeArTLWg\n\n\nAUDIO FEATURING GARY:  \nhttps://anchor.fm/zuzana4/episodes/Pub-Talks-Tales-from-a-reluctant-Citi-boy-eg74ge\nhttps://youtu.be/RMlfcVUajd0\n\n\nMORE VIDEOS:\nhttps://youtu.be/EiblHqbpXHs - COVID-19 & MONEY\nhttps://youtu.be/RMlfcVUajd0 - RADIO 4 INTERVIEW\nhttps://youtu.be/MHFD7PyEiIg - LBC INTERVIEW\nhttps://youtu.be/3Qlygh4N8nY - talkRADIO INTERVIEW \nhttps://youtu.be/PkMaglDTyJs - LBC INTERVIEW\n\n\nAUDIO FROM:\nPublished with permission from Another Europe\nhttps://www.anothereurope.org/episode-62-i-made-millions-from-the-financial-crisis-trust-me-the-system-is-broken/\n\n\nPHOTOS FROM:\nhttps://pixabay.com/\nby Steve Bidmead & Kai Pilger\nhttps://unsplash.com/\nby Dimitry Anikin & Aron Van De Pol\n\n\nSpoken by Luke Cooper & Zoe Williams\nANOTHER EUROPE\n\n\nSpoken by Gary Stevenson\nGARY'S ECONOMICS\n\n\nEdited by Simran Mohan \nMOHAN MEDIA 2020",
