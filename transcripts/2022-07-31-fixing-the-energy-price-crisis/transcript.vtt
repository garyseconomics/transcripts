00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 align:start position:0%

war in ukraine right the war in ukraine
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.030 align:start position:0%
war in ukraine right the war in ukraine
is<00:02:19.120><c> causing</c><00:02:19.440><c> that</c><00:02:19.599><c> inflation</c><00:02:20.080><c> and</c><00:02:20.239><c> um</c><00:02:20.720><c> yeah</c><00:02:20.959><c> i</c>

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
is causing that inflation and um yeah i
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.790 align:start position:0%
is causing that inflation and um yeah i
think<00:02:21.200><c> it's</c><00:02:22.000><c> really</c><00:02:22.239><c> if</c><00:02:22.319><c> you</c><00:02:22.400><c> think</c><00:02:22.480><c> about</c><00:02:22.720><c> it</c>

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
think it's really if you think about it
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.869 align:start position:0%
think it's really if you think about it
obvious<00:02:23.280><c> like</c><00:02:24.000><c> as</c><00:02:24.160><c> a</c><00:02:24.239><c> whole</c><00:02:24.480><c> it</c><00:02:24.560><c> should</c><00:02:24.720><c> be</c>

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
obvious like as a whole it should be
 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
obvious like as a whole it should be
obvious<00:02:25.200><c> that</c><00:02:25.440><c> that</c><00:02:25.599><c> is</c><00:02:25.680><c> not</c><00:02:25.840><c> the</c><00:02:25.920><c> sole</c><00:02:26.160><c> cause</c>

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
obvious that that is not the sole cause
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.670 align:start position:0%
obvious that that is not the sole cause
for<00:02:26.480><c> the</c><00:02:26.560><c> inflation</c><00:02:27.040><c> because</c><00:02:27.280><c> things</c><00:02:27.520><c> like</c>

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
for the inflation because things like

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's ridiculous right and and then

it's it's ridiculous right and and then

most commonly proposed solution is to to
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.909 align:start position:0%
most commonly proposed solution is to to

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
logic in that right it's like the cost
 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
logic in that right it's like the cost
the<00:05:47.840><c> price</c><00:05:48.080><c> of</c><00:05:48.160><c> energy</c><00:05:48.479><c> has</c><00:05:48.560><c> gone</c><00:05:48.800><c> up</c><00:05:49.280><c> so</c><00:05:49.440><c> we</c>

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
the price of energy has gone up so we
 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.189 align:start position:0%
the price of energy has gone up so we
need<00:05:49.680><c> to</c><00:05:49.759><c> bring</c><00:05:49.919><c> the</c><00:05:50.000><c> price</c><00:05:50.240><c> of</c><00:05:50.320><c> energy</c><00:05:50.639><c> down</c>

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
need to bring the price of energy down
 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
need to bring the price of energy down
so<00:05:51.360><c> what</c><00:05:51.520><c> can</c><00:05:51.680><c> you</c><00:05:51.840><c> bring</c><00:05:51.919><c> the</c><00:05:52.000><c> price</c><00:05:52.160><c> of</c>

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
so what can you bring the price of
 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
so what can you bring the price of

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
energy down and that is like
 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.790 align:start position:0%

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of equal right so we can say
