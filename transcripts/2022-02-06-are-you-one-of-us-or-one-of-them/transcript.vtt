00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.560
yeah this is, one of my friends asked me&nbsp;some 
thing like this as well, when I talk about&nbsp;them,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.600
sometimes I catch myself doing it, talking&nbsp;
about tax, if we don't tax them then&nbsp;the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.520
future is going to be bad for us and our&nbsp;
kids um this is a funny one for me because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.080
you know like um obviously I've spoken in videos&nbsp;
and in the media that I've made a lot of money um

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.800
so some people say that that means
I'm on their side, I'm one of them, um&nbsp;

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.920
but it's a funny one because you know&nbsp;
like I've said in many videos i grew up poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.120
like in the school I was in I was like I was the&nbsp;
poorest kid in the school one of the poorest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.800
kids in school and i was poor up until i was 22&nbsp;
23 when i was started doing this job you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.560
um and I've experienced most of my life it's been&nbsp;
a life being poor and my parents are poor you&nbsp;know

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.440
you know, my brother's doing alright now&nbsp;
my sister struggles to get through sometimes 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.080
and a lot of my friends growing up are still
but then at the same time I've been to work in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.120
the city and you know after i went to study at&nbsp;
Oxford and then you go to these spaces and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.880
they're full of rich people from rich families&nbsp;
and um the truth is I'm, now I'm a rich person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.360
but I'm not from a rich family and I didn't&nbsp;go
to those schools that those kids went to so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.080
when I feel like, who am I? where am I&nbsp;
from? I don't feel like those kids I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.040
studied with at Oxford I don't feel like those&nbsp;
guys that I that I worked with at the bank

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.880
but i do feel like the kids growing up around&nbsp;
here because they're growing up how i grew up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.680
um but at the same time like i totally understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.920
um as an adult i've been lucky to make money at&nbsp;
quite a young age and i don't have the struggles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.320
that some of my friends have of worrying about&nbsp;
like am I going to be able to provide the good

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.320
life for my kids, I don't have those&nbsp;worries so 
I understand that&nbsp;the money that I've made

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.360
in some ways separates&nbsp;me from the people 
I grew up with and the life I&nbsp;grew up with

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.960
but at the same time like that was&nbsp;my life 
that I grew up with you know I mean and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.560
that's the life that still my family lives&nbsp;
and the people I grew up with live so um

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.360
obviously if I wanted to I could have stayed&nbsp;
in the city and I could have made more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.240
more and more money um but the kids now&nbsp;
who are like what I was when I was a kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.960
they would struggle you know like I struggled&nbsp;
and look if I didn't get a few lucky breaks it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.160
wouldn't have worked out for me, I won my job in&nbsp;
a card game you know what I mean, you know I got&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
in a lot of trouble back in school and if things went&nbsp;
the wrong way i could have got a criminal record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.320
and i wouldn't have been able to get in those jobs &nbsp;
um like i got the lucky breaks that enabled me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.560
make it, the truth is nowadays the vast majority&nbsp;
of kids from my background don't have a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.080
um so I know how hard it is to come&nbsp;
from a poor background than most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720
for me what was so important is i had a&nbsp;
chance to make it and i did have a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.040
but increasingly kids don't have a chance&nbsp;
and I worry what my life would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.320
like if I didn't get that chance and what it's&nbsp;
gonna be like for the kids growing up now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.120
and um the fact is if we don't fix things, it's not&nbsp;
really about the rich versus the poor it's about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.160
like the 1% versus the rest of us, because&nbsp;
increasingly more and more and more families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.880
won't have property um and will become&nbsp;poor 
you know more and more people and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.920
I don't want to live in a world where i have&nbsp;to
choose between being normal and being poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.240
you know what i mean or like or where
you have a choice of either being normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.000
or having security, the only way to have security&nbsp;
is to not be normal you know what I mean?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.280
I want to live in a world where lots of people 
have&nbsp;the chance to live a good life you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.920
and it's not a choice between living, the only&nbsp;
way to live a good life is to separate yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.160
from the rest of the people you know what I mean&nbsp;
that's something that I feel deeply like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.480
I can work in the City if I want and I can study&nbsp;
in Oxford if I want but I can only do that by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.760
living a life surrounded by people who are&nbsp;not
normal and who have not lived normal lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.880
you know what I mean and I don't want that I want&nbsp;
to be able to be with normal people but also have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.280
opportunities to make money I don't want to&nbsp;
have to choose between stability and having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.520
to separate myself from the rest of the world &nbsp;
&amp; the people I grew up with so, so yeah I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.640
it's not as simple as us and them like it's not 
like&nbsp;it's not like a battle it's a question of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.880
do we build a society that works for most people&nbsp;
or one that only works for like a tiny minority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.800
and then most people have to live a difficult&nbsp;
life and yeah and I know I want and um

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.840
hopefully the people watching are 
gonna want the same&nbsp;thing yeah

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840
and they're gonna like 
and subscribe innit!

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.000
but poorer families will be forced&nbsp;to lose 
almost all their assets&nbsp;including their home 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.080
we have a tax system which is&nbsp;very efficient 
at taxing ordinary working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.840
but very inefficient at taxing the super rich
