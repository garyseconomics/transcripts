00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome back to Gary's Economics
today&nbsp;we've got a channel update for you

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay so we've had massive growth on the channel in&nbsp;
the last like month or so and um that's fantastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.680
I just wanted to say thank you very much to like&nbsp;
all of the new people who've come, all the new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.120
people who've been commenting, sending messages&nbsp;
um especially people who've like gone back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.800
like watched the old videos like it's really like&nbsp;
this is basically what what we need in order for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.040
me to be able to start pushing change to happen so&nbsp;
like thank you very much to everyone who's come in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640
um I would also like to basically apologise to&nbsp;
all the people who sent me messages that I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.400
not been able to reply to, um, back when this channel&nbsp;
started honestly I used to apply to every message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.520
um but at the moment it's just just not possible
I'm reading the messages and I'm taking them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.280
into account when I decide what to talk about&nbsp;
when I film um so yeah keep sending them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.520
especially people who've been like offering to&nbsp;help
like we would love to get help but at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.480
like it's not really possible for me to even&nbsp;
look through them and figure out what we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840
um but yeah thank you very much and&nbsp;
sorry for the message I'm not replying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.960
um I want to do a channel update basically&nbsp;
because we've been... well a lot of things have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.080
been moving very quickly recently and we've&nbsp;
been doing we've been having to like schedule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.880
emergency shoot days and stuff to make sure&nbsp;
we could for example respond to the budget&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.880
and respond to the cancellation of the budget&nbsp;
things like this um but I'm going away for nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.480
a month for like pretty much all in November so we&nbsp;
are not going to be able to film like live update&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.160
videos like responses to news probably in the next&nbsp;
month um but what are you laughing at the Ducks?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.640
that's right Ducks will pass yeah we're not going&nbsp;
to be able to film live update videos in the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.080
month um but look that's fine the way I see this&nbsp;
channel is primarily it's to get as many people as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.760
possible to understand how important it is that we&nbsp;
fix wealth inequality um listen this is not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.240
to get fixed in the short term um this is going to&nbsp;
be like a long long fight and it's going to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.600
it's going to take some time to do and it's&nbsp;
going to take a lot of people to do it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.400
um we're not going to be able to provide live&nbsp;
news for the next month but I think instead we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.120
going to release a set of like basically like&nbsp;
educational videos to try and help you understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.920
as best as possible why wealth inequality is&nbsp;
so damaging and why fixing wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920
is so important um that can help&nbsp;
you understand that it can help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.400
share it with your friends and your family and&nbsp;
your people you work with so that I think if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720
enough people understood what was happening&nbsp;
then we would get a big move to change it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.800
yeah we're going to try and explain it as clear&nbsp;
as possible in videos over the next few weeks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
um yeah that's gonna help you understand um the&nbsp;
next thing is like I've been getting a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.800
messages from people saying look I really want to&nbsp;
help what can I do what can I do and like I really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.080
appreciate that that's it really means a lot to&nbsp;
see like people passionate and wanting to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.720
um it's been difficult for me basically because&nbsp;
I can't reply to everyone say what you need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.920
um but I think the main thing I want people to&nbsp;
understand is that this is going to take a while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.920
you know this is not going to be quick this is&nbsp;
only going to happen if we build a big movement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520
um so like I will try and build a bit&nbsp;
more of a structure around this so like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.000
I can have more people around them we could do&nbsp;
more things but in the meantime really all I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.360
ask people to do is try your best to understand&nbsp;
the message I'm trying to give which is look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.160
wealth inequality is very very&nbsp;damaging
um it will grow if we&nbsp;don't do anything

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.880
about it and it will make&nbsp;the economy
worse and worse over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.800
um understand things like the 'what is wealth?'&nbsp;
video things like the first video on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.920
'Why Covid-19 makes the Rich Richer' because if you&nbsp;
understand how much inequality has increased in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.760
the last few years and how much the wealth of the&nbsp;
richest has increased you can spread that message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.600
I think if people were aware just how massively&nbsp;
richer the rich have become in the last few years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.680
then it would become obviously politically&nbsp;
unacceptable what's happening now making ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.480
families so much poorer so um understand as much&nbsp;
as you can and spread the message um I think I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.760
trying to do this three-step message at a point&nbsp;
where it was educate yourself, spread the&nbsp;message&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.120
as much as possible and push back and um&nbsp;
I still think that in the long run that is how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.800
we win this you know; understand the importance&nbsp;
of wealth inequality, spread the message to friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.760
family, workmates, community and wherever you&nbsp;
can like push back you know whatever that is

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.360
call up LBC and tell em you're not happy about it, write a
letter to your MP, post it on Facebook, post on Twitter

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.520
um but you know some people are going to disagree&nbsp;
and you know be kind - that's how we win people over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.080
um and trying to understand everyone is in&nbsp;
different situation a lot of people's situations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.480
are difficult um but we're only going to make&nbsp;
things better by building bridges and coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.920
together over this so um yeah try and build up&nbsp;
bridges of community and understanding and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.640
get this idea into people's heads if you don't&nbsp;
fix inequality we don't make this better make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.680
sure people understand this is not about taxing&nbsp;
ordinary working people it's not about taxing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.760
doctors or lawyers or possibly even bankers
this&nbsp;is about going after the super super rich

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.160
who are increasingly owning more &amp; more of our country,&nbsp;
get people to understand that if we don't do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.720
the inequality will get worse and worse and the&nbsp;
economy will get worse and worse um you know these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.600
are simple messages if you don't fix inequality&nbsp;
you will not fix the economy if you don't do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.880
anything about it things will keep getting worse&nbsp;
um educate your friends and family push the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.440
push politicians and um yeah just thanks very&nbsp;
much for your support if we keep it growing then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.160
like I'm hoping down the line we'll be able to&nbsp;
make things happen um yeah hopefully thank you
