00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.480
Today we are going to talk about asset price inflation.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.720
So the main thing I want to explain

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.040
today is the difference

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.680
between asset price inflation

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.360
and goods and services inflation,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.120
which you might call shop price inflation and why it is important.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.280
The first obvious thing to say

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.280
is the rate at which asset price increases

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.000
is not always the same as the rate

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
at which prices in the shops increase.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.920
And in general, in the last 20, 30 years,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.680
there's been a significant trend for assets

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.680
to increase more quickly than

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.720
goods and service prices, and also wages,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.280
which has, of course, made housing less affordable.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.240
The first thing you need to know

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.200
is in the main measures of inflation,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.960
which you will see on the news.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.640
The most well known one is CPI,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.080
consumer price inflation.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.440
But you might also see RPI, retail price inflation.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.920
These measures of inflation

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.920
only look at the prices of goods in the shops,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.680
the regular things that you buy

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.600
and also services, transport,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.280
basically your regular expenditures,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.720
but they do not look at asset prices.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.560
So these measures of inflation

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.760
do not look at asset prices,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
which means that these measures of inflation,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.360
I would argue

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.240
they basically underestimate actual inflation

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.360
because I think house prices and other asset

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.080
prices are a part of inflation.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.400
But these are only looking at prices in the shops

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.160
which are going up more slowly.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.200
So the second thing is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.000
in my opinion,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.440
there is a structural tendency in our economy

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.400
for asset prices to go up more quickly

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.360
than shop prices.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.560
And the reason for this is, in my opinion,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.760
growing inequality.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.400
Now, I have looked at this for a very, very long time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.000
This is actually what I wrote my thesis on at Oxford,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.360
which is on my website if you want to look at it,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.120
I'll put a link in the comments.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.240
The reason for that is very simple.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.960
So ordinary people

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.720
spend almost all of the income

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.000
they receive in their lifetime.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.120
This means that over the course of their life,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.240
everything they receive,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.400
they spend on goods and services.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.040
Rich people act very differently.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.120
They spend the majority of their

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.840
income on buying assets.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.920
The richer you are,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.480
the greater percentage of your income

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.400
you are likely to spend on assets

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.240
and the lower percentage of your income

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.000
you're likely to spend on goods and services.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.040
So as an economy becomes more wealth unequal,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000
what you then have is a greater share of the assets

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.440
and a greater share of the purchasing power

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.680
being held by the rich and the very rich,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.440
and a smaller share of the assets

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.480
and the purchasing power being held by ordinary people.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480
Since ordinary people

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.800
like goods and services and rich people like assets,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920
as the economy becomes more and more equal,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.920
the society as a whole will start to desire more assets

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.280
and desire less goods and services, which means that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.600
asset prices tend to increase

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240
relative to wages over time.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.040
This makes housing increasingly unaffordable

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.080
over time in a way

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.600
that basically tends

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.800
to get often ignored by economists,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.760
because economists focus only on

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.680
shop price inflation, CPI inflation.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.320
So housing just gets more and more unaffordable

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560
and basically nothing gets done about it.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.800
The next thing you need to understand

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.760
is that central banks

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.920
such as the Bank of England here in the UK

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.240
or the Federal Reserve in the US,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.320
they try to keep inflation at a 2% level,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.600
but when they talk about inflation,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
they are only looking at

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.040
shop price inflation, wage inflation.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.080
They are not talking about inflation.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.920
So basically the central bank,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.280
not only is it doing

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.080
nothing to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.760
stop housing from becoming more unaffordable,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.680
in a sense it's exacerbating the problem

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.360
because while they

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.160
almost completely ignore rising

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.360
asset prices, rising house prices,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.240
they are pretty much refusing to allow wages to rise

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.560
more than 2% or 2.5% a year.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.240
So this creates a structural problem.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.120
We have a system

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.880
in which

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.080
it is almost inevitable

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.720
that housing will become more expensive over time

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.600
and we are not allowing wages to rise.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200
So we can kind of see inevitably

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.720
this gap will increase.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.240
But we have a double problem.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.360
So as house prices go up and wages

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.720
don't go up as quickly,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.080
there's only basically two ways to fix this problem.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.440
One is more rapid increases in wages,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.400
which the central banks won't allow,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.680
and one is falls in house prices.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.760
So if you have rapid falls in house prices,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.520
which is what we would need

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.600
to make housing significantly more expensive,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.560
this causes massive problems, essentially.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.120
We see these kinds of collapses.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.760
People buy houses with big mortgages.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.440
So if your house price suddenly collapses,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.160
you are basically immediately bankrupt

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.920
because you've bought a half million

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.560
pound house, you borrowed £450,000.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.760
Now your house is worth only £300.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.920
Your net worth is -150.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.960
So people immediately become bankrupted

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.400
and it can cause massive economic problems.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.480
So basically, we've created an unfixable problem.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.240
We need wages to go up, central bank won’t allow it.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.160
We need house prices to come down.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.480
If house prices come down quickly,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.800
it causes an economic collapse,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720
causes people to be bankrupted.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.240
So the situation is essentially unfixable.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.120
And I think the way that you fix

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.480
it is basically to understand that inflation is not one

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.560
single measure, right?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.520
It's not just simply CPI.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.480
What you have is three different things, essentially.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.840
I think three different main categories of inflation

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.320
you want to look at, which is goods

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.400
and service inflation.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.320
And within that we can divide luxury goods

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.720
and services and essential goods and services,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.800
wage inflation and asset

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.120
inflation like house prices inflation.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.120
Now, the kind of inflation

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.320
that we've had in the last four or five years

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.000
is basically the worst possible kind of inflation.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.800
It's been driven

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.640
primarily by

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.520
goods and services,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.920
especially basic essentials like food and energy.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.200
Wages have lagged behind,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200
which means ordinary people's

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.320
living conditions have fallen,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
and yet houses

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.000
have become extremely more expensive in that period.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.880
So it is the worst possible

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.320
combination of inflation for ordinary people.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.680
But it's probably worth bearing in mind

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.280
that it's a really good combination

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.840
for people who own assets and consume labour.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.400
So if you're a very wealthy person,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.840
you own a load of assets,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.760
you own a lot of natural resources,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.280
and what you do is you consume other people's labour,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.320
then your situation is great

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.440
because the things you own have become more expensive

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.400
and the workers

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
who you might use to do your goods and...

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.040
to do your services have become cheaper.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.760
In a sense, it's a kind of a

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.560
you could describe it as a class warfare

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.360
kind of inflation.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.600
And we've kind of built that into the system

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.000
we have baked into our system

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
a kind of inflation where assets,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.200
which is a measure of the power of the rich, continue

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.720
to become more expensive,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.800
whereas wages,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.880
which is a measure of the power of ordinary people,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.960
are basically not allowed to go up by the central bank.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.400
I think it should be obvious

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.320
the best way to fix

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.240
the housing crisis is to stabilise

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.680
house prices and encourage specifically wage inflation.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.960
Now, there is no other way to make housing affordable.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.080
And I would encourage economists to think about this.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.360
It's the only way to fix it, really.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.000
You need to get wages to go up.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.480
I think the best way to make wages

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.320
go up and house prices not go up

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.920
is to move that spending power back.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.120
Ordinary people buy goods and services.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.240
You as a worker, produce goods and services.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.200
If you get money into the hands of ordinary people,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.560
they will buy the stuff you produce

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.120
and your wages will go up.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.080
If instead we put all the money

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080
in the hands of the rich.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.600
They will buy assets. They will buy your houses.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.960
Housing will become more expensive

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.960
and they will become stronger.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.520
You will become weaker and you will lose your house.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.520
So that's it, basically.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.240
To conclude, there's not just one measure of inflation.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.960
Asset inflation is very important,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.240
the kind of inflation on the news

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.440
only ever looks at goods and services

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.720
and wage inflation is important as well.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.120
Secondly, not all kinds of inflation are bad

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.040
If your wages are going up

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.800
faster than the price of goods and services

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.720
and faster than the price of housing,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.320
your life will get better.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.760
If housing and goods and services

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.280
are going up faster than the price of your wages,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.920
your life will get worse.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.840
I want your life to get better.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.320
So let's ask for higher wages

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.520
and let's not accept the myth

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.960
in the media that if your wages go up, it's bad.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.880
Pretty obviously your wage going up is good,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.240
especially if they're going up faster than house

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.680
prices and goods and services.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.960
And the way to do that

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.960
is to take purchasing power away from the rich,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.560
put it in the hands of ordinary people.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.840
And the way to achieve that is to tax the rich more

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.840
and to tax you and ordinary working people less.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.560
We campaign for that on this channel every week.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.600
Send the video to your friends,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.760
send the video to your Mum.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.840
Thanks for your support. Take care.
