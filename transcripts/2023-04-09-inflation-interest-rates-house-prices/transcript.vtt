00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.380
imagine you gave your house and all&nbsp;
of your assets everything you own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.500
to some rich guy and then you took a massive loan&nbsp;
from him and you gave the money back to him so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
now you're in debt to him he owns everything how&nbsp;
can you not be poor and the answer is: you can't!

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.580
all right so today we're going to do a nice&nbsp;
educational one uh topical about the main issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.520
which people are worried about today that we get&nbsp;
asked about a lot which are inflation, interest&nbsp;rates&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.040
and house prices often viewed I think as&nbsp;
3 separate concerns but they're very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
linked they're very related so I think if we cover&nbsp;
all 3 of these and the way they're related it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.500
can really help people to understand how the&nbsp;
economy works and what's happening now right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
so we're going to start with inflation so the&nbsp;
first thing is we've covered this before but I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.100
go over it quickly I believe and I've said this&nbsp;
many times on the channel, that the inflation was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.740
largely caused by the enormous amount of money&nbsp;
given out by this government and governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.360
all over the world during Covid uh the amounts&nbsp;
are truly enormous Â£700billion in this country&nbsp;(UK)&nbsp;

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.600
which is 14,000 pounds per adult, eight trillion&nbsp;
dollars in the US which is about 30,000 dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.280
per adult huge amounts of money given out&nbsp;that 
amount of money has to end up somewhere ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.620
up in the bank accounts of private individuals&nbsp;
largely wealthier private individuals which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.620
huge huge, nobody is denying this by the way this&nbsp;
is generally accepted, enormous accumulation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.780
cash by richer individuals in the last three&nbsp;
years during Covid which is the reason why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.120
I said in the first video on this channel that&nbsp;when 
we come out of Covid we will probably see a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.900
big jump in inflation because there would have&nbsp;
been this massive cash accumulation with rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.900
individuals okay um that has not generally&nbsp;
been the mainstream media explanation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.300
inflation and they've been generally saying&nbsp;
it's because of sort of an anonymous after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.080
effects of covid which never really explained&nbsp;
in much detail and of course the Ukraine war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm not denying that the war in Ukraine has caused&nbsp;
inflation especially with specifically with energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
that is a part of it as well but I think a big&nbsp;
part of it is this massive cash accumulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.100
during Covid if you give a huge amount of cash&nbsp;
out what you essentially do is you devalue the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.400
currency because most people especially the&nbsp;
rich have huge amount more money, more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.060
going around, they can buy more things, they&nbsp;
can push prices up, prices go up and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.700
we predicted it in advance and it happened! what 
does&nbsp;that mean going forward okay so if I'm right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.160
it was largely caused by this huge amount of money&nbsp;
given out by the government you would expect a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.620
kind of relatively sharp jump in prices and then&nbsp;
for prices to start going up much more slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.260
because the government gave a huge amount of money&nbsp;
out in a short period of time and now they are still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.500
running a deficit higher than pre-covid and&nbsp;that 
is because basically there's been a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.720
increase in poverty since covid because of the&nbsp;
inflation which means the government is now forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.300
to for example subsidise people's energy which has&nbsp;
cost the government, they're forced to provide more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.100
poverty benefits because people are struggling&nbsp;
so the government gave a huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.060
out and now they have to keep giving money up at a&nbsp;
much slower rate so what I would expect to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.580
is a big increase in prices and then for prices&nbsp;
to keep going up but not at this rapid rate so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.200
we've seen the big increase and what I expect&nbsp;
happen now is that prices will will slow down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.680
they will keep going up because the&nbsp;
government is still giving money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.780
but they will not keep going up at the rapid&nbsp;
rate so we will see a big fall in inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.940
um almost certainly it's important that people&nbsp;
understand that a fall in inflation does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.780
mean a fall in prices right, inflation&nbsp;
is the rate of increase in prices so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.980
prices jumped a lot they will keep going&nbsp;
up but that will slow down massively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.800
um inflation will probably fall to something&nbsp;
like six seven percent maybe even lower this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.940
year that is just simply because the&nbsp;
government is not giving so much money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.680
out the government will try and take credit&nbsp;
for that but it's important to remember that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.720
if prices are still going up six seven percent a&nbsp;
year then you know life is still getting harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.300
life is still getting worse for you and the&nbsp;
fall in inflation is really a fall in the rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.480
of decrease of your living standards it's not&nbsp;really 
something for the government to be proud&nbsp;of&nbsp;

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.500
okay so that's inflation covered for now&nbsp;
inflation will probably normalise right &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.280
I think it's because of the huge amount of&nbsp;money 
given out that that rich people still have, um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.480
other people think it's because of other&nbsp;things 
um let's move on to interest rates so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.340
interest rates have risen significantly here&nbsp;in the 
UK they're up to four and a quarter now&nbsp;(4.25%)&nbsp;

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.160
financial markets... first thing to say is financial&nbsp;
markets think that we are nearing the top now they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.240
think that interest rates will probably peak at
something like four and a half maybe four and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.400
three quarters (4.5-4.75%) which means another 
just 1 or&nbsp;2 increases in interest rates this year&nbsp;um&nbsp;

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.840
I suspect that'll probably be right in the short&nbsp;term 
&amp; then interest rates will start to slowly come&nbsp;down&nbsp;

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.100
now there's been a lot of discussion about&nbsp;
interest rates and I want to talk about this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.640
because I think I think the situation is quite&nbsp;
interesting right there's been a lot of criticism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800
especially from the left, people saying what the&nbsp;
hell is the Bank of England doing raising interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.540
rates um and that's understandable because when&nbsp;
the bank raises interest rates your mortgage rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.200
goes up I think a lot of people are seeing massive&nbsp;
increase in their mortgage rates it's causing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.840
lot of problems um it increases the interest&nbsp;that 
the government has to pay on it's government&nbsp;debt&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.200
government debt is massively increased in&nbsp;
the last three years it's very large it's about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.640
100% of GDP I think it's you know something like&nbsp;
30,000 pounds per person it's a lot um they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.520
have to pay a higher interest rate, if you&nbsp;have a 
mortgage you have to pay a higher interest rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.540
um and people are understandably super stressed&nbsp;
about that right and they're turning around to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.260
Bank of England and they're saying 'well why are&nbsp;
you doing this? because you're hurting us you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.600
hurting us you're hurting the economy' and I think&nbsp;
this provides opportunity for a really interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.300
discussion so the first thing to say is from&nbsp;
my perspective the inflation has been caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.980
by the government giving money out that has&nbsp;
ended up with rich people and we discussed this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.360
exactly in the first video on the channel where&nbsp;
we predicted the inflation right where we said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.420
if during covid the government is going&nbsp;
to give 700 billion pounds to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.180
the only way to avoid a crisis in&nbsp;
inflation and inequality because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.400
that cash distribution increases both of those&nbsp;
things, is to take money back from the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.180
through taxation policy you see that's&nbsp;
symmetrical if I give you money then the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.380
to reverse that and avoid the consequences&nbsp;
of that are to then tax money from you okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.800
but that's not what we're doing right what&nbsp;
we're doing is the government has given money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000
out which has ended up with the rich and then&nbsp;
rather than taxing money back from the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.000
the Central Bank the Bank of England is increasing&nbsp;
interest rates and this is because economists&nbsp;when

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.140
they think of inflation they always think of&nbsp;interest 
rates this is what happens in economists&nbsp;minds&nbsp;

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.860
if inflation is too high raise interest&nbsp;rates 
if inflation is too low lower interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.900
these are like the articles of faith of being an&nbsp;
economist they're really connected and they &nbsp;

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.260
tend not to think in terms of fiscal policy&nbsp;
so in economists minds they have these these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.420
ideas of two levers that rule the economy one is&nbsp;
fiscal policy and that is government taxation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.300
expenditure so during covid the government run&nbsp;
a massive deficit that means they spent way more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.580
than they taxed, that is what they would call a&nbsp;
fiscal stimulus, it's pouring money in in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.620
of government spending that's fiscal policy&nbsp;
monetary policies is basically Central Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.120
interest rates it includes quantitative easing
which we've covered before but I think to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.140
things simple let's just talk about interest&nbsp;
rates and that is you lower the interest rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.040
to speed the economy up, you raise the&nbsp;
interest rate to speed the economy down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.800
it's important to recognise that these are two&nbsp;
different things all right and both of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.840
can affect inflation so if the government starts&nbsp;
spending a ton of money and during Covid most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.880
it's printed money that will push inflation up and&nbsp;
if the Central Bank starts slashing interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.080
that will also push inflation up but they're&nbsp;
different things right and I think the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.680
important thing to understand if you take anything&nbsp;
away from this video is that we are clearly using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.480
the wrong policy to fix the inflation because if&nbsp;
we cause the inflation by giving money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.920
then the way to fix it is to take money from the&nbsp;
rich, if we try to fix it by raising interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.640
what does that mean well interest rates&nbsp;
are the money that is paid by borrowers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.840
in the economy to lenders in the economy and&nbsp;
I remember we've covered this on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.460
before that for every borrower there is a lender&nbsp;
for every lender there is a borrower okay it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.020
always perfectly matched you can't borrow money&nbsp;
from nobody, you can't owe money to nobody okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.800
so really when the Central Bank raises interest&nbsp;
rates what they are doing is they are benefiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.440
the lenders, so who are lenders? lenders are people&nbsp;
with large amounts of money who lend money out  

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.280
you know largely it's wealthy individuals you know&nbsp;
sometimes it goes through your bank so if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.420
have a huge amount of cash in the bank, your bank&nbsp;
lends that money to government, your bank lends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.800
that money to mortgage borrowers, if you have a lot&nbsp;
of money in your pension, your pension fund lends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.660
that money to the government, lends that money&nbsp;
to mortgage borrowers right so people with large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:24.900
amounts of cash benefit when interest rates go up&nbsp;
and the people who lose are people who have large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.180
amounts of borrowing which is the government first&nbsp;
and foremost and people with mortgages people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.880
with large mortgages which is largely younger&nbsp;
homeowners &amp; also it doesn't include homeowners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.420
from rich families who don't have to use&nbsp;
mortgages right so when you raise interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.600
often you are benefiting rich people because&nbsp;
they have a lot of cash and your disadvantaging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.660
the government and mortgagees; people who have&nbsp;
mortgages, that is increasing inequality and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.500
not as simple as that right because there are&nbsp;
some poorer people have all of their money in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.980
cash you may feel that they benefit there might&nbsp;
be some rich people have a large amount of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.180
for example I have a large amount of debt as part&nbsp;
of my sort of trading portfolio but in general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.000
when you raise interest rates you're moving money&nbsp;
from borrowers which is mortgage holders&nbsp;and&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.580
the government, to lenders which is rich&nbsp;
individuals especially older rich individuals so

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.640
when the government has given money&nbsp;
out it's caused two things to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:30.600
1. a massive increase in inequality &amp; 2.&nbsp;a decrease 
in the value of the currency which we see as inflation

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:39.600
if it wanted to perfectly&nbsp;offset that then it would tax 
the rich back but&nbsp;for some reason, which as you know

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.580
i'm constantly maddened about, taxing the rich has never 
really&nbsp;been seriously in the discussion here even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.000
we've seen a massive increase in the wealth of the&nbsp;
rich, so instead we've gone for the default which&nbsp;is&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.060
raising interest rates now raising interest&nbsp;rates 
does increase the value of the currency so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.440
the one half of it which is the devaluation of&nbsp;the 
currency you are fighting by raising interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.640
but the other half which was an increase in&nbsp;
inequality, raising interest rates makes that&nbsp;worse&nbsp;

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.400
right because you're forcing borrowers&nbsp;who are 
often not wealthy families, if you're&nbsp;wealthy&nbsp;you

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.360
wouldn't take a mortgage and the&nbsp;government 
which means the taxpayer which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.860
ordinary working people because as we&nbsp;know 
the very wealthy don't pay high rates of tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.980
the taxpayer and mortgage holders have to pay more&nbsp;
money to the cash holders which are the people who've&nbsp;

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:33.540
accumulated huge amounts of cash during Covid, 
which is&nbsp;the rich, so in trying to fix with monetary policy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.120
by the bank of England a problem which was caused&nbsp;
the fiscal or taxation policy by the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.680
you've ended up trying to fix a crisis&nbsp;
of inequality by more inequality so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:53.640
that means that the long run situation for the&nbsp;
economy and for for inequality is extremely bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.420
but it will succeed eventually in bringing&nbsp;
inflation down and this I think is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.320
there'll be people who there will be some people&nbsp;
who won't like me saying this it will be unpopular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.140
with some there's been a lot of criticism from&nbsp;
the left of the central bank for their interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.480
rate policy they're saying you know why are&nbsp;
you raising interest rates it's hurting people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.660
if the bank of England kept interest rates at&nbsp;
zero the pound would have collapsed in currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.220
markets the pound would be worth half of what&nbsp;
it is now we'd be seeing an inflation crisis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.280
I mean it would be very similar to what happened&nbsp;
after the trussonomics disaster in Autumn so 

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.100
I think people who are pointing at the Bank&nbsp;of 
England (BoE) and saying this is your fault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.460
listen I've got no love lost for&nbsp;the 
Bank of England or Andrew Bailey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:41.460
um I think that they have no choice but to&nbsp;do
this, the problem is because the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.920
and the broader economics discussion in the 
media&nbsp;have said nothing about taxing the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.360
which would be the correct way to fix it, the Central&nbsp;
Bank has no option but to raise the interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.280
you know if we I think an interesting thought&nbsp;
experiment is to sit and think what if we reversed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.520
the cash distributions of the last three years&nbsp;
what if we went to every single person in the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.800
10% of the country and said we want Â£140,000 tax&nbsp;
that would be a reversal like that it seems crazy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.080
but that is what we have done in the last 3&nbsp;
years we've distributed Â£140,000 to the richest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.760
5 million people in the country each person&nbsp;
right so if we took that back you would see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.440
a collapse in inflation a massive collapses these&nbsp;
people desperately tried to raise that cash right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:31.800
so the interest rates had to go up because we have&nbsp;
refused to have the discussion about taxing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.840
rich and if you give a ton of money to the rich&nbsp;
inflation will increase if you refuse to take the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.240
money back the only option central banks have&nbsp;
to try and keep inflation is to raise interest&nbsp;rates

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.740
and it will happen but in terms of looking&nbsp;
forward I believe that the inflation will come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.400
down when it safely quickly which means that the&nbsp;
central banks including the Bank of England,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.720
the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) will stop 
raising&nbsp;rates relatively soon um I think that once that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.980
inflation slows down you will start to see how&nbsp;
severe the economic weakness is underneath how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.240
big the increase in poverty is and you'll probably&nbsp;
start seeing in my opinion interest rates start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.420
to fall relatively quickly but that that depends&nbsp;
on whether there's a bit of a balance here right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.880
because because we've seen such a big increase in&nbsp;
poverty it creates creates pressure on governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.820
to do more deficit spending and pump more money in&nbsp;
&amp; if governments are forced to pump more money&nbsp;in&nbsp;

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.540
that could keep inflation higher over the long&nbsp;
term and I think what you're seeing here is kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:36.900
of the death throws of an economy which has given&nbsp;
up on tax taxing the rich so if you cannot tax the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:42.000
rich and the rich have all the assets then you end&nbsp;
up in a situation where whenever there's a crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.200
the rich get a ton of money and you can't get&nbsp;
it back so the only option you have is to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.920
interest rates and that causes more poverty which&nbsp;
means you have to give more money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.100
it's a question basically you're trying to solve&nbsp;
the question of how do you prevent poverty when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.700
you are giving all of the assets to a group&nbsp;
of people that you can get nothing back from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.180
it's almost a question of imagine you gave your&nbsp;
house and all of your assets everything you own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.000
to some rich guy and then you took a massive&nbsp;
loan from him and you gave the money back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.080
him so now you're in debt to him he owns&nbsp;
everything how can you not be poor and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.160
answer is you can't so if you keep trying to&nbsp;
provide living standards without the ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.560
to tax the people who increasingly own everything&nbsp;
it's not possible so you will continue to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.920
this Balancing Act between the government has to&nbsp;
spend a deficit which keeps inflation High but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.780
think what you will see in this country I think&nbsp;
the conservative government has a big political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.700
problem with high interest rates and that takes&nbsp;
us to our next point which is house prices so

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.660
how do you buy a house in a world where&nbsp;
you're poor and the rich have everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.320
the answer is you borrow the money from the&nbsp;
rich and that that's mortgages and mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.420
have been the way that we have squared this&nbsp;
circle for the last 20 years in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.600
which is the conservative government has quite a&nbsp;
political need for people to own property because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.080
private renters and social renters&nbsp;
almost never vote conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.360
um they need house prices to rise because&nbsp;
that's the only reason that older people feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.860
comfortable because the house prices are rising&nbsp;
so they need to keep people owning property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:29.700
but inequality is rising and rising, the middle&nbsp;
class are losing their assets so how do we keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:37.800
ordinary people owning property when inequality is&nbsp;
rising because rising inequality of wealth means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.600
you lose your assets but we need you to lose your&nbsp;
assets but keep your house how is that possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.820
the answer is increasing debt so you can keep your&nbsp;
house and you can just get more and more and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.620
and more in debt to the rich that way you stay a&nbsp;
property owner so you keep voting conservative but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.760
you become poorer and poorer generation after&nbsp;
generation so it's really mortgages and debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.320
I like the magic solution that works for the&nbsp;
government and that has been working for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.600
for the last 15 years quite well politically&nbsp;
because the rich get richer and richer because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.140
you owe them more and more and more money but you&nbsp;
keep your house so everybody's winning the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.220
get richer you get poorer but you keep voting for&nbsp;
them because you're a homeowner and what you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.000
is for asset prices to go up it's really really&nbsp;
good for the conservatives and it's really bad for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:24.780
people in general and this is why higher interest&nbsp;
rates are a disaster for the conservatives because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.680
they need ordinary people to be taking huge&nbsp;
amounts of debt and huge amounts of debt are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.180
not affordable for ordinary people at interest&nbsp;
rates of six seven eight percent which is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.440
a lot of mortgage rates have gone up to right&nbsp;
so they need interest rates to come down they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.840
need interest rates to come down desperately so&nbsp;
I think what they will do and what you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.500
them doing is they will try their best to run as&nbsp;much 
as possible an extreme austerity government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.040
in the next year and a half in a desperate&nbsp;
attempt to bring inflation down quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.400
so that interest rates come down and as soon as&nbsp;
interest rates come down you will start to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.440
those house prices go up because of the thing we&nbsp;
mentioned at the beginning of the video which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.600
that 700 billion pounds which has been given out&nbsp;
by the government the last three years is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.340
sitting in the bank accounts of the rich and this&nbsp;
is the big conflict we have right the rich have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.260
all that money and what would the rich people&nbsp;
do with money they want to buy assets so house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.820
prices want to go up but rich people themselves&nbsp;
don't want to go out and buy a ton of houses right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.500
because buying houses is a hassle you know you&nbsp;
need to manage tenants, super rich people don't

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.800
want to be having to fix poor people's boilers things&nbsp;
like this they don't want to be involved in stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.420
like that so what they normally do is they lend&nbsp;
the money out they lend the money out but suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.540
poor people can't afford to borrow the money&nbsp;
anymore so it's created this it's created this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:52.320
two forces in house prices which is on the&nbsp;
one hand house prices should be going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.280
because the rich have got a ton of money and 
it's&nbsp;important to be clear house prices have

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.360
gone up&nbsp;by about 20% since the beginning of 
Covid, and now&nbsp;they've come down about 3-4%

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:07.500
so that force of the rich having a ton of money&nbsp;
push house prices up but now the mechanism by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.740
which rich people buy houses and I think&nbsp;
this is an interesting thing to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.660
mortgages are in a very real way&nbsp;
the way that rich people buy houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.980
so I've got half a million pounds and&nbsp;
you've got nothing and you want a house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.020
there's two ways I can give you housing I can&nbsp;
buy the house myself and I can rent it to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.080
or I can lend you the half a million pounds you&nbsp;
can buy the house and instead of paying rent you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.480
pay me Interest financially it's very similar&nbsp;
if you think about it in both cases I provide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.560
all of the money for the house to be bought and&nbsp;
in one case you pay me rent and other case you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.140
pay me interest so really mortgages are the way&nbsp;
that the rich buy houses for the poor but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:52.080
channel has become blocked because the poor can 
no&nbsp;longer afford the interest um so I think there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.680
two things that can possibly happen here and the&nbsp;
way it will play out will depend on the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.580
one is in this country I think the government&nbsp;
will do everything they can to bring inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.900
down but that will come at the cost of really&nbsp;
crushing the economy and crushing ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.120
um I think the way they'll hope to survive that&nbsp;
is by making a bit of room to like throw a load&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.900
of money immediately before the election they&nbsp;
will try to bring the interest rates down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:21.060
as soon as interest rates come down then you will&nbsp;
see this flood of money that the rich have again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.420
they continue to push house prices up even though&nbsp;
they've already gone up 20% I think they can go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.240
a lot more if you look at after 2008 house&nbsp;prices 
basically doubled over the next 10-15&nbsp;years&nbsp;

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.700
and I think they can do that again so if&nbsp;the 
interest rates come down then this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.200
will open up again the interesting question&nbsp;
is what if interest rates don't come down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.740
which is what could happen if governments&nbsp;
are forced to keep running big deficits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.280
in that case you'll have the question of how&nbsp;
do the rich people buy their houses when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.920
can't lend the money out and I think what you&nbsp;
will see if that happens is the rich will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.560
buying the houses through corporations and you&nbsp;
will start to see much more corporate landlording&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.480
so I lived in Japan for a long time and I&nbsp;
think increasingly in the US you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.100
rather than the rich lending the pool of money&nbsp;
via mortgages the rich pull their money together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.320
into corporations so there's I think it's is&nbsp;
it BlackRock or is it Blackstone in the U.S&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.660
it's a massive company which owns a huge amount 
of&nbsp;housing, rich people pool their money together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.560
in corporations the corporations buy the houses&nbsp;
and the corporations lend the money out because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.780
it's quite interesting at the moment you're&nbsp;
seeing rents go through the roof at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:36.780
time as house prices go down and the rich are&nbsp;
sitting on a huge pile of cash so it's a it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:42.360
a massive investment opportunity for wealthy&nbsp;
people with cash because rents are super high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.780
and they've got a ton of money and the prices are&nbsp;
cheap so the rich should be buying these houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:56.640
and bringing the rent in but the problem simply&nbsp;
is rich people are you know too lazy to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.600
and buy 10 houses right and it's becoming more&nbsp;
it's it's cumbersome right rich people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:06.060
want to be becoming massive buy-to-let landlords
right so but either way the money is there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.920
and that will force house prices up in the long term&nbsp;
and I think what you're just seeing is the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.680
mortgage channel get blocked in the meantime um&nbsp;
but what you would inevitably see in any case is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.280
the massive gift of cash to the rich will manifest&nbsp;
in increased inequality of real assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.700
either through much higher mortgages which means a&nbsp;
much higher amount of debt from ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.700
to the rich, we've already seen a much higher debt&nbsp;
from the government to the rich and what you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.720
see is increased direct holding of properties&nbsp;
I think it's important to realise when that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.560
mortgage channel gets blocked it provides a massive&nbsp;
opportunity for rich people who can just pay cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:50.400
they don't need a mortgage they can just buy cash&nbsp;
at the cheaper price get in that massive increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.880
rental income rents are going absolutely through&nbsp;
the roof and they can profit from that&nbsp;so every

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.800
single step of the way, Covid management&nbsp;
meaning massive cash transfer from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.740
government to the rich, higher interest rates&nbsp;meaning 
higher debt payments from mortgagees and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.560
government to the rich and falling house prices&nbsp;
at the same time as high mortgage rates means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:19.140
cheaper access to housing if you have the cash,&nbsp;
which only rich people do, every single step of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.700
the way is benefiting the rich and hurting ordinary 
middle class families and there's nothing&nbsp;that&nbsp;

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.360
will prevent this if we don't start&nbsp;discussing 
more seriously taxation of the rich

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.300
so to make clear the predictions&nbsp;
you know inflation will come down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.880
um it will still be positive for a while&nbsp;
interest rates will stop going up and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.560
think they'll probably start coming down&nbsp;
it might take a year or two um house prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.500
they're clearly falling at the moment even though&nbsp;
they're still significantly higher than pre-covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.060
I don't think that will last I think as soon as&nbsp;
interest rates start falling they will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.440
going up and even if they don't you'll just&nbsp;start 
seeing more more Corporate Land lording

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.640
&amp; I know these are pessimistic predictions uh&nbsp;
we get a lot of people saying that these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.700
pessimistic predictions but this is what happens&nbsp;
if you don't text the rich and if you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:11.280
bad outcomes you cannot allow inequality to&nbsp;
get higher and higher so support the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.760
we're always pushing for higher taxation of the&nbsp;
richest and that's you know that's the only&nbsp;way&nbsp;

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.920
we're going to prevent these things I know&nbsp;
that these are not good for ordinary families &nbsp;

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.120
we can't fix it without without improving&nbsp;
taxation policy so let's do that okay thats all
