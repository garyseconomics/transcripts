00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.840
okay so recently i've been thinking about ways&nbsp;
to grow the channel um and i reached out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.720
this organization called Patriotic Millionaires in&nbsp;
the U.S. and asked if they were interested in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.560
message they invited me over to give a speech&nbsp;
in Washington DC it was in the middle of April&nbsp;(2022)&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.800
it went down well, it's hopefully going to give&nbsp;us some 
chance to reach out to some more American&nbsp;viewers&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.160
so here is me talking to the American&nbsp;Press 
and what Patriotic Millionaires in Washington DC

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040
[Applause]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.757
When i was 14 i used to deliver newspapers&nbsp;
for Â£12 a week that's $16/week, when i was 19&nbsp;

00:00:51.757 --> 00:00:56.640
and i was studying maths and economics at the&nbsp;
London School of Economics (LSE) for lunch i used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.880
get these two scotch eggs for 75p ($1) because that was&nbsp;
the only way i could afford to eat lunch every day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.480
when i just turned 25 i made my first million&nbsp;
dollars by betting that the us economy would never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.200
recover from the financial crisis, let me tell&nbsp;
you how i did that, so i grew up in east london&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.760
right next to the skyscrapers of the financial&nbsp;
district and um we used to see em in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.760
background we're playing football in the street&nbsp;
but the kids who played in the street next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.280
those skyscrapers never got jobs inside them and&nbsp;
i know because i worked in one for four years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.840
and people used to say to me that's an&nbsp;
interesting accent where are you from

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.000
the reason i got that job is because i found out&nbsp;
that before the financial crisis Citibank used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.320
to hire one trader a year through a poker style card&nbsp;
game that was basically a maths game i was good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.120
at maths and i was good at games so i entered that&nbsp;
competition and i won and that is how in June 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.680
i became an interest rates trader for Citibank&nbsp;
without knowing anything about financial markets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440
four months later i sat on the trading floor&nbsp;
and i watched the world economy blow up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080
and all the traders and economists said next year&nbsp;
things will get better and one year later when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.040
things hadn't gotten better all the traders and&nbsp;
economists said next year things will get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.720
and one year after that when things still hadn't&nbsp;
gotten better all the traders and economies said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.840
next year things will get better it was&nbsp;
around about then i started to get suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400
you see i was working on the trading floor&nbsp;
and i was surrounded by very wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.360
from elite universities from extremely rich&nbsp;
families from elite private schools but i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.240
didn't come from that kind of background and i was&nbsp;
still living on the streets of east london and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.760
could see a lot of things that they couldn't see i&nbsp;
could see how much people were struggling how they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.200
couldn't afford to buy houses how they couldn't&nbsp;
get good jobs so i could see my friends mums&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.440
selling their houses to support their&nbsp;
kids who would never be able to afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.520
homes of their own so where are those homes&nbsp;
going where are those people's money going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.640
and i was working at the same time in those&nbsp;
skyscrapers and i'd been to those guys luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.000
penthouses and i'd heard about their million dollar&nbsp;
bonus checks so i knew where the money was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.040
so what happens to an economy where all the&nbsp;
money flows to the richest and nothing is left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.360
for the rest well i'll tell you what happens that&nbsp;
economy dies and i'm not just saying that i bet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.080
on that i put a massive bet that the us economy&nbsp;
would never recover from the financial crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.800
and by the end of 2011 a little kid from Ilford,&nbsp;
East London who had just turned 25 years old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.080
was citibank's most profitable trader&nbsp;
in the world and that kid was me and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.920
did that by betting at the U.S economy your&nbsp;
economy would die and you know what they did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.080
they gave me two million dollars and&nbsp;
they said well done mate do it again

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.640
so i quit that job but i didn't stop trading&nbsp;
i went home and i kept betting from my dining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.360
room table every year that your economy&nbsp;
would die and every year i was right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.000
every year i made a ton of money but you&nbsp;
know what i don't want to be right anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.080
and you know why because if your economy dies my&nbsp;
economy dies too and my community my friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.840
my family their future their hopes and dreams they&nbsp;
are dying as well and i don't want that to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.720
but it will happen it's going to happen it's&nbsp;
happening right now my economy is collapsing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.000
because your economy is collapsing and hundreds&nbsp;
of millions of people are not going to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.560
afford homes to have families they don't know&nbsp;
how they're going to feed their kids that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.400
what happens when an economy collapses and it's&nbsp;
happening right now and the only way to stop that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.040
is to reduce inequality and the&nbsp;
only way to make that happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.080
is to actually force rich people to pay their&nbsp;
taxes and the alternative is economic disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.120
and i'm not just saying that i'm betting on it&nbsp;
and you guys had better make sure that this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.840
for once i'm wrong and i really hope&nbsp;
that you do thank you [Applause]

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.680
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.080
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:02.080
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.580
