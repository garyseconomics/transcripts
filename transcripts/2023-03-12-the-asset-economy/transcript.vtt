00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.020
Okay today we're going to introduce a&nbsp;
new concept that is going to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.660
understand the economy of today and the economy&nbsp;
of the future, it is called 'The Asset Economy'

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.940
all right so one of the biggest changes in the&nbsp;
economy in the last 20-30 years has been an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.380
enormous increase in asset prices that is most&nbsp;
visible in house prices but it's important to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
understand that it's actually happened in pretty&nbsp;
much all assets; there's been a massive increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.960
in stock prices, there's been a massive increase&nbsp;
in land prices, there's been a massive increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.240
in the gold price and while I'm filming this in&nbsp;
London there's been a lot of focus in the UK on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.920
London; it's important to realise that increase has&nbsp;
been pretty much International we've seen a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.520
increase in house prices and stock prices all 
over&nbsp;Europe, the U.S, all over the Western World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.800
now this is what I call 'the Asset Economy' the reason 
I call&nbsp;it this is because asset prices have increased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.980
enormously in the last 30 years and wages have&nbsp;
only increased a bit we have moved into a new kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.580
of economy where increasingly the work that you&nbsp;
do is not really that important for determining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.200
how rich you are, increasingly the only thing that&nbsp;
matters is how many assets your family has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.400
I think the best way to explain this is probably 
through&nbsp;giving an example so if you are living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.660
here in London and you make £70-80,000 so you 
know 2-3 times average income so you've got a &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.140
really good job, a really good wage, increasingly it is&nbsp;
almost impossible to buy property without being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.760
able to get some significant help from your family&nbsp;
unless you can get a big cash gift from your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.080
parents or at the very least have a long period of&nbsp;
staying with your parents and not having to pay rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.200
on the flip side if you are from a very wealthy&nbsp;
family what you will see is even if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.380
a pretty average paying job £20-30,000 a lot&nbsp;of 
people from those kinds of families can quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.800
easily buy property because they can get big gifts;&nbsp;
half a million pounds, £600,000 from their family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.580
so what that means is increasingly we're&nbsp;in a 
situation where basically for determining how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.800
rich you are the kind of job you have the kind of&nbsp;
degree you have increasingly doesn't really matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.460
all that really happens all that really matters&nbsp;
is how many assets your family has so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.240
moving away from an economy where your financial&nbsp;
outcomes for you as an individual for your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.660
were primarily determined by your job and your&nbsp;
salary and we've moved towards an economy where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.100
the financial outcomes for individuals are&nbsp;
increasingly overwhelmingly determined by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.280
the amount of assets a family has now in other&nbsp;
videos I've referred to this concept as the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.120
of capitalism what I mean when I say that was my&nbsp;
parents and my grandparents they lived in a world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.220
where really regardless of your background if you&nbsp;
are willing and able to work really hard you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.840
save up some money buy a house if you're willing&nbsp;
to work really really hard you can even get rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.840
increasingly for my generation and for future&nbsp;
generations, that will be impossible, so we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.640
moved away from this kind of capitalistic idea&nbsp;
of meritocracy, work hard get rich, we're moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.840
towards really an economy which is primarily&nbsp;about 
inherited wealth I've called this 'a New Feudalism'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.560
we're moving into an economy which is an&nbsp;asset 
economy you can only be rich if you are born&nbsp;rich&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.860
if you are born poor you will definitely&nbsp;die 
poor, now in my opinion this is the biggest&nbsp;

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.760
economic trend of the last 20-30 years 
it's&nbsp;going to continue so if you want to

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.240
understand the economy of today and the future 
you need to&nbsp;understand the asset economy 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.600
next step; how did we get here? how did 
we move into an asset economy?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600
now this is actually what I wrote my thesis on 
this when I was at Oxford this is actually

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.400
the thing I've looked at most of my time as an&nbsp;
economist so it's something I'm really interested&nbsp;in,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.800
I'm really happy to be able to explain it
the reason that we've moved into an asset

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.000
economy&nbsp;is because of the massive increase 
in wealth&nbsp;inequality in the last&nbsp;Thirty years

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.400
this has happened&nbsp;for a few different reasons 
the three main reasons&nbsp;I would point out is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.160
number one: massive decreases&nbsp;in the 
effective tax rates of the very rich in&nbsp;the 80's&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.940
under the Thatcher government here in&nbsp;the UK 
and the Reagan government in the 80's (*U.S.)

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.260
(No.2*) the increased integration between Western&nbsp;
economies like UK, Europe, US and much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.860
unequal economies like India or particularly China&nbsp;
and thirdly the mismanagement of massive crises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.160
like the 2008 crisis and the covid crisis in such&nbsp;
a way that they led to massive increases in wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.660
for the very rich and that's something I've&nbsp;
talked about a lot on this channel so once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.780
have a massive increase in the wealth of the very&nbsp;
rich what that means is you get a very rich class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.940
that has a huge amount of assets and they have&nbsp;
huge amounts of passive income so we always

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.320
use as our example Rishi Sunak; he's worth about 
£700million to £800 million, he will generate&nbsp;a&nbsp;

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.840
passive income every year of something like 
£20-30 million, very rich people with big passive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.400
incomes they tend to use the vast majority of&nbsp;
those incomes to buy the rest of the assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.920
what that means is all of this money trying&nbsp;
to buy assets, it pushes asset prices up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.840
those super rich buy the assets of the middle&nbsp;
class which makes them even richer which &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.700
pushes asset prices up even more so because 
of&nbsp;the dynamics of this, once the rich get&nbsp;very&nbsp;

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.080
rich they buy more assets which makes them&nbsp;
richer, which means they buy more assets still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.140
what you get is a spiralling nature so the rich will&nbsp;
get richer and over time the middle class will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.000
increasingly lose their assets which means asset&nbsp;
price will go up and up and up, wage will go down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.080
and down if you want to know more about this you&nbsp;
can watch our video how wealth inequality affects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.580
the economy but the primary thing you need&nbsp;
to understand is once the rich get very rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.920
asset prices go up, ordinary families lose their&nbsp;
wealth and this gets worse and worse over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.140
so understanding the asset economy will help you&nbsp;
predict the future because the asset economy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.180
going to be more and more what the future looks&nbsp;
like part three what does the asset economy mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:20.340
for you for your family so I think the number one&nbsp;
consequence of an asset economy is that upward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.500
social mobility becomes almost impossible and the&nbsp;
reason for that is quite obvious right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.740
as asset prices go up and up and up and&nbsp;up and up
much faster than your wages it simply becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.860
impossible to buy assets with your wages and&nbsp;
that means that unless you already have assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.920
you can't get assets now when I say social&nbsp;
mobility is impossible what I mean is it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.040
basically impossible to move upwards in class so&nbsp;
if you look at a very small scale if you consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.500
two people from very poor families if one of them&nbsp;
gets a 30 grand a year job and one of them gets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.120
60 grand a year job that person with a much higher&nbsp;
salary will be able to live a more comfortable&nbsp;life&nbsp;

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.520
but it will not be enough to be able to&nbsp;buy 
assets and move up into a permanently higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.460
asset owning position for them and their 
family in the long run so if we only look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.200
ourselves and people in a very similar situation&nbsp;
to us it looks like a meritocracy but once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.180
start looking at yourself and people born with&nbsp;
higher wealth you realise it becomes impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.400
to move up so upward social mobility basically&nbsp;
ceases to exist and you're already seeing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.920
massively now when I look at the people around&nbsp;
me in my life almost everybody my age is pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.940
much the exact same position in the financial&nbsp;
hierarchy as their parents were and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.720
because the most important thing that matters 
is&nbsp;what assets you inherit from your parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.840
the other side is okay if upwards social mobility&nbsp;is 
impossible what about downward social mobility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.640
well what happens when you have an asset&nbsp;
economy is that asset prices go up and up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.200
up and up, we still do have a decently&nbsp;sized 
property owning middle class in this&nbsp;country&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.520
country it's largely older people and these&nbsp;
older people find themselves in a situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.620
where there is a massive financial incentive&nbsp;
for them to sell their assets because they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.260
sitting on a house that might be worth 500 600&nbsp;
grand, living is becoming more difficult so if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.940
they sell that property they can have a much&nbsp;
more comfortable retirement they can they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.340
it looks like they can support their family in&nbsp;
their living conditions now this reminds me of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.580
um a bible story that I was taught when I was&nbsp;
a young kid um about a guy called Esau who um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.760
he was a very strong guy who was a hunter he was&nbsp;
the eldest son of his family and he was about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.160
get his inheritance; one day he came home very&nbsp;
very hungry really starving and his younger brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.900
I'm not sure his name Jacob maybe said to 
him&nbsp;listen I'll give you this food if you let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.060
take your inheritance and the guy was super&nbsp;
hungry so he gave it away and then you know in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.140
in trade for being able to enjoy the moment he&nbsp;
lost his basically families wealth from from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.240
side of the family and this is the situation that&nbsp;
older people are finding themselves in now they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.520
are seeing prices go up but at the same time their&nbsp;
house prices going up and they're thinking well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.900
that's okay I'm making loads of money on the house&nbsp;
if I sell the house I can live a comfortable life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.620
they of course grew up not in the asset&nbsp;economy 
but in a workers economy and they think well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.780
it's okay because my kids will be able to&nbsp;
work hard and buy properties of their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.520
in reality because we are in an asset economy&nbsp;
now when the older generation of the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.840
class sell their property their kids and their&nbsp;
grandkids will never be able to buy property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.680
again so what you see is as the richer get&nbsp;
richer and richer and richer more and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.120
of the middle class start to drop away as they&nbsp;
sell their assets to the rich and ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.780
inevitably if the rich are buying assets&nbsp;they 
must be getting them from somewhere and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.500
this is because people in the middle class are&nbsp;
dropping off so the way it affects you is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.360
we are moving into a world where if your family&nbsp;
has no assets they will never have assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.060
which means upper social mobility is becoming&nbsp;
impossible but increasingly as the rich get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.500
richer and richer they take the assets of the&nbsp;
middle class which means inevitably my grandkids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.920
and your grandkids (unless you are Rishi Sunak) 
I don't know if you watch my videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.340
your grandkids will be poor so next we're going to&nbsp;
talk about how this looks from the perspective of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.240
the old and the perspective of the young because&nbsp;
I think it looks very very different from both of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.760
those perspectives now older people who in many&nbsp;
cases own property they often look at the asset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.020
economy and they see their house price going up&nbsp;
and up and up and they think happy days you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.900
I'm really rich well done me for being so smart to&nbsp;
buy property I'm doing really really well um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.640
I use that money to to pay for their retirement&nbsp;
and they sell the property and they they live a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.200
good life um and they think it's going to be okay&nbsp;
because they read stories in the newspaper saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.880
listen don't worry as long as your kids pull their&nbsp;
socks up and stop buying avocado toast and stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.220
going to Starbucks things will be fine um I think&nbsp;
it's really important for older people any older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.280
people watching these videos any other people&nbsp;
in your life that you explain to them listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.280
if you sell that property which is the only way&nbsp;
you can actually enjoy the increase in house price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.320
your kids and grandkids will never own property&nbsp;
that is what the asset economy is if you take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.020
long-term look at history you'll see for most of&nbsp;
history people born poor cannot ever buy assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.360
or property if you sell your property now as&nbsp;
we move back into asset economy your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.700
will be poor forever so older people who might&nbsp;
be happy at seeing house prices going up please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.700
consider the consequence of this is poverty 
for&nbsp;your for your family for the rest of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.920
okay so how does it look from the perspective&nbsp;
of the young now this is something that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.100
really want to talk about because I think&nbsp;
it's really important now we still live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.560
with this kind of age this idea in our&nbsp;
society that we live in a meritocracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.200
you know we we believe that if you work hard if&nbsp;
you save up if you study hard you can get rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.920
in reality as we move into the asset economy it&nbsp;
is increasingly difficult approaching impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.840
for anybody born in a poor family to ever&nbsp;
become truly rich in the sense of owning assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.540
I think this creates a very very difficult&nbsp;
situation for the mental health of young people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.020
we're telling young people listen if you don't&nbsp;
make money it's because you're lazy or because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.920
you're dumb if you can't get rich it's because&nbsp;
you're lazy it's because you're dumb and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.920
giving them a situation where if they're born into&nbsp;
the wrong family it is impossible for them to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:26.220
rich and why is it impossible for them to get rich&nbsp;
well the reason is like we've said before even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.240
you're earning a good salary imagine you're&nbsp;
earning 80 grand you have to pay tax on all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.440
of your salary at the top end you're paying above&nbsp;
50% when you include National Insurance you save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.020
up as much as you can after tax and you're able&nbsp;
to save maybe 10-15 grand a year when you go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:46.140
buy a property you are competing with young 
kids&nbsp;from richer families who are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.860
gifts from their parents of 400,500,600 grand cash&nbsp;
that is the equivalent of you saving your after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:02.280
tax income for 50 years even if you are on two or&nbsp;
three times the national average so we are telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.460
young people if you fail it's your fault and we&nbsp;
are making it impossible for them to succeed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.040
I think this is creating in many cases a mental&nbsp;
health crisis for young people so I want to send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.560
the message out here to young people especially on&nbsp;
people from poor or ordinary backgrounds okay if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.560
you are feeling like you are poor and other people&nbsp;
around you are rich that is not your fault you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.500
have been given a system where it is impossible&nbsp;
for people born into poor families to get rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.660
so if you're not happy about that you need to come&nbsp;
and help us change the system you know that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:43.020
what this channel is here for if the system as it&nbsp;
is continues people from poor families will never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.060
be able to escape poverty this is not your fault&nbsp;
this is a system that makes it impossible for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.920
support us and help us change that system now&nbsp;
the very last point which is something I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:59.220
that is super super interesting which is in the&nbsp;
asset economy for very sensible understandable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:05.160
reasons people and families become very very&nbsp;
protective of their assets and that is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.940
if you are a family in an asset economy with no&nbsp;
assets your whole family your descendants forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.780
are consigned to definite poverty so obviously&nbsp;
you want to protect your assets as much as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.340
because you know if you lose those assets then&nbsp;
your family is going to be devastated forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.460
and what that leads to is actually people&nbsp;
doing things which are actually very counter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.060
their interests for example many people&nbsp;
because they are very protective of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.040
own assets will for example oppose things like&nbsp;
a wealth tax which we support on this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.680
and once you understand the asset economy you can&nbsp;
totally understand why they're doing that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.000
sitting there thinking oh my god if I lose these&nbsp;
assets then my family is going to be devastated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.440
so I absolutely have to protect these assets&nbsp;
and in so doing they oppose increasing taxation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.240
on the richest and remember that the wealth of the&nbsp;
richest is growing and growing and growing and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.800
you don't do anything about that it is inevitable&nbsp;
that they will out-compete the middle class for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.200
assets in the long term it's a little bit like&nbsp;
if we're sitting here in this room and there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.060
a there's a massive balloon that is growing and&nbsp;
growing and growing at an accelerating rate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.540
it's starting to squash us all we're taking up&nbsp;
all the oxygen in the room and we're sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.060
here with a little balloon in our pocket saying&nbsp;
we can't do anything that will hurt balloons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.620
you see if you don't do anything about this&nbsp;
massively spiraling growing wealth of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:34.200
very rich remember just Rishi Sunak alone gets&nbsp;
a passive income of 40 million pounds they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.000
inevitably take all the assets in the long term&nbsp;
that means we will lose our middle class and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.340
we will end up as a country which which is&nbsp;
filled with poverty the only way to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.140
the middle class is to keep the wealth of this&nbsp;
country flowing through the country generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.240
after generation if you allow the rich to slowly&nbsp;
accumulate and grow and take all of the wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.120
it is inevitable that ordinary families will lose&nbsp;
theirs in the long term but at the same time I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.840
very understanding of why people want to protect&nbsp;
their wealth and that is why on this channel we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.220
always make it very clear look we're not trying&nbsp;
to tax ordinary working people even if you might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.580
be a doctor a lawyer or heaven forbid a banker&nbsp;
we are out here trying to tax very very wealthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:20.400
families with wealth of 10 100 a billion pounds&nbsp;
super super wealthy families these are the guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.980
who if you don't tax them their wealth will grow&nbsp;
and grow and over the long run they will end up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:31.740
taking the wealth of the middle class so if you&nbsp;
allow the super rich to grow their wealth forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.380
unless you already are super rich you will lose&nbsp;
your wealth in the long run and your kids will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.960
poor the only way to protect working people in&nbsp;
this country including asset owners is to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:49.980
wealth flowing around so listen I would encourage&nbsp;
you even if you do have wealth of your own you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.540
to support greater taxation of the rich and the&nbsp;
super rich if you do not then they will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:00.840
your wealth the only way to protect your wealth&nbsp;
is to stop the super wealthy from taking it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.120
if you allow them to accumulate more and more&nbsp;
wealth without paying any tax it is inevitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:13.440
that they will do that so I hope you enjoyed this&nbsp;
video the asset economy this is a theory which I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.500
have used to help me understand the economy&nbsp;
for a long time I've made a lot of money of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.580
I think most economists don't understand&nbsp;
it if you understand it I think you have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:26.100
really good understanding what's happening most&nbsp;
important thing to understand it will get worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.960
asset prices will go up the rich will get richer&nbsp;
the middle class will become dispossessed and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.980
that includes you you know so I would encourage&nbsp;
you whether you are from a poorer background or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.240
whether you are from a middle class background&nbsp;

happen hopefully you don't want it to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.900

our futures and our families, thank you

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.480
money currently is Flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.740
government with big powers of debt and the rich&nbsp;
with big parts of money there's one other thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.340
they can do with that mass amount of&nbsp;
income they can buy your mom's house

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.840
