00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome
back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.360
Today we're going to talk
about the tax burden.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240
So this is
an economic story

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.200
which comes up a lot

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.240
in the news,
which is the idea

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.320
that at the moment

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.760
the tax burden is at an
all time historic high.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.720
Now, I'm
pretty sure this is

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.520
a basically
a factual truth.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.680
And it's something that

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.120
when it first started
to get mentioned, it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.320
kind of confused me
a little bit.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.920
And I think it will have

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.600
confused a lot of people.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000
The reason it confused me
is because

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.320
we have two things
happening simultaneously,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400
which kind of appear
to be like

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.640
paradoxically impossible,
which is, number one,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.760
you have the tax burden
at an all time high.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.560
And that's true.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.920
You guys will see that,
especially things

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.720
like council tax rising
really significantly.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.720
And at the same time,
we have this situation

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.240
where basically
all government services

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.800
seem to be collapsing
simultaneously.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.520
Everything seems to be
constantly

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.920
in crisis,
NHS is in crisis.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.000
Education is in crisis,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.920
especially things
like local

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.880
services are in crisis.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.800
So how can it be possible
that on the one hand

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.240
taxes are the highest
they've ever been

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880
and on the other hand,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.480
government
services are like

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.040
the worst
they've ever been, or

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560
they've been in decades.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Taxes pay for government

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720
services, so
if taxes are super high,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600
how can government
services be

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.920
super terrible? And

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.160
the reason which is often

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.840
given for this

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.200
and I think it's really

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080
increased the popularity
of the idea,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.520
is basically that
government is corrupt.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.760
Government is corrupt,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.440
so we’re
paying loads of taxes.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.320
Government p*sses
the taxes up the wall.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.800
You know,
let's get rid of taxes,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.520
let's get rid
of government services.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.800
And I think,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.840
you know, there probably
some truth to this.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.560
I think there's probably
always been

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
some degree of government
corruption.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160
Government corruption

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.360
may well be higher now

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.640
than it has been
historically.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.200
If you look at some of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.040
the things that happened
during COVID,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.280
some of the sort of
Conservative Party

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.840
scandals,
it does look like

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.480
corruption is increasing.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.240
But I'm not an expert on

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.120
the levels of government
corruption.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.560
I don't
work in government.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.280
But I've been sitting and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.040
thinking about this
for a while.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.680
I don't think it's enough
to say that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.760
corruption has suddenly
increased massively.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.360
And the more
I thought about this,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.080
the more I realised

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.640
there is another
really obvious factor,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.640
which basically
never gets discussed,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.760
which I want to explain
to you today,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.120
which explains
really well

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.520
basically
why the tax burden

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.480
has increased

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.080
and probably

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.120
will continue to increase

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.560
despite the fact that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.320
government
services are collapsing.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.720
I think the best way
to explain this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.960
is to use an example.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.760
Imagine you own
completely

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.320
your own house.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.680
No mortgage, no rent,
you own your own house.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680
Some of you will be
in that position.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.760
Most of you won't be
in that position.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.720
Now, imagine
you are in that position.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.600
How expensive
will your life be?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.720
Well, for most people,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.600
their housing cost

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840
is their single biggest
expense in their life.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.080
Be that through paying
rent or paying mortgage,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.800
if you own your own house

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.520
outright,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.400
you don't need to pay
rent,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
you don't need
to pay mortgage.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.480
And basically
your costs in life are

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.320
very low compared
to somebody else.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.720
Now, let's imagine

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.520
situation changes
and suddenly

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.320
you lose that house,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.920
you completely lose
that house, and now you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.400
still need to leave,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.320
but you don't own
your house.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.160
Your costs

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.440
will massively increase

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.200
because you have to pay

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.720
rent for a whole house,
or you have to pay

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.640
a mortgage
on a whole house.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.840
So if you own your house,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360
your expenditures in life
are much lower

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.720
than if you don't
own your own house.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.920
Now, keep this example

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.800
in mind
and we're going to start

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.240
thinking
about the government.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.520
So I talk a lot on this

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.640
channel about increases
in inequality of wealth

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
and what I say

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.480
very often is

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.120
that there are two groups
in society

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640
who are losing
their wealth.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.080
That is ordinary
working families

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
like you,
unless you’re very rich

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.560
and the government.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.320
And both of these groups

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.640
have lost their wealth
significantly.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640
Now, of course,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.920
if you're
an ordinary family,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.840
especially if you're
a young person from

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.440
from an ordinary family,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.040
it would be very visible
to you

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.520
that ordinary families
are losing their wealth

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.680
because you'll be
probably

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.760
struggling to buy a home.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.960
Or you may
be in a situation

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.840
where you think

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.680
you can never buy a home
compared

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.040
to older generations,
who could buy property.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.240
But the loss of
government

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.880
wealth is often

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.920
a lot less visible
because we don't,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.880
you know, we are not
the government,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.120
we don't think about what
the government owns.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.000
So I went to a talk
by famous French

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.360
inequality
economist Thomas

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.720
Piketty, of whom
I'm quite a big fan,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.960
a few years ago
when I was at Oxford

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.640
and he showed us a graph

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.240
which I still remember
today,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480
and we're going to
show you that graph now,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.360
which basically shows you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.960
government
wealth holding.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.160
So what you can see
in this graph is that

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.040
all of the countries
in this graph,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.080
the wealth
holding of governments

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480
has decreased
significantly over time.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.840
So that one
line at the top is China.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.560
You won't be surprised,
the Chinese government

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.040
is essentially
a communist country.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.840
The government owns

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.480
a lot of the wealth
in the country.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.560
The other countries on
the graph

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.440
are all
Western countries.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.840
So you've got the USA
on there, UK in there,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.160
Germany, Japan, I think
France is on there.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.200
And the story of the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.760
rest of these countries

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.600
is basically
all the same.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.240
They’ve all the...

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.960
the wealth
holding of the government

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.640
has decreasing
significantly over time.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.000
And I want you to notice
that in the case of both

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.400
the UK and the US,
that number went below

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.680
0% in the early 2010s.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.320
So the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.360
So what that means
is the total wealth of

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.720
the UK government,
the US government and

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.440
basically every other

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.600
Western government
is in a pretty similar

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.360
situation,
is now below zero.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.080
So that means these guys
have debts

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.040
bigger than their assets.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.800
Note that
that graph ends in 2014.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.160
The situation
during COVID

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.280
got significantly worse,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.720
so now these graphs will
drop down significantly

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.120
and what you will see
is significant

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.840
negative wealth holding

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.280
for the British
government,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.240
for the American
government,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.080
basically
every Western government.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.120
Now, I
want you to remember

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.200
the story I told you
about you and your house,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.480
because
Western governments,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.160
including the British
and American governments,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.120
are basically
in this situation.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.120
Back sort of 50
years ago,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.920
Western governments
had a lot of wealth.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.520
They essentially own
their own house.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.680
Now, of course, when we
talk about governments,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.840
it's not just housing.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.720
We're talking about
governments

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.600
owning things like
hospitals, like schools.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000
But of course,
in the case of the UK,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.520
the UK government
did own also

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.480
a significant amount

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.920
of housing back
in the seventies.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.840
Governments have lost
this wealth now.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.360
So governments
are in the same situation

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.080
basically as you would be
if you lost your home.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.040
So governments,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.840
you know, 
they provide, in the West

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
a lot of services,
education, health care.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.680
They used to provide
housing

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.160
for the poorest
people in the countries

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.240
and they
were able to do this

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.560
because they owned
the wealth,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.000
they owned hospitals,
they owned schools,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.400
they owned housing.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.040
And what we learned

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.880
from that Piketty graph
that I showed you

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.880
is that basically Western
governments do not own

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
any wealth anymore.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.760
And the fact that
the number has dropped

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.600
below zero,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.680
means that not only do

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.400
they not own wealth,
they're actually

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.440
in a significant
amount of debt.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.240
So what does that mean?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.720
Governments

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.760
still need to provide you
with health care,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.560
but they don't own
the hospital.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.000
Governments
still need to provide you

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.560
with education,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.480
but they don't own
the school.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.240
Governments
still need to provide

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.040
the poorest people
in society with housing,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.000
but they don't own
the homes.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.840
Now, things like health
care and education

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.560
are never very cheap
to provide anyway.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.600
You need

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.440
to pay for doctors, you
need to pay for teachers.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.880
But they're a

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.840
lot cheaper to provide

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.920
when you own
the buildings.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920
If you don't own
the building,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.800
then you need to pay
rent on the building.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.560
If you have a massive

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.840
amount of debt,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.400
then you need to pay
interest on that debt.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.160
So now governments
are in situations,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.800
just as you are in,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.560
previously they didn't
need to pay that rent,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.160
they didn't need to pay
that debt interest,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.080
and now
they've got to pay it.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.040
What that means is

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.160
if they want
to provide you

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.880
with the same level
of service

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.320
that they used

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.360
to provide you with 30,
40, 50 years ago,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.080
they simply need
more tax money

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.160
because they no longer

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.840
own the assets

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.640
and they need to pay rent
or interest

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.160
on those assets.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.920
So I think this is
a really important thing

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.800
for you to understand,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.520
and it really completely
explains the situation

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.360
that we are in.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.920
The reason
that governments

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.040
are having to charge
much higher levels of tax

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.720
to provide much worse
levels of service

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.200
is quite simply

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.520
because governments are
much, much poorer now.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.680
Governments
are really poor.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.120
And when governments are
rich,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360
they have
what you could call in

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.240
modern lingo
passive income,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:25.480
you know,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.360
they own the property,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.560
they don't need to pay
for the property

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.400
and they can use
those passive incomes

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.120
to provide you
with government services.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.440
Governments are no longer
rich.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.880
Governments
are now very poor.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.040
They need to rent
everything they use,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.400
they need

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.520
to pay interest.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.040
And that means

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.920
they've taken that money
from you.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.440
And despite

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.080
taking more money
from you, they can't

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.960
provide services.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.120
That is what happens
when you go

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.200
from being rich
to being poor.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.000
Now, this wouldn't
necessarily be a problem

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.200
if the assets
which the government

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.400
has lost, the wealth

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.960
which the government
has lost,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.480
were held
by ordinary families.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.800
So, you know, one thing
I want you to realise is

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.920
this loss in government

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920
wealth, you know,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.680
these assets,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.920
these hospitals,
these schools,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.840
they have not
disappeared.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.640
They're all still here.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.080
These assets must
have gone to somebody.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.360
And if those assets had

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.000
gone to ordinary people,
it wouldn't necessarily

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.600
be a problem.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.160
I think the best example
to illustrate

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.320
that is the council
housing, right?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.160
So when council housing
was sold off in sort of

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.240
the ‘80s and the ’90s,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.880
the people who benefited
from that initially

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.040
were the people who lived
in the council houses.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440
Council houses

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.880
were given to poorer
people, so it benefited

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.520
the poor people.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.680
Now the government didn't
have the homes,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.600
but the people who needed

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.400
the housing
owned their own homes.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.320
So it wasn't initially

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.800
a problem

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.240
if it was just
a transfer of wealth

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.520
from the government
to the people,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.080
then it wouldn't
necessarily matter

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.280
because the people
would be richer now.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.440
They could pay more taxes

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.280
or the government
wouldn't

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.960
need to provide
so many services

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.120
because you directly
would own things

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.200
like your own homes.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.640
The problem that we have
is that actually

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.000
in the last,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.520
you know, 30, 40 year

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:03.960
period

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.720
in which you have seen
governments

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.400
have massively
lost their wealth.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.360
We have also seen
a significant

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.640
loss of wealth
in ordinary families.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.920
And I think this is

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
something I talk about
a lot on the channel,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040
but it is most visible
in two things.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.240
Number one,
the massively decreased

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.600
home ownership rates
for young people.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.200
You know, here
in this country

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.880
and in the US,
ordinary families,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.080
their wealth tends
to be in housing.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.960
So if younger people

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.720
are not getting housing,
it's a sign

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.040
that families are losing
their wealth.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.760
And number two,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.880
the massively
increased debt levels

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.640
for ordinary families,
especially families

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.880
who manage
to get a mortgage.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.440
So I think
this creates a kind of

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.400
interesting and
confusing paradox, right.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.320
Which is

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.680
how can it be possible

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.800
that government has lost
its wealth

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.920
and ordinary families
who lost their wealth?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.560
Now the government

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.600
gave, for example,
the council housing

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.360
to ordinary families.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.480
Now you have a situation
where

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.160
both ordinary families
and governments

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.040
are struggling
to get housing.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.120
And I think this reveals

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.840
the core of the problem,
which is something

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.520
I talk about
a lot on this channel,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.760
which is that wealth,
which transferred

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.280
initially
from the government

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.040
to ordinary families,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.600
has over time

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.280
ended up being held
by the very rich.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.640
And you know,
this happens to...

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.200
If you want to understand
the mechanism of this,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.840
you should
watch the video

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.320
we put a couple of weeks

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.640
ago called

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.920
How You Lose Your House,
which is ordinary people

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.520
got this wealth
from the government.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.440
They use that wealth
to support their lives,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.360
to support
their retirements,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.840
to pay
for end of life care.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.120
And they ended up
selling that wealth

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.760
to the rich.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.840
The end situation is

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.320
we end up in a place
where both the government

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.560
and ordinary families
have very little wealth.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.240
Now, this is.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.920
it’s kind of a disastrous
situation, right.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.080
Because we've
already learned

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.720
the government is

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.320
struggling
to provide basic services

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.760
now because
government is poor.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.360
What does it mean if on
top of that, ordinary

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.720
families are poor?

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.960
Well, that means

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.920
ordinary families
can't afford housing,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.240
which means
they really need housing.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.400
But the government
who used to have housing

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.240
doesn't
have housing either,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.200
so they can't provide you
with housing.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
It also means that

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.960
people are living
lives of greater poverty.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.560
They will live in worse
conditions,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.600
they will even worse
housing.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.400
They will eat worse
diets,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.720
they will have more
stress.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.280
They will probably face
more crime,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.960
which means they'll need
more health care.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.120
But the government can't
provide more health care

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.920
because the government
has no assets.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.200
So I think this

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.440
really realises,
makes real the problem

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.640
that I talk about
on this channel.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.040
So people who’ve

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.400
watched for a long time
will know

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.480
I'm very, very worried

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.840
about growing
inequality of wealth.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.320
And I think

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.200
people have become

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.040
used to the idea

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.200
that inequality
is a social problem.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.640
They’re used to, kind
of, people on the left

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.720
arguing that we need less

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.000
inequality
because it's unfair.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.720
It's not good
for society.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.360
My worry is deeper than
that.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.840
My worry
is that when you have

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.400
very high levels
of inequality,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.560
what it means is
you can't get

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.200
basic
essential needs like

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.800
housing and health
care and education.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.000
You know,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.720
in our economy
we have a distribution

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.920
of resources.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.320
If both governments
and ordinary families are

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.400
losing their wealth,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.800
that wealth is
going to the super rich.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.720
And we've seen a ton
of statistics

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.320
which show us that

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.560
the super rich
have enormously

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.680
increased their wealth
in the last three years,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.520
we had the biggest ever
one year rise of wealth

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.680
by superrich in the
first year of COVID.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.960
If we give all of the
resources to the rich,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960
if we bankrupt
both ordinary families

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.520
and the government,
the consequence is

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.840
your family
can't get a house,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.680
your family can't get

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.800
health care,
your family can't get

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.520
education,
and the government

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.480
won't be able
to provide them

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.800
because
they are also poor.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.680
So I think

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.400
once you recognise
that that is the problem,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.080
that governments
have lost their wealth

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.680
and therefore they can't
provide services,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.840
the only option
that they appear to feel

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.640
they have is to tax
the middle class

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.400
who are
also losing their assets.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.240
You realise that

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.640
the fundamental
question here

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.120
and the only real way
to solve this problem

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.720
is to get the assets
back, basically.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.840
And that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.160
increasing
the size of government.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.560
It could mean
transferring assets back

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.760
from the very rich

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.760
to the middle class,
to the working classes.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.840
And the fundamental
question is

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.440
how do you get
those assets back?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.800
And I think if you want
to address that question,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.280
how do you get the assets
back?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.200
It is very helpful
to consider yourself

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.840
from the position
of a wealthy person.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.720
So consider you all like,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.440
a rich person, but
not a super rich person.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.040
So say you've got a net
worth of £5 million,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.680
which is of course
a lot, but the very rich

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.280
have much, much
more than that.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.240
If you have a net worth
of £5 million,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.000
lets assume you’re able

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.600
to make 5% a year on that
£5 million,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.480
you might make a bit
less.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.600
5% of £5 million
is £250,000 a year.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.320
Lets assume you make a bit less. £200,000 a year.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.920
This is passive

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.520
income, you

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.600
get this on
top of your work,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.840
you don't do any work
to get it.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.040
You're making £200,000
a year.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.200
How much money
would you spend?

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.080
Imagine
you suddenly had a

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.760
passive income
of £200,000 a year.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.120
You know,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.360
the ordinary person

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.400
probably spends £20,000
to £30,000 a year.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.840
I suspect you probably
raised your spending

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.000
to £60,000 a year,
maybe £70,000 a year,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.680
which would massively
improve your lifestyle.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.640
And you still have
another £130,000 a year

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.920
passive income,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.160
which you could use
to buy more assets.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.360
Now, in a strong economy
that is growing rapidly,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.280
you might be able to use

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.360
this money
to create more assets.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.840
But we don't live
in a strong economy

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.080
that's growing rapidly,
we haven't for some time.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.280
You're probably going
to use this money to buy

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.240
existing assets,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.080
probably from the middle
class,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.520
probably
from the government.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.520
But the big problem
you have here,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.040
you will never sell
your assets, will you?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.160
If you have £5
million in assets,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.440
you've got £160,000
a year passive income,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.560
which you use to grow
your assets.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.040
You will never,
ever sell your assets.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.240
So if we exist
in an economy

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.600
which is not
really growing,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.600
the rich will never sell
their assets.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.680
Not only that,
they will continue

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.120
to buy more assets.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.920
You can see that
it is already

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.160
and will become
increasingly impossible

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.400
for the government

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.520
or for you
as an ordinary family

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.120
to ever get
any of your assets back.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.000
So, you know, this is
the situation we are in.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.240
Government
is taxing you a lot

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.000
to pay
for sh*tty services

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.560
because
government's bankrupt

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.040
and you can't afford
to pay those taxes

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.120
because ordinary families
are bankrupt

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.280
and all of that wealth

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.480
is gone to the rich
who are going to use it

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.440
to buy
the rest of the wealth,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.280
making
you even more bankrupt.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.680
And this essentially
is the reason why

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.800
what I always campaign

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.960
for is significantly
higher taxes

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.040
on the very rich,
because I don't see

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.720
any other way of you
getting your assets back.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.840
And I want to talk
a little bit

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.640
about how this could
work, how we could make

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.360
this society better.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.520
I think the only way

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.280
you get wealth flowing
in the other direction,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.760
you tax very rich people
much, much more.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.520
You use that money

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.320
to significantly reduce
taxes on working people.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.320
Your taxes are less.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.160
So you start to be able

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.360
to accumulate
a bit of money.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.400
Rich people's
taxes are much, much more

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.240
so they need
to sell their assets

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.680
in order to pay
for the taxes.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.200
You've got more money.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.960
The rich need to sell
assets.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.280
You ordinary working
families can start to buy

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.680
those assets
back from the rich.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680
So the reason I support
higher

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.080
taxation on the rich
is because, number one,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.360
it's the only way
to reduce your taxes.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.080
And number two, it's
the only way for you,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.560
ordinary families,
to get your assets back.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.720
The point
I want to make here is,

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.200
you know,
when I talk about taxes,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.160
we're in an interesting

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.200
place here in society
where,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.840
you know, understandably,
the middle class

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.920
is getting quite heavily
taxed, largely

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.480
because the rich pay
very low taxes.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.160
And if you haven't
watched,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.080
I would encourage
you to watch our video

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.000
Who Pays Tax?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.080
Because
the very rich often pay

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.960
very,
very low rates of tax.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.280
And that has led
to a situation

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.000
where ordinary people

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.120
and particularly
slightly higher earning

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.200
people, middle class
people

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.080
are very opposed to tax.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.000
And yet tax

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.640
is essentially

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.760
the only way that they
will ever get richer.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.600
So ordinary
people have been

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.200
put in a situation
where for very

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.960
understandable reasons,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.440
they oppose
the only possible

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.680
policy measure
which could

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.440
save them from poverty.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.440
And I think, you know,
this is supported

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.400
by ideas
like tax is wasted,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.280
like tax is corrupt,

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.720
like tax goes
to a corrupt government.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.720
Taxing the rich can be
used to lower your taxes

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.840
and that is the only way

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.520
that you can get
your assets

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.720
back from wealthy people.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.480
If we don't tax them,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.200
they will continue
to never sell any assets

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.160
have enormous amounts
of passive income

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.760
which they and their kids
will use to outcompete

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.240
you and your kids
for the assets

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.040
which you currently own
and in the end

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.120
your family will own
nothing.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.840
So listen, tax for me
is...

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.440
it's not about increasing
the size of government.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.200
It's not about more

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.920
levels of government
spending.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.680
Tax for me
is about defending

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.440
ordinary families

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.600
from the growing power
and wealth of the rich.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.320
It's about getting wealth

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.000
back into the
hands of ordinary people,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.760
and it's about making

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.200
life better,
or at the very least

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.320
stopping life
from getting worse.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.040
So to conclude,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.600
I would like to make
the clear point

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.800
that the only way

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.640
to reduce the tax burden

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.720
for you, for ordinary
families like you,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.400
is to increase taxes.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.760
But to increase taxes on
the rich.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.080
We're going to campaign
for it.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.720
We're here every week.
Tell your friends.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.280
Tell your mum. Thank you.
