00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.793
My name's Gary Stevenson.

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:03.336
I'm the author of The Trading Game.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.715
And we are going to talk a little bit
about inflation.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.010
The first thing I want to say is
I was going crazy

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.555
about inflation from the very beginning
of the COVID epidemic.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.058
I wrote articles In March 2020,
I put out my first video

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.478
on my YouTube in June 2020, saying
we were going to have an inflation crisis

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:21.521
after the end of lockdown

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.898
because in my opinion,
it was really obvious

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:27.652
right from the beginning of COVID and I’ll
explain why.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:33.074
We could see very clearly,
very early on that

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.201
there was going
to have to be a long lockdown

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:40.040
and that would be very expensive for the
US government, for the UK government.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:44.044
We knew truly enormous amounts of money
were going to be given out.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.336
Now my background,

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:49.257
which obviously if you read the book, is
as a trader who looks a lot at inequality.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.216
So when I see that

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.219
enormous amounts of money are going to be
given out by the government,

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.846
the US government, UK government,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:58.016
the first question I'm asking is
who's going to end up with that money?

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.143
The total amount of money
given out by the US government

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.438
since the beginning of COVID,
$10 trillion,

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:08.193
which is just under $80,000
for every US taxpayer.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:12.489
What that means is if you are
a US taxpayer and you do not have $80,000

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.993
cash more now than you did four years ago,
someone has your $80,000.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.788
It's very important that you know who
because if you're going to give out

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:20.914
that much money,

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.709
you are going to dramatically transform
your wealth distribution in your country.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.835
I was sort of obsessed

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.630
at the beginning of COVID in understanding
who has the money,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.591
because it's quite hard to understand
where it's gone.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.094
The reason that money was given out
because a lot of people lost their jobs

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.845
during COVID, couldn’t work.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.514
So you might think that it's people
who couldn't

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:41.518
work are suddenly richer in COVID, but
they're not because they lost their jobs.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.604
So if you follow the money one step
further, you can look at the corporations.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.356
Well, they're not paying wages anymore.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.109
Maybe they're richer, but they're not
because they're closed down.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.693
Well, who normally pays corporations?

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:51.736
Well, that's customers.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.696
And this is the correct answer.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.241
The people who accumulated money
during COVID were customers,

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.575
but not all customers, right?

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.495
Because if you're an ordinary family
from a poor background,

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.831
you're still paying your rent,
still paying your mortgage,

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.167
still paying your bills, your expenditure
didn't go down.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.253
What expenditure collapsed during COVID?

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.921
Luxury expenditure.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.589
Who has the highest luxury expenditure?

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.258
Rich people.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.135
So what happened
during COVID was rich people

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.138
stop spending because it was illegal
and the government

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.433
effectively printed money
to pay your salary instead,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.270
which you use to pay your rent
or mortgage.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.272
That went to rich people
and rich people kept it.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.690
Imagine if we brought in a tax

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.360
that took $80,000 from every US taxpayer
and gave it to the rich.

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:33.736
What would you expect to happen?

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.405
Explosion in Inequality.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.157
Living Standards for the rich

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.742
getting much better
and ordinary people getting much poorer.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:44.414
We literally caused inequality to increase
at the fastest rate in the history

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.876
of the country during a time
when the economy was literally closed.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.712
And we were surprised when living
standards collapsed on the reopen.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.047
The most frustrating thing about this
is it's fixable

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:55.967
because we can reverse those inequality
increases by taxing the rich.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:59.846
One thing that I want to make clear
is when I say tax rich people, I'm

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:04.434
not talking about lawyers and doctors
and, heaven forbid, maybe even bankers.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.811
I was a very successful banker
and I earned a lot of money

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:07.812
and I paid a lot of tax.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.690
I was paying over 60%
at the peak of my career.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.985
And at the same time as I did that,
the Duke of Westminster, who is a member

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:17.405
of the British aristocracy,
inherited £10 billion and paid nothing.

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:20.742
Now, what we have in my country
and in your country

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:24.621
are increasingly class based tax systems
where hard working people

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.333
from poor and ordinary backgrounds
work hard and pay a huge amount of tax.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.754
And very, very wealthy
people from very, very wealthy backgrounds

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.548
don't work, make enormous amounts of money
and pay nothing.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:40.261
We need to shift the tax system away
from taxing working people and towards

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.890
taxing these small amounts of individuals
who increasingly own

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.060
everything in our countries
and are driving our families

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.311
and our governments into debt.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.065
It's about shifting tax, in my mind
away from work and towards wealth.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.025
It's the only way to prevent inequality

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.194
getting higher and higher
and living standards from falling.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.821
And I'm not just saying that.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:03:59.822
I'm betting on it.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.491
I've got a long track record
of being right,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.078
and I don't wanna be right on
this one anymore.

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:05.495
Good luck.
