00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Good morning, guys.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Today we're going to do a channel up date for you.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.920
We've got a lot of things happening.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.440
I want to make sure you guys know what's happening.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.360
We're going to have some discount codes for you.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.360
There's going to be some Easter eggs at the end.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.720
Lots to talk about.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.120
The first thing to say is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.320
just thank you basically for

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.520
the reception coming back.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.960
You know, people always tell you when you're doing

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.600
YouTube, never take a break. Never, ever take a break.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.080
Always release weekly videos.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.480
And that stressed me out, to be honest, because

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.640
it's difficult making a video every week.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.200
And I want this to be a big political project

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.880
and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep weekly videos up.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.080
You probably know that we took

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.880
six months off last year

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
and that was mainly to finish writing the book off.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.120
But it was also partly because basically

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.280
sometimes I find making this channel quite stressful

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400
and I needed a break

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.920
and I was worried that you guys might not be here

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.720
when I came back.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.680
But we been getting more views than ever,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.200
so yeah, thank you, everyone who's,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.280
you know, waited for us to come back

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.120
and who still be there, who’s supporting,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.480
who's spreading the message,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.200
sharing the videos to your friends and family.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320
We appreciate that.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.120
Second thing I want to say is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.920
to talk about what's going on with the book.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.960
In the last few weeks,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.840
I've been doing

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.680
an unbelievable amount of book publicity,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.880
which you won't have seen yet

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.960
because it's all being held back

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.080
basically to be released close to the time of release.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.480
The book is coming out 5th of March.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
Everyone is getting very excited.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.120
We've had

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.200
photoshoots with three of the biggest broadsheets

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.920
in the country.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.080
It feels like I've done interview

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.960
for basically every single newspaper in the country.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.360
A lot of radio, a lot of TV.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.160
It's all going to start coming in really quickly now.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.520
So I wanted to talk about it on the channel

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.080
because basically in the next month

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.480
or so you're going to see a lot of me

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.760
on the TV, on the radio, in the newspapers. And

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.680
yeah, I wanted to make sure

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.600
you guys knew first and you were ready

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.520
if you want to keep up with what I'm doing,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.960
we put this out on a lot of channels.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.680
It's difficult

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.880
to post all of our media on a lot of the channel,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.720
so you might want to follow me

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.120
on Twitter @garyseconomics,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.400
and I'm going to post everything as it comes up.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640
We're going to try to keep it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.200
on every channel so you can see what's happening.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.520
But on things like TikTok,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.800
for example it's not easy to post it, so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.880
I don't think I've mentioned it yet,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480
but we've got book deals in, I think so far,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.360
ten different countries, book deals in the UK,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.520
US, Spain, Germany, Netherlands,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.960
Finland, Czech Republic, Japan, China and Taiwan.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.560
So all of those countries,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.200
the book will come out in your local language,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.360
but the English language version

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.080
will be available all over the world.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.160
I have to give a shout out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.400
to my American publishers

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.960
because they have been working

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.880
really hard to make sure

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.000
that we get a discount code for Barnes and Noble.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.640
There've been more

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.280
and more American viewers in the channel recently.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.600
I see you guys in the comments.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.800
I've been on those guys because I know

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.080
we've been putting out the Waterstones

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.760
discount code here in the UK,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.320
but we wanted to say something for the American’s.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.440
So there will be at the time this video comes out,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.520
we'll have the Barnes and Noble discount code

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.560
for American viewers

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.960
and it will be in the description below.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.400
So make sure, if you're American,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.280
thank you for your support. Check it out.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.000
I know some of you are here just for the economics, so

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.280
we appreciate your patience for the book stuff.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.840
But I also know a lot of you are here

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.800
supporting the book.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.720
Listen,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.360
everything is getting very exciting with the book.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.880
I think we've got a really big opportunity

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.200
to reach a huge amount of people,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.160
which is potentially going

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.280
to help us really grow this channel.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.760
So I appreciate everyone who supported the book,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.920
everyone who has preordered the book,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.840
everyone who’s excited about reading the book.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.880
Basically, I want you guys to be along for

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080
what is going to be a pretty big adventure

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.240
the next month or two.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.800
Lots of publicity, lots of media.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.120
Yeah, I want you guys along for the ride

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.520
and I want you to enjoy it.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.120
I think it's going to be a massive opportunity

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.400
to bring this message to way more people.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.840
We might be able to grow the channel

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.440
potentially a lot, touch wood.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.520
And make this channel big enough

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.920
that we can start influencing politicians.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.000
You know, we've got,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400
we've got an election later on this year

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.720
in this country and in America,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.280
and it'd be nice to be in a situation where

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.240
I can start pointing to these guys a little bit

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.240
and tell them where they need to go.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.720
And the book is an opportunity to do that.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.760
So thank you very much for your support.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.360
The discount codes will both be below.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.120
It's coming out UK and US March 5th.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.040
Yeah, come with me man.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.320
I'll be posting all of the media

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.040
and it's going to be an exciting time for me

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.200
and hopefully for you as well.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.280
The next thing which I have to talk about is...

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.680
I don’t really...

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.680
I don't really like doing videos like this, but we hit

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560
100,000 subs a few weeks ago,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.240
so I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.960
who has subbed to us, everyone who's been with us,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.640
especially people

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.520
who've been with us a long time, since day one,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.960
but also the new people as well.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.960
But I also wanted to thank

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.880
Simran Mohan,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.520
who is a friend of mine from high school, who

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.360
you see a lot of me on the channel, it’s a lot

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720
my face, it’s a lot on my name.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.520
But when I started this channel, it was June 2020

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.400
and at that time I was writing articles

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.520
for The Guardian and stuff and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.720
basically I was getting pissed off

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.000
because I knew that,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.120
you know, most of the people who are getting hurt

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.160
are ordinary people who,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.000
you know, might not read The Guardian.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.560
And I wanted to find a way to speak to,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.800
you know, ordinary families

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.520
who are having their financial lives devastated.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.800
And I really wanted to start a YouTube

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.280
and I was chatting about it on my

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.920
WhatsApp with my school friends

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.440
and a friend of mine named Simran Mohan,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.720
who is a dentist,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.520
reached out and said, look, I’ve got a camera,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.640
let's just start shooting.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.280
And

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.440
we shot videos together

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.520
for absolutely no money for a year and a half

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.320
and for very, very,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.120
very little money for a year after that.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.520
And he shot all the videos, he edited all the videos,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.880
and we wouldn't be here without him.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.520
And I know it's me on the camera and it's me, you see,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.560
But in terms of hours,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.760
it's him who put in a lot of the work.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.880
So I wanted to give a shout out to him

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.080
to recognise 100,000 *subs

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.480
and also a shout out to all of you.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.040
So thank you Simran, and thank you all

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.720
you guys as well.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.760
Okay, I've got a couple of Easter eggs here,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.360
so I wanted to answer a couple

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.800
of the most ridiculous questions

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.760
that we keep getting off on the channel,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.560
which I don't normally answer in the comments.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.600
Number one is, why do you wear that stupid hat

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.800
and those stupid gloves?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.080
The answer is because it's winter and it's cold,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.280
including sometimes in my house.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.160
Number two is why do you speak in that stupid voice?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.520
The answer is because I grew up in a stupid place

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.520
where everybody speaks in this stupid voice.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.760
Those are the two Easter eggs.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.360
Oh last thing is, yeah, I've got my...

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.720
I've shown the book on the channel before, but

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.480
that was a fake book with a fake graphic

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.840
because they hadn’t actually been printed yet.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.440
So I've just received from Penguin,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.800
hot off the press, the actual books.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.720
So we're going to do an unboxing here.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.840
We're doing all the tricks today. Here you go.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.920
Here you go, this is the real thing.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.440
This is it.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.440
I don't know what to say, man.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.400
Read it. You’ll like it. The last thing to say is

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.480
I know it's been a difficult time for a lot of people

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.880
and it's going to keep being difficult.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.840
And I'm always aware when I make these videos

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840
that I'm not

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.000
the person who's struggling

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.680
to put the heat on and I'm not the person

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.120
struggling to feed my family

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.040
or struggling to pay the bills, but

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.320
I'm working my tits off out here.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.280
I know you haven't seen all the publicity I'm doing,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.280
but I'm working eight days a week.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.440
This is a massive opportunity to grow the channel.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.240
I'm working as hard as I can.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.880
I really appreciate all the support.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.720
I hope people support the book because

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.440
I think that's our chance

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.560
to take it to the next level.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.040
Stay there for each other.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.880
It's going to be tough times ahead, but

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.000
as much as I can, I'll be out here making videos, so

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.840
thank you for your support.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.160
And yeah, let's get to a million. Thank you.
