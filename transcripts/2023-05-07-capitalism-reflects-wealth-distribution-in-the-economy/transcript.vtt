00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.660
well I've been thinking for a while&nbsp;
we need to do one about Capitalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.480
because we get asked it a lot&nbsp;right 
"Capitalism is the problem!"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.920
it's a bit frustrating for me because it's like&nbsp;
it's so non-specific it's like okay well... yes...

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.800
problem with capitalism is different people have&nbsp;
very very different ideas of what the word means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
all right um so it can become difficult to do&nbsp;
any sort of analysis of it because different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.480
people have different ideas um so I'm going&nbsp;
to say provide the basic working definition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
which some people disagree with but it's what I'm&nbsp;
going to use for this purpose of this discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.900
which is capitalism is a system which has&nbsp;
a relatively small government relatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.340
low taxation people are expected to take&nbsp;
care of themselves with their own money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.140
um yeah and then there's freedom to trade&nbsp;
freedom to own things basically it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.580
people call it 'laissez-faire' system there's&nbsp;
not a lot of government control people do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.420
whatever they want everybody's free to do&nbsp;
what they want it's important to realise once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.400
you use that definition none of us live in fully&nbsp;
capitalist countries right the UK has NHS that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
not capitalist institution the UK has public fund&nbsp;
education that's not capitalist you know so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
not about living a perfect capitalist system but&nbsp;
let's talk about capitalism which is the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.560
freedom to own freedom to trade and also&nbsp;
means freedom to generate inequality right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.720
now there's something which is good about&nbsp;
capitalism which is that capitalism rewards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.080
people for doing things that other people want so&nbsp;
if you can if you're making a lot of paintings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
nobody wants them you're going to make no money&nbsp;
but if you're making a lot of paintings that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.040
people want then you are going to make money right&nbsp;
why'd the footballers make money in the capitalist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.100
system because tons of people are willing to pay&nbsp;
to watch them so in a sense capitalism is good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
because it incentivises all these people&nbsp;to play 
football and people want to watch&nbsp;football

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.060
these kind of things right so there's&nbsp;like a 
philosophical idea behind it which is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.300
because everybody is free then you will get&nbsp;
rewarded if you do things other people want which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.260
means in theory people should start doing things&nbsp;
that other people want which is good because we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.960
all helping each other out this is the this is&nbsp;
this is the idea behind it right the problem is

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.700
if you actually look at the outcomes of capitalism&nbsp;
lots of people have things which they really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.940
really want or even need that they don't get so we&nbsp;
have a capitalist system and a lot of people can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.660
afford to feed their kids all right so you know&nbsp;
they want to feed their kids and there's enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
food for them to feed their kids, well you know, why&nbsp;
are they not feeding their kids? we have people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
work at jobs for homeless you know of course&nbsp;
they want homes but they're not getting homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.400
and what this reveals is there's one key flaw of&nbsp;
capitalism which is that capitalism doesn't reward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.280
you for doing what people want, capitalism rewards&nbsp;
you for doing what people with money want right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.580
you know there are people in poor countries&nbsp;
in the world that are blind and they just need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.900
relatively inexpensive surgery to fix their&nbsp;
blindness but they don't get that because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.580
they've got no ****ing money right, capitalism&nbsp;
doesn't give back to those people you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.260
you know you know you're a dentist right you&nbsp;
will see there are dentists that spend all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.180
of their days doing expensive cosmetic&nbsp;
surgeries for wealthy people and at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.440
same time there's people who are in agony&nbsp;
of toothache who can't get a dentist right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.940
and this is because capitalism doesn't reward you&nbsp;
for doing what people want capitalism rewards you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.260
for doing what people with money want, if you&nbsp;
can do something that rich people want you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.420
make a ton of money right but if you can do you&nbsp;
know if you want to provide dental work for like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.800
poor people in Africa or in Southeast Asia you're&nbsp;
not going to make no money for that because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.360
don't have any money right so once you understand&nbsp;
this then what you see is inequality is absolute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.140
cancer at the philosophical root of capitalism&nbsp;
because if you have a broader equal society then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.820
it works right because everybody has money so 
you&nbsp;should do the thing which lots of people want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.580
but once you have inequality then it doesn't&nbsp;
matter if 99% of people hate something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.180
you know if you do a job which sucks wealth&nbsp;
out of the poorest 99% and gives it to the 1%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.240
you can get paid a ****ing ton of money for that,&nbsp;I 
know because I did it right! capitalism works for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.840
people with money there's this phrase right&nbsp;which 
is "Freedom for the Heron is Death to the&nbsp;Fishes"&nbsp;

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.340
right if you allow everybody freedom and&nbsp;what 
the most powerful wants is to, what the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.960
powerful people want is to take everything from&nbsp;
everyone else then that's that's freedom right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.380
that is freedom the problem is capitalism&nbsp;
is great when you have a broad distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400
and even then it's not necessarily great&nbsp;
right if you look at for example the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.860
the US is a very capitalistic economy for a long&nbsp;
period of time right and it has a lot of resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.600
so it did provide a great standard of living 
for&nbsp;a lot of people, not if you're black right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.840
if there's groups of people that don't have any&nbsp;
wealth, then they will not get well served under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.140
capitalism and then if you make it really unequal&nbsp;
then that can be 90-95% of people that don't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.680
served under capitalism you see what I'm saying&nbsp;
so capitalism works philosophically &amp; theoretically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.300
when everybody has money, when everybody has&nbsp;
wealth, but we're moving towards the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.260
that is why capitalism works relatively well&nbsp;
in Western Europe and did for the last 70 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.420
because lots of people have wealth so everybody...&nbsp;
capitalism is democracy but one pound = one vote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.300
you see what I'm saying so if everybody has an&nbsp;
equal amount of money then everybody will get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.860
decent amount of what they want, but once you 
move&nbsp;towards extreme inequality then capitalism &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.780
will only serve the rich of course it will why would&nbsp;
capitalism give you anything if you have nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.580
to offer for it? it's about freedom of trade&nbsp;
and if these people have all the power then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.800
they will get all the stuff and what you start&nbsp;
to see is capitalism is so dynamic it creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.840
the physical infrastructure to perfectly mirror&nbsp;
the distribution of wealth because capitalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.360
serves the people with wealth so if you have&nbsp;
a broad wealth holding society then capitalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.440
will produce lots of middle-class houses and
middle class cars and middle class appliances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.920
and middle class services and middle class theatres&nbsp;
and middle class cinemas right but if you have ex..&nbsp;

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.840
an economy where all of the world is with the very&nbsp;
rich then capitalism will give you extreme luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.920
and poverty it will give you a extremely wealthy&nbsp;town 
centre surrounded by impoverished slums which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.940
is what the case in Mumbai, which is the case in&nbsp;
Johannesburg, the case in Sao Paulo, is the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.020
in every unequal country in the world and is&nbsp;
becoming the case here in London as well right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.920
so the way I see capitalism (sorry I've&nbsp;
hit my mic) the way I see my capitalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.860
the way I see capitalism is it produces&nbsp;
good outcomes when everybody has wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.400
when you are in a very unequal Society&nbsp;
It generally produces terrible outcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.580
so you need to protect the wealth distribution&nbsp;
you need to protect the wealth distribution and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.440
the problem you have is that capitalism tends&nbsp;
to destroy the wealth distribution so I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.980
saying I'm anti-capitalist that to me I think you&nbsp;
bring me a car and the car's not working I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.840
going to tell you I'm anti-cars you know I I have&nbsp;
studied this system it is broken in a specific way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.320
that I think is fixable I know there will be&nbsp;people 
out there saying 'ah no capitalism is&nbsp;broken'&nbsp;

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.820
you need to destroy everything to bring it&nbsp;in 
okay that's fine show me the blueprint for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.680
new society I'll have a look at the moment I do
want to prevent this disaster from happening and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.880
it's the problem that they have right now is what&nbsp;
is most frustrating is the problem is so fixable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.080
the problem is so fixable, it is a problem with the&nbsp;
wealth distribution we fix the world distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.700
we fix the problem we can see a massive increase&nbsp;
in living standards a massive increase in living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.360
standards you don't fix the wealth distribution&nbsp;
you won't fix the living standard so for me

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.380
you need to protect the distribution&nbsp;
the system and we're not doing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.340
um and you know like if people want to have a&nbsp;
discussion about what is the ideal system you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.140
know is capitalism the best system could we have&nbsp;
other systems we can have that discussion but at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.960
the moment the system that we have is falling&nbsp;
off of a cliff and I would prefer to prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.540
that disaster from happening first because if&nbsp;we 
don't do anything about what's happening now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:35.100
it's going to be real real bad, it's going to be&nbsp;real 
real bad and um I there's this phrase you&nbsp;know&nbsp;

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.940
'don't let the perfect be the enemy of the&nbsp;good' 
you know we're in a situation but I would say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.260
don't let the perfect be the enemy of preventing&nbsp;the 
collapse of society at this point cos that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.080
we're looking at, that's what we're looking at, 
so&nbsp;listen let's let's fix the problem that we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.500
and then we can talk about is there a better way&nbsp;
to do this is there a better way to do this but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.080
listen I'm not, I'm not a philosopher you know&nbsp;um
I just don't want things to be really really&nbsp;**** 

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.400
and they're gonna be and we can&nbsp;stop them 
If we fix the distribution

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.620
housing could be so much more affordable, wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.820
many more options in how we live our lives 
some&nbsp;of them put a lot of money into paying&nbsp;

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.440
economists and think thanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
