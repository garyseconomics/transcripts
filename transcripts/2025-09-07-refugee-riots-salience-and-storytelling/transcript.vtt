these correct predictions is simply
 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.710 align:start position:0%
these correct predictions is simply

But the way that they succeed is that
 

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
But the way that they succeed is that
there<00:20:04.000><c> is</c><00:20:04.160><c> simply</c><00:20:04.559><c> an</c><00:20:04.799><c> enormous</c><00:20:05.520><c> amount</c><00:20:05.840><c> of</c>

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
them. And I think what this shows is in

throw things out there. And that is
 

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
throw things out there. And that is
basically<00:20:32.640><c> because</c><00:20:33.520><c> people</c><00:20:33.760><c> are</c><00:20:34.000><c> online</c>

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
we win the future. But I think more than
 

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.590 align:start position:0%
we win the future. But I think more than
that,<00:30:02.320><c> it's</c><00:30:02.559><c> about</c><00:30:02.799><c> whether</c><00:30:03.039><c> we're</c><00:30:03.279><c> able</c><00:30:03.520><c> to</c>

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
that, it's about whether we're able to
 

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
that, it's about whether we're able to
view<00:30:03.840><c> each</c><00:30:04.080><c> other</c><00:30:04.720><c> as</c><00:30:05.120><c> people</c><00:30:05.520><c> and</c><00:30:05.760><c> with</c>

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
view each other as people and with
 

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.950 align:start position:0%
view each other as people and with
compassion.<00:30:06.640><c> Um</c><00:30:08.000><c> because</c><00:30:08.320><c> if</c><00:30:08.480><c> we</c><00:30:08.640><c> can</c><00:30:08.799><c> do</c>

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
compassion. Um because if we can do
 

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
compassion. Um because if we can do
that,<00:30:09.279><c> then</c><00:30:09.520><c> we</c><00:30:09.679><c> can</c><00:30:09.840><c> come</c><00:30:10.000><c> together</c><00:30:10.480><c> and</c><00:30:10.720><c> if</c>

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
that, then we can come together and if
 

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
that, then we can come together and if
we<00:30:10.960><c> can</c><00:30:11.120><c> come</c><00:30:11.279><c> together,</c><00:30:11.840><c> we</c><00:30:12.080><c> can</c><00:30:12.159><c> win.</c><00:30:13.279><c> So</c>

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can come together, we can win. So
 

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
we can come together, we can win. So
that's<00:30:13.679><c> the</c><00:30:13.840><c> end.</c><00:30:14.880><c> Good</c><00:30:15.120><c> luck.</c><00:30:15.440><c> Thank</c><00:30:15.600><c> you.</c>
