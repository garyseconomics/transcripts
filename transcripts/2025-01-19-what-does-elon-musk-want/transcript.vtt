00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.560
Today we are going to talk about Elon Musk.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.920
Okay.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.560
So for those of you who don't know,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.720
Elon Musk is the world's richest man.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.400
And he is the owner of Twitter and Tesla.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.640
And he has recently made his big entrance

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.400
to politics supporting Donald Trump aggressively.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.360
Donald Trump, of course, won the election.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.840
It looks like he will give Elon

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240
Musk an official role in the US government,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.720
and he has started intervening

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
quite aggressively in politics and a lot of countries,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.280
including here in the UK, but also all across Europe,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.680
generally supporting the anti-immigrant,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.960
far right, right wing parties.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.000
And we're going to talk today

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.320
about what we can learn from that, from this,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.080
this movement of Elon Musk into politics.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.520
So I think the first thing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.040
which we can learn about this maneuver

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.960
from Elon Musk is,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.440
I think it's a really good

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.920
demonstration of something

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.160
which I've been trying to educate,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400
trying to illustrate a lot on this channel,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.560
which is that when the super rich

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.080
get really, really rich, that doesn't not affect you.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.200
It has an impact on you.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.240
On this channel, we talk a lot about the need to tax

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.360
the rich more in order to protect living standards.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.840
And we often get the pushback,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.360
that's the politics of envy.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.320
You shouldn't tax the rich.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.680
It doesn't matter if rich people get rich.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.080
We should focus on getting rich ourselves.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600
The rich being rich doesn't affect us.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.280
And this is a really good example of why

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.520
the rich being super rich does affect you.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120
The rich get richer and richer and richer

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640
and ordinary people owning fewer and fewer assets.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.600
That affects you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
because the rich are competing for the same resources

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.360
that you need.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.800
There's only a certain amount of things

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.440
in the economy,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.600
only certain amount of housing,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.440
only a certain amount of education, universities,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.400
doctors, dentists, physical space in the cities.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
As the rich get aggressively richer,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.240
they start to consume more stuff.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.760
And that means less stuff for you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.120
and the way that you normally see that is, for example,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.400
housing in the cities gets more expensive.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.760
That's because the rich are consuming more.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.480
The rich are richer,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.680
they can pay more, they push the prices up.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.040
But it's not just housing. right.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.440
It's the same with, for example,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.160
university education, access

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.840
to doctors, access to dentists,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.200
access to space in the cities.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
You know, you see here in London,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.240
we see a lot of pubs closing down.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.720
They're being replaced by generally housing.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.040
Whereas if you go into the center of the city,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.840
luxury hotels, luxury restaurants, theaters,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.600
they're booming. They're doing better than ever.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600
What you're seeing here

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.960
is the rich competing with you for space,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.040
out competing with you.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.280
And the result is you get less space.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.320
And the way that you see that is generally

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.520
the prices of things that you buy are going up.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.280
And I think with this Elon Musk case,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.120
we start to see another example of this,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.920
which is the rich are also competing with you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.800
for essentially the ownership of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.440
your politics, your politicians and your media.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.800
And this has always been the case.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.240
It's the case also for economists.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.400
So I studied economics

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.680
when I was a teenager

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.880
at the London School of Economics, which was...

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.400
which still is a big elite university here in London.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.040
And I got very good grades there.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.760
And I had a choice when I went to graduate.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.040
Who do you want to work for?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.800
Do I want to work for the government?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.000
Trying to help the economy?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.200
Trying to support the economy for ordinary people,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.080
getting paid 40, 50, 60 grand a year?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840
Or do I want to work

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.160
managing the money of the rich,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.240
getting paid 1 or 2 million pounds a year?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.040
And it's not just bankers, right?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.400
It's the same for dentists. It's the same for doctors.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.560
I went to a grammar school

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.680
and a lot of my friends are dentists

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.200
and they can work in the NHS,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.600
or they can do botox to rich people,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.160
and they can get paid 3 or 4 times as much, right.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.200
But it's also the same for politicians.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
And I'm always reminded of David Cameron.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.600
So I think the Prime Minister of the UK gets paid

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.720
something like £150,000 a year.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.600
I think that's the salary.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.560
David Cameron after he left office,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.160
he went to work for a finance company called Greensill.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.520
And I think within the first year

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.920
he made something like £10 million.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.240
Now I want you to ask yourself,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.720
why does a finance company

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160
pay David Cameron £10 million

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.720
one year after he leaves office?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.800
Is David Cameron an excellent trader?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.480
Is he an excellent financial analyst?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480
If your politicians are getting paid

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.320
100 grand a year, 150 grand a year by the people,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.880
and they can also get paid £10 million a year

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.640
to work for the rich.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.320
Who do you think the politicians really work for?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.240
I'm also reminded of Rishi Sunak Right.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.960
Rishi Sunak is a really interesting example

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.520
because his father in law

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.000
is one of the richest people in the entire world.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760
He's a billionaire, so he's...

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.840
the money which Rishi Sunak gets to be prime

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.480
minister is absolutely, totally irrelevant to him.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.240
But the money that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.600
his family will get from his father in law,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.520
that is

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.560
clearly enormously his major financial interest. Right.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.200
So

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.000
you’ve got to ask yourself then, when somebody like

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.640
Rishi Sunak is deciding things like,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.200
how should we set tax policy?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.880
How should we tax rich people?

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.480
Do you think he speaks to his father in law?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.760
When David Cameron knows that

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.680
when he leaves office, he's going to work for Greensill

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.760
and get paid £10 million in one year,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.520
when he's making these decisions,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.880
do you think he speaks to the guys at Greensill

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.440
who are going to pay him £10 million?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.400
So in the case of doctors, dentists, universities,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.880
but also economists, also politicians,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.240
you are in a competition.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.600
The politicians can make a certain amount of money

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.920
working for you,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.680
and they can make a certain amount of money

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.960
working for the rich.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.360
And when the rich are super, super, super, super rich

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.280
and your average taxpayer is increasingly poor,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.960
it gets harder and harder and harder

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.720
for you to compete with them.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.760
And I think this is the reason why we saw

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.400
for long, long periods of time,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.480
really high amounts of corruption in poor countries

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.040
because the local people of those countries

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.400
can't afford to pay their politicians very much,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.160
whereas extremely wealthy people in other countries

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.000
can pay these politicians enormous amounts

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.600
to basically give the resources of those countries

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120
to these wealthy people.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.880
And I think this thing which has been happening

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.200
in poor countries for a long time, you know,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800
if you speak to people from

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.280
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.200
a lot of places in Asia, that they've been seeing

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.720
this kind of corruption for a long time, in the West

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.360
we've been relatively protected

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.200
by that for a reasonable amount of time,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.960
because we've had a wealthy taxpayer,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.800
and we haven't had these super wealthy

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.600
foreign billionaires who can influence our politics.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.560
As inequality has increased,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.440
the taxpayer, ordinary families have become poorer,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.200
the superrich have become richer,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.560
and you have basically found yourself

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.000
in the same situation

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.600
that Latin Americans

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.040
and Africans have been in for a long period of time.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.280
You cannot compete anymore

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.920
for ownership of your politicians

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.560
with the super rich,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
and I think this is a classic example

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.560
of why inequality matters for you.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.400
Because if you allow the super rich to get even richer

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.640
and you allow the middle class

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.840
to lose their assets,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.520
they will increasingly outcompete

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.680
you for the things that you need.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.000
And that includes your politicians

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.720
and includes your media as well,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.480
it includes your media as well.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.760
Now, if we consider the media,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.200
if you work as a journalist,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.000
you need to be paid.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.080
Most people need to be paid.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.760
They've got to pay the rent.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.360
They've got to pay their bills.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.960
There's two ways

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.280
you can be paid as a journalist, right?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.280
You can sell journalism, sell news to the people,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.800
or you can sell your services to the rich and say,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800
if you pay me, I will sell stories that promote

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800
the ideas that you want to promote.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.400
You know, if you are an American watching this channel,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.160
you'll be very aware of where that ends up.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.120
You end up with extremely biased media.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.800
Their job is not to tell you the truth,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.000
their job is to sell a certain story for you

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.160
because they get paid

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.240
by very rich people

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.160
who want you to believe certain things.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.360
So this is the effect of inequality.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.360
This is the effect of inequality. This is...

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.520
this Musk thing makes it really, really clear

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.920
how inequality affects you.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.880
If you allow the rich

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.040
to get really, really rich

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.840
to get really, really powerful,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.120
they outbid you for control of your politicians.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.120
They outbid you for control of your media,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.240
and they outbid you for access to your resources.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.360
And then what you get is politicians

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.880
who don't care about you,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.360
media who lies to you,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.480
and the inability to access resources,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.040
which includes things like food and housing.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.120
And where does that lead us?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.000
As soon as Donald Trump won the election,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.840
Tesla stock price doubled.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.880
Tesla's stock price doubled.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.520
Why did Tesla's stock price double

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.480
when Donald Trump won the election?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.400
Because traders think

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.160
that Donald Trump is going to use taxpayer money.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.200
Your money if you're an American

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.960
to give to Tesla and to give to Elon Musk.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.800
That is what inequality does.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.040
Inequality

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.480
gives the rich

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.440
the power to directly access your tax dollars.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.560
That is the end result.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.440
That is why you need to care about inequality.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440
That is why you need to care

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.800
about the distribution of wealth.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.080
That is why you need to care

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.000
about the distribution of power.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.040
Okay, so that's my first point done.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.280
Elon Musk makes it really clear

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.720
that inequality affects you in a material way.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.120
The second point,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120
I wanted to talk a little bit about Elon Musk's

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.120
support of far right parties across the world.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.960
When I say far right, what

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.720
I mean is anti-immigration parties.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.720
I know some people don't like the term far right.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.520
Why is Elon Musk supporting

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.840
anti-immigration parties all around the world?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.800
And to me, this is...

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.200
it's really, really obvious

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.240
why he comes in and supports that.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.280
And I want to talk a little bit about it,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.000
because I never hear this

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480
discussed really in the media.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.760
So on this channel

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.560
I talk a lot about, and I have been talking a lot

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.600
about for a long time,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.600
the fact that the economy

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.880
is going to keep getting worse,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.360
living standards will keep falling.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.120
It'll be difficult for you to get financial security,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.520
to get good quality housing, to get good quality jobs.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.800
And because inequality will keep rising,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.080
that will keep getting worse.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.640
And I think

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.200
when I first started saying that, you know,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.160
and I first like betting on this back in 2011,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.480
that was a really

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.160
not popular opinion.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.880
There was a general sort of consideration

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.760
that the economy was getting better

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.320
and it would recover. It would get better.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.280
Now, as I say this, at the beginning of....

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.600
at the beginning of 2025,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.760
I think it's becoming increasingly obvious

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.080
to people who are watching that,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.200
that is what is happening.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.120
The economy is on a structural downtrend.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.240
Things are going to get worse and worse.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.800
And as that happens,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.000
it creates an obvious tension in politics,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.960
which is that

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.360
people do not want to accept the situation

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.080
where their family gets poorer every generation.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
People don't want their kids

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.040
to be poorer than they are.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.200
People don't want their grandkids to live in poverty

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.840
and people demand change in politics.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.560
And I think whilst

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.760
a lot of these kind of old school politicians

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.720
cling on to this hope that we can keep going

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.760
the way we're going,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.560
it's becoming increasingly obvious to anybody,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.920
kind of half smart,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.680
that people are going to increasingly

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.800
demand some kind of change.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.760
What that means is

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.680
we're kind of already in a situation

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.160
now in our society where there has to be a discussion

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.200
and there is already discussion about

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200
where do we go, how do we change things.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.720
And I think in the next

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.880
ten years, probably, maybe sooner,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.240
you will see a significant change

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.840
in the way our politics is run,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.280
what politicians offer and what people demand.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.760
And that is because

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.040
the status quo is increasingly

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.040
obviously not working for most people.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.800
So if you're somebody like Elon Musk

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.920
and you are the richest person in the entire world,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.480
you're going to look at a changing world

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.920
and you're going to look at people

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.280
that are demanding different things.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.960
You're going to look at people who,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.880
people like me

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.040
who are demanding

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.920
less inequality, higher taxation of the rich, lower

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.600
taxation of ordinary workers. And

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.080
there's an obvious

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.840
reflex reaction for somebody like Elon

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.040
Musk where he says, well,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.160
I don't want to pay higher taxes.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.720
So I want to avoid this

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.920
outcome of higher taxes on the rich.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.440
So you need to sell a different story.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.120
And I think it's... it's

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.760
already really clear what the

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.760
big alternative stories are.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.680
Our story, which is getting bigger,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.840
the reason you're getting poorer

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.080
is because of the super rich,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.040
need to tax the super rich more.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.080
But there's one story which is much bigger than that,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.920
which is the reason you’re poor

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.280
is because of immigrants.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.880
The reason you’re poor is because of foreigners.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.080
And if you are Elon Musk,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080
you're looking out there in the world of,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.160
you know, new alternative economic ideas.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.640
Which one of those ideas do you want to win?

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.520
Now, I would like to make it clear,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.360
I think a sensible billionaire

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.560
would probably realise it's economically

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.920
destabilising to keep inequality growing more and more.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.880
But most billionaires don't think like that.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.720
They just don't want to pay higher taxes.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.680
They want to keep getting richer.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.880
They're kind of obsessed with it.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.320
That's why they get rich.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.760
So what are you going to do?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.880
You are going to financially support

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.520
the idea that immigrants are the problem.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.800
And I'm not...

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.080
I think sometimes people think that I'm

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.040
some sort of super pro-immigration guy.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.280
I'm not a super pro-immigration guy.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.960
I recognise that it is massively

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.560
in the interests of the rich to tell you

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.000
that the problem is immigrants,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.800
because if you don't think the problem is immigrants,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.840
you might work out

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.000
that the reason you're getting poor

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.320
is because of the super rich,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.440
and they don't want you to know that. So

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.880
this is the situation Elon Musk is in.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.960
He's going to support that.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.280
And it's the truth is,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.320
and something increasingly worries me,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.280
it's not just Elon Musk is going to support that.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.680
You know, other super

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.000
rich people are going to support this idea

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.080
because they realise

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.640
that hatred of foreigners and hatred of immigrants

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.040
is the main thing

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.880
standing between them

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.280
and high levels of taxation,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.240
and they don't want to pay more tax.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.880
So they're going to fund it,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.200
they're going to fund these ideas.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.520
And more and more money is going to flood into that.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.320
If inequality keeps increasing

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.600
and keeps increasing and keeps increasing,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.160
living standards will get worse

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.280
and worse and worse and worse.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.160
It will be extremely destabilising,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.440
and it will destabilise an economy

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.320
which already provides

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.520
unbelievable levels of luxury

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.120
to the rich and the super rich.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.520
I don't think this is the right

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.840
thing for billionaires to do.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.080
You know, there's this story,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.000
I don't know how true it is, that the reason that

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.840
the French

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.040
cut off the heads of the rich and the English didn't

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.040
is because the English accepted...

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.960
the English super rich accepted...

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.520
they need to give a bit back,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.280
and they gave a little bit back to ordinary people.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.240
They increased living standards of ordinary people.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.000
And apparently that's why we still have a royal family.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.680
And the French royal familiar are all dead.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.160
I think a sensible billionaire would accept

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.000
that if they stop inequality from increasing,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.760
we can stabilise this fall in living standards.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.120
And they can protect their own situation.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.360
But the fact is, most super rich don't think like that.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.480
They very simplistically want to keep their taxes down.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.480
I wanted to talk a little bit about where that puts

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.080
these guys, people like Musk, who are funding

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.760
and increasingly funding

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.720
anti-immigrant political parties,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.400
anti-immigrant ideas because

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.240
what is interesting is

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.520
it is in their interests for people to hate foreigners

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.680
and for people to hate migrants,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.040
and for people to think that migration is

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.920
the key problem.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.920
But it is, interestingly, also in their interests

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.240
to keep migration high because

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.160
what these guys primarily need

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.120
is for you to hate migrants

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.880
and for you to think migration is the problem.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.440
And the best way for them to achieve

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.280
that is to have loads of stuff

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.240
in the media saying migrants are the problem

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.240
and also to have really high levels of immigration,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.520
because if immigration is really low,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.360
first of all, it will rapidly become clear

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.880
that that didn't stop the economy from getting worse.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.320
But secondly, it's a lot

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.040
easier to get people to hate migrants

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.720
when there's loads of migrants coming all the time.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.360
And that is why you see

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.080
Trump in this really interesting situation

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.640
where he's simultaneously

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.840
funding anti-migrant parties

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.040
and arguing

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.000
that we need to have high levels of immigration

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.720
in the US.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.440
And it really, really reminds me

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.400
of what the Conservatives did when they were in power.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.160
So the Conservatives,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.200
and I think this is the smartest thing they did,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.240
and I'm surprised

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.120
in a way that they've got people

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.440
smart enough to do this.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.840
The Conservatives really,

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.720
really fought hard to have a specific

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.880
kind of migrant kicked out of the country,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.440
which was illegal migrants coming over in small boats.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.800
At the same time, the Conservatives did Brexit.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.560
Before Brexit, the UK has to accept EU migrants.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.440
There's a degree to which the UK doesn't control

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.480
the level of immigration, of legal immigration.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.680
After Brexit, the UK can choose

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.320
how much legal immigration it has.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.840
So the Conservative Party basically had complete power

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.280
over the vast majority of migration,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.320
illegal migration is only,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.480
I think, 2 or 3% of overall immigration,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.560
97%, 98% is legal migration,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.000
which they could have reduced. But they didn't.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.440
They did this

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.080
really interesting thing of

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.520
really aggressively trying to stop this really small

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.200
kind of immigration that they couldn't actually stop,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.160
and massively increasing the number of visas,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.400
which they gave legally to non EU immigrants.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400
It was like super, super smart.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.880
They managed to simultaneously portray themselves

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.520
as the party of low migration

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.400
whilst massively increasing

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.320
non-EU migration to the country.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.480
And I think this kind of

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.400
shows you in a way, what

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.960
the correct tactical play is from the billionaires.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.000
Tell you to hate migrants,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.400
and make sure there's tons of immigration,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.400
because that makes you hate people,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.800
that makes you hate immigrants.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.280
And

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.560
I think the final thing that we learn from

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.480
Elon Musk is basically how important it is

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:05.560
for billionaires, that you guys hate each other.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.080
So what I try to do on this channel

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.200
is to make it clear to you

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.480
that

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.120
the reason you're getting poorer

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.800
is because inequality is rapidly increasing.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.080
If you don't stop inequality rapidly increasing,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.640
you will keep getting poorer.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.920
The only way you can really protect yourselves

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.160
is by working together

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.480
as a mass of not super rich people.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.160
And using that political power,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.480
that only works if you guys don't hate each other.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.760
And every week I put these videos out

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.880
and I get people in the comments saying

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.080
that's never going to work.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.600
People are never going to work together.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.200
Tell me how I can protect myself.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.160
Tell me what I can do.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.040
Give me trading tips. Told me how I can protect myself.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.280
Rising inequality, rising top 1% inequality,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.880
means more and more and more of you lose every year.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.360
There's no way to change that

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.920
other than stopping inequality from rising.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.840
I think what people like Elon Musk want

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.720
is for you guys all to be living in this Squid Game

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.200
where you all think, I don't care

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.400
if only one of us will win and 99% of us will lose.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.320
I want to fight the people around me to be in that 1%.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.320
You need to change the game.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.120
You need to change the game.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.920
You cannot

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.960
play a game where every single year,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.600
95% of you lose,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.520
96% of you

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.920
lose, 97% of you lose,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.440
and you keep hoping to be in that 1%.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.280
You need to change the rules of the game,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.080
and that means working together.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.520
So to conclude,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.240
Elon Musk is a great example of

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.280
why inequality is a danger for you and your family.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.680
These guys are going to take the things that you need.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.120
They're going to take your politicians,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.320
your economists, your media,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.880
and ultimately your housing and your food.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.960
That is what it means.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.120
You need to fight inequality.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.560
The only way to do that is to work together.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.200
That's why these billionaires want you

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.880
to hate each other.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.960
If you hate each other, they’ll win.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.600
If you work together, you can win.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.040
Support

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.840
the channel,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.120
tax the rich, cut tax on ordinary working people.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.600
Send this to your friends, send this to your mum.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.960
Thanks for your help. Good luck.
