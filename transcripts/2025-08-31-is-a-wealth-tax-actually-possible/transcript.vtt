00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Correct implementation on tax policy is a job of

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.800
experts and government and and civil service.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.600
It is not the job of ******* YouTubers.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.160
All right, so we'll do one on implementation

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.480
of wealth taxes and how to reduce inequality.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.840
And the reason we have to do that is

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.800
because we are, like, increasingly doing

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.520
really, really, really well on narrative.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680
We are influencing what the media talk about.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120
We're influencing the debate on this.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.200
Like, we have a massive presence in the debate now.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.240
Governments are failing, especially the government

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
here in the UK is really, really unpopular and they

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
will have to do something or they will

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.440
lose really badly in the next election.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.080
And increasingly we are looking like quite well-positioned

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.680
to be the way that they might have to turn.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.040
So they might come to us and we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.080
might, we might get something.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.480
And what worries me is there is like a phenomenal

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.320
naivety at the moment in the way that people

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.800
are talking about wealth taxes, basically.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520
And basically that people seem to think that

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.640
the government can just turn around and say,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.320
"Okay, let's do wealth taxes.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200
Let's tax the rich now and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.480
things will be fixed." Right?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440
The truth is, and I've always said this,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920
I've never tried to hide this, actually

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.960
raising taxes on the rich is going to be really,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.760
really hard for a variety of reasons, right?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.320
One of the biggest reasons is obviously

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.920
they control a lot of the media narrative.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.440
They can sell lot of scare stories.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.040
"If you tax us, we'll leave." Or they

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.600
can do a lot of sort of personally

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.160
attacking of me as an individual.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.640
But the truth is there are things they can

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.120
do and you need to deal with those things.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.720
Like the truth is they can leave, right?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.760
And I've always said, and I constantly believe,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.320
you know, look at the Abramovich situation,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.760
which shows like here's a rich man who tried to leave.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.880
And we just said, "Okay, well you can leave, but if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.480
you're going to own British assets, we can tax British

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.440
assets." And that's always been my comeback to that.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.000
And that is true, but you need make sure

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.160
that you have your legal systems in place.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.680
Like people sometimes ask me, you know,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.880
"If you were Chancellor, what would you do?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.000
If you were Prime Minister, what would you do?"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.320
And I always turn around and say, "Listen, goddamn,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.440
like, it's not that easy." The implementation

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.640
and the design... the correct implementation

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.200
and the correct design of this tax

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.280
or these taxes, it has to be so good.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.000
It has be really, really good.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600
And there's... I think, a sensible government

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.400
at this point would be calling me...

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.360
Like the sensible thing do is to call me up and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.400
say, "All right, look, we get it, right?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.560
We see..." Like the argument I'm making is correct.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680
Inequality is increasing really, really quickly.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.880
The rich are rapidly increasing their wealth.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.480
It's squeezing everybody out.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.800
It's destroying the middle class.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.080
It's destroying the government.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.920
It's having and will continue to have like

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.720
really destructive effects on living standards.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.920
You need to fix it.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.520
Like 100% you need to fix it.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.120
The only way to really do that is to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.280
aggressively increase taxes on the rich.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.960
The truth is that's ******* hard to do.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.200
So they should be calling me up and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.640
saying, "Listen, okay, we see it.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.480
You, you know, you're right.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.400
We understand now.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.320
Okay, you don't deal with

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.000
inequality, you're kind of ****ed.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.360
But the rich are saying they're going to leave.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.160
We don't really... We don't

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.800
think it's possible." You know what I mean?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.440
So then you call me up and you say,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.000
"Okay, all right, let's put the *******

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.840
work in." We put the ******* work in.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.040
We design this tax so that it's ******* good.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.000
So it's watertight.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.560
You know, you look at things like what China

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.600
does. China doesn't allow you to own a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.080
**** ton of Chinese wealth and live overseas.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.600
You ask the question, you realistically discuss

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.120
the question, how much can the UK do by itself?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.760
Or realistically, do we need international corporation?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.200
International corporation is achievable.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.640
If you look at when we last significantly reduced

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.760
inequality, it was in the aftermath of World

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
War II, and it was done internationally.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.520
Everybody did it together and it worked.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.560
The truth is, this would be difficult

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.880
for the UK, specifically the UK.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.000
I think a massive country like the US

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.840
would probably have an easier time, especially

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.280
when you consider how many of the billionaires

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280
and the massive companies are based in the US.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.400
I think the US would have an

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.600
easier time to do it by itself.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.360
I think a country like the UK could do some things

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.320
by themselves, but like why do it by yourself?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.480
This problem is happening everywhere.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240
We have a mass opportunity to

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.560
build something internationally here.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.360
But there's this like real childish naivety,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.040
which is like, okay, fine, just give it like...

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.800
The big thing that you see, and this I

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.480
think really encapsulates the childish naivety

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.200
that I talk about, is people turn around me

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.680
and they say, "Okay, I'll show... all right.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.400
Show me the tax policy then.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.200
Show me the tax policy." You know,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.080
listen, I'm here in my kitchen, right?

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.520
Which is real, like with a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.640
massive ******* YouTube channel.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.960
Like, I'm pretty much, pretty obviously

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.400
the world's biggest campaigner for wealth

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400
taxes and I work ******* hard, right?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.160
Do you think tax policies are

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.640
usually made by YouTubers?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.080
Like, tax policy is not you give... We

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720
spoke about this in the tariffs video, right?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.040
Which is that the Trump tariffs had

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.920
this similar vibe, which is like some

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.800
random intern, like, bashed it together.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.640
Oh, Cambodia.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.880
Yeah, **** Cambodia.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.480
You know what I mean?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.280
Like, what is this idiocracy behavior?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.560
Listen, if you want good tax policy, you need

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.720
to pay good ******* tax people and you need to

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.880
sit them in a room for a long ******* time and

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.520
you need to make sure they design that policy.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.000
Even if I was the ******* smartest guy in the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.480
world, you wouldn't want one ******* guy to design...

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.280
This is not *******... Do you remember that Little

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.000
Britain, write the theme tune, sing the theme tune?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.280
It's like, you know, like,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.720
alright, you, oh, you're the campaigner.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.880
You ******* make it yourself then.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.920
What have we become as a country. Like, listen,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.880
if you want good tax policy, you need to pay proper

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.520
tax experts for their expertise and their time.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.640
And you spend... Listen, you spend two years

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.240
designing the tax policy, obviously.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.520
Obviously.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720
It's idiotic this approach.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.040
Listen, I would be more than happy, more than

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.680
******* happy to be involved in making sure

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000
this tax policy is designed well, obviously.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.120
But the way that you do that is you get the tax

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.120
experts, you talk to me, you talk to the other

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.080
guys, you build a team of proper good tax experts.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.880
You think about the question of how do we

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.160
deal with people who leave the country?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.760
Can we still tax them on the UK assets like,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.240
like we did to Abramovich, like China does?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.320
You look at how these issues

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.280
were dealt with in the past.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.360
You look at how wealth inequality was reduced

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.600
significantly in the 20th century. You

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.640
have sensible discussions, but I'm constantly faced

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.880
with these like idiotically simplistic discussions

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.880
which are totally bad faith, which is like, "Oh, okay.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.680
You've recognised that the ship's going to sink.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360
Well, why don't you ******* fix the hole your

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.000
******* self then, you ******* idiot?" It's

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400
unbelievably childish and it's unbelievably chaotic.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.480
Like, listen, we're supposed to be

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.360
adult, grownup, mature countries here.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.520
I have correctly identified a massive problem

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.240
in our economy that is going to devastate

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.400
living standards if nothing is done about it.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.320
You need to fix that with well-designed tax policy and

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.000
well-designed tax policy takes experts and it takes

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.720
money and it takes resources and it takes hard work.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.320
So and that is the message.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.680
You know, that is the message.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.880
So listen, we're winning the debate and

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.000
it's not just because of me, but that's because

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.600
I've been focused on winning the ******* debate.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.280
Okay.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.600
Implementation is going to be hard.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.480
You know, and I emailed... Just this week I emailed

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.480
Gabriel Zucman, who is French economist who

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.360
I've got a lot of time and a lot of respect for,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.520
he's working on similar things.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.320
And I said to him, "Listen, dear Gabriel,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.640
we're winning the debate here.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.400
Who have we got working on

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.960
implementation?" You know what I mean?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.400
Because listen, I can't do

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.040
******* everything by myself.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.160
You know what I mean?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.840
Correct implementation on tax policy is a job of

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.240
experts and government and civil service.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.280
It is not the job of *******

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.480
YouTubers, you know what I mean?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.720
And we need to win the debate and

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.040
we need to win implementation.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.480
And, you know, I want to be clear, right?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.520
I know I've campaigned for 2%

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.960
on wealth of above 10 million, you know.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.040
That's what I do.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.200
That's what Patriotic Millionaires do.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.040
That would be good.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.760
But like, this is not like I've sat

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.280
down and picked the perfect tax policy.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.920
And people sometimes criticise me like,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.720
"Oh, that form of wealth tax is not good.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.160
We need another form of wealth tax." I'm here for that.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.880
Let's have those discussions,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.520
let's build a tax policy, you know?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.800
But this kind of really stupid shutting

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800
down of the debate is, "Oh, you've correctly

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.000
identified that our economy's going to be devastated.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.120
Well, why don't you fix it?"

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.600
We need to grow up basically.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.280
We need to grow up.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.040
But, you know, the reason I'm here and I've

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.680
finally done a video on implementation is because

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.720
we're winning the debate and I'm really proud of,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.240
of myself and so should you be, the work you've put

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.840
on it and so should everybody watching, because

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.680
this... What I think is really interesting

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.920
about like our, like, increasing narrative

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.840
victory here is people go on TV, so like when

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.760
like... It's Neil Kinnock is his name, right?

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.280
Is it Neil?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.440
When he went on TV recently and he was like, "2%

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.520
wealth tax above 10 million." That is exactly

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.760
the wealth tax that I campaigned for, but

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.920
he didn't say Gary Stevenson wealth tax.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.160
And he probably didn't hear it from me, right?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.640
Like, and we don't have a massive

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.840
presence in the mainstream media.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.080
Like, the way that we do this is we feed it into

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.840
the public and it comes up from the public to

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.960
the newspapers and to the politicians and, like,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.960
it's... I think this is, I think

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.600
it's kind of inspiring to show how much power

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.080
the public has if they stick to a message, right?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.680
And if they're very clear on it.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640
It shows that, like, you know,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.520
a YouTuber, you know, it's not just me, you know.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.200
I mentioned before, Patriotic Millionaires and

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.760
all these other guys who do their good work.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.160
We can drive it up.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.680
We can drive it up through the people.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.600
But then, you know, if politicians

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.680
turn around and say, "Oh, okay, great.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.560
Let's just..." You know.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.680
We're not going to provide the policy, you know.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.840
And we were speaking this week about, you know,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.040
maybe we could try and get some funding to get

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.160
some tax le-... I'll be honest with you,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.440
I'm ******* busy here, you know what I mean?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.160
And it's stressful and I'm doing a lot of work and

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.440
I'm really focused on narrative and I think the

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.280
work that we do here is really, really, really vital.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.760
So we were thinking about like getting some experts in

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.120
to fund tax... to actually work on implementation

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.600
and trying to get some money for that.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.320
But the truth is, the honest

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.800
truth is, it shouldn't be our job.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.560
It shouldn't be our job and I know like, you

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.920
know, I do lot of jobs that shouldn't be my job,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.520
but, I would like to do a shout-out to like

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.840
governments, not just here in the UK, right?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.920
Because this is an international problem.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.800
Governments and, real governments that

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.600
want fix their ******* problems, you need to work...

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.480
you need to fund the policy on tax work on this.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.040
Civil services across the country,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.640
including this country, think tanks.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.720
Listen, I'm working my tits off out here.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.840
Get your best people working on how we do this.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.120
And, you know, I would love to help and,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.360
if the UK Government was to

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.040
call me, I'd definitely make time for it.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.720
This is not ******* Gary Stevenson

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.040
saves the world, you know?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.640
We need other people helping to design this.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.320
I'm 100% aware and I've always been aware, effectively

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.400
implementing tax on the richest people will be hard.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.360
I've never ever, ever said anything else and I know it

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.200
was hard and I knew from the start it would be hard.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.760
And I, if I'm honest, I never thought

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.360
we'd get as far as we have already come.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.960
But I don't do this because it's easy.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.520
I do this because it's essential.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.880
This is as simple as that.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.800
It's as simple as that.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.800
If you don't want your country to collapse

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.760
into poverty, you have to deal with this.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.960
We've got the people, we've got the experts,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.880
get them in a ******* room together, pay them

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.400
what they need and get that tax policy *******

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.360
sorted and give it the time it needs.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.840
And I would like to see, you know,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.360
this is not a UK specific problem.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.960
I want to see politicians and economists

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.440
and civil servants in Germany, in Italy, in

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.880
Spain, in France, in Japan, in Australia.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.160
I would say America, but we're not likely get them.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.520
Oh, and Canada, because they always

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.680
complain that I don't mention them.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.040
And New Zealand, get a lot of those.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.480
Listen, what I'm looking for is like

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.040
ruthless practicality and pragmatism.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.320
How do we effectively get wealth back

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.560
from the very rich, or at the very least

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.360
stop, them from taking more of our wealth?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.040
Which has an understanding of the fact

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.920
that a lot of those rich are domestic,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.680
but a lot of those rich are also overseas.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.720
And how does... And they, they're

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.160
immobile, and how do we deal with that?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.320
That is thing that can be dealt with.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.040
It's been dealt with in the

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.640
past, it can be dealt with again.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.600
And I will always say when people say it's

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.720
not possible, it was done in the 20th century.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.040
It was done in the 20th century, inequality was reduced

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.840
massively and we should look at how they did that.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.800
JACK: On international corporation,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.040
there is a minimum corporation tax now that was...

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.960
Yeah, I mean, and that's Gabriel Zucman.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.520
I'm pretty sure that's Gabriel

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.680
Zucman, and, and... You know, I'm

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.480
not the only guy out here, you know.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.040
I'm very visible, I've chosen the YouTube

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.640
strategy, but, you know, I mentioned Rebecca

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.960
Gowland and Patriotic Millionaires, Gabriel Zucman,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.160
Thomas Pierki, Aaron Advani, and there'll be

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.480
1,000 other guys across the world doing this work.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.800
All of you boffins out there, tax experts,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.200
economists, start building these policies.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.640
Start building these policies.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.800
Once we've won this debate and I stop

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.680
having to ******* argue it again and again,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.760
I'll come out there and I'll help you

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.840
build the policy, but I can't do it myself.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.520
Implementation will be hard, you have to do it.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.360
I'll keep making the videos.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.440
Let's get you boffins to start making the policies.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.000
Listen, we got four years in this

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.760
country before the next election.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.960
Labour, you've got four years, but it's going to

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.160
take... it's going to take two or three to get this right.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.600
So, start moving.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.720
Thank you very much.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.720
Tax wealth not work.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.240
Send it your friends, send it to your mum.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.400
I'm done for the day.
