  "description": "\"We have never once supported higher taxes on working people, this channel has always been about higher taxes on people with huge amounts of accumulated hoarded wealth. If you don't tax them they will use their enormous amounts of income to buy the rest of the wealth, wealth inequality will get higher and higher we will lose our middle class and we will fall into poverty.
