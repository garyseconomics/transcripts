  "description": "\"Whenever you hear in\u00a0the media the term 'Fiscal Black Hole' I want\u00a0you to hear 'Fiscal enormous pile of money', because it is not possible for debt to grow\u00a0without private wealth growing.  And whenever\u00a0anybody tells you: 'How do we pay the debt\u00a0back?' I want you to turn around and say\u00a0to them: Where has the money gone?  Who has the\u00a0money now?  Why don't we tax them?\"\n\n\"How The Rich Get Richer From Covid 19\" can be found here: https://youtu.be/EiblHqbpXHs\n\nI want to quickly cover the idea of the debt being owed to foreigners - whilst some UK debt is owed to foreigners, there is also much ownership of foreign debt by people in the UK.  Data shows that the amount of money flowing out of the UK actually REDUCED during covid, so we know that the vast majority of money giving out during covid stayed in the country.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE, SHARE & START A CONVERSATION\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\nWEBSITE - https://www.wealtheconomics.org\nTWITTER - @garyseconomics - https://twitter.com/garyseconomics\nFACEBOOK - @garyseconomics - https://www.facebook.com/garyseconomics/\nINSTAGRAM - @garyseconomics - https://www.instagram.com/garyseconomics/\nTIKTOK - @garyseconomics - https://www.tiktok.com/@garyseconomics?lang=en\nYOUTUBE - @garyseconomics - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Ghe5TBQGYIOANuiNW4hDQ\n\n\nPerformed by Gary Stevenson\nGARYSECONOMICS\n\n\nProduced by Simran Mohan\nMOHAN MEDIA",
