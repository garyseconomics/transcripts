You don't need to be an economist, you say okay well if the rich get a ton of money they're going to push the prices up, which will be fine for them because they've got a ton of money. That will hurt the rest of us right and the rich will start to consume a larger share of the natural resources and natural resources become more expensive for the rest of us, that's not complicated okay. That happened it's obvious it's obvious and that's \u00a3450 billion pounds and now Rishi Sunak like is on tv saying oh don't worry we stand by ready to help with \u00a35 billion pounds. You give \u00a3450 billion pounds to the rich and then you say we're gonna help with \u00a35 billion pounds. It's not it's not gonna it's not going to help right and then Labour say we're going to do a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and we're going to raise \u00a32 billion pounds. These guys are so far out of touch you know they're playing a different game you know if you transfer \u00a3450 billion pounds to the rich and then you you take \u00a35 billion pounds back, you're going to destroy the economy right! but but who's talking about it? listen...\"",
