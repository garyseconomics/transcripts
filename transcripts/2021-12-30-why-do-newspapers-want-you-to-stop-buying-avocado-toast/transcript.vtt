00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.480
okay so i want to do one on avocado on toast&nbsp;
actually no that sounds like a joke but um i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880
actually this is an important issue that people&nbsp;
need to understand alright so one thing that i've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.360
realised recently and i'm sure people watching&nbsp;
would have seen this is a lot of newspapers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.680
running articles that saying i gave up starbucks&nbsp;
and i gave up avocado on toast for three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.760
and then i bought this five hundred thousand pound&nbsp;
flat and the article was always like how i managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.920
to buy this Â£500,000 in London or how&nbsp;i
managed to be mortgage-free by the age of 35&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.800
this kind of thing like all stories about how&nbsp;
young people managed to be and get this amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.280
property or manage to have their mortgage right&nbsp;
and it's always you know i really scrimped and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.080
saved i gave up avocado on toast i stopped going&nbsp;
to starbucks i bought my own packed lunch to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.960
and then if you read these articles and&nbsp;
i promise you go and read through them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.600
you will always see about two thirds of the way&nbsp;
down they just slipped in and then you know i used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.600
that money plus 200 grand which i borrowed from&nbsp;
my mom and then i bought this property and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.440
always like wait wait a minute wait a minute so&nbsp;
you stopped eating avocado toast and you and but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.760
also you got 200 grand from your mom and i think&nbsp;
this is important for a couple of reasons firstly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.840
because one thing that i see amongst my friendship&nbsp;
group right like i went to a grammar school and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.040
went to like elite universities so i know some&nbsp;
people from pretty well-off families but i also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.840
know some people from families that are that&nbsp;
are poor or not well off right and what i see is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.800
the kids from well our families buy properties&nbsp;
and they get a gift from their parents you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.160
it might be 50 grand it might be 150&nbsp;
grand they might be 250 grand right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.480
because that's what you need to be able to buy&nbsp;
a property in london nowadays or in a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.960
cities you know what i mean a lot of australian&nbsp;
cities are even worse the amount of money you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.000
need to get a deposit and um then my kids&nbsp;
from my kids my mates from poorer families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.320
they see other people buying property and there's&nbsp;
no way they can do it because they can't get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.440
deposit they don't understand how are these guys&nbsp;
able to buy property and i'm not and the reason is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.560
because increasingly the only way to get property&nbsp;
nowadays is to get massive gift from your parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.760
and people from poor families don't see that&nbsp;
so the first thing i want to do is open this up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.400
because these newspapers give a misleading idea&nbsp;
that if you just worked a little harder you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.920
saved a little more you can get a property but&nbsp;
the reality if you look at these articles is it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.040
almost impossible in many places without a massive&nbsp;
gift from your parents so if there are people out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.120
there who are watching feeling bad like i can't&nbsp;
afford property it's not what these articles are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360
saying the truth is realistically if you're from&nbsp;
the wrong family nowadays it's almost impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.560
to get property that's the first thing but the&nbsp;
second thing is i think it highlights a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.600
bit something important about how economics and&nbsp;
media works right like i did an interview other day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.480
and the person i was up against works for the IEA
institute of economic affairs sounds really fancy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.880
right that's a think tank funded by billionaires&nbsp;
they pay people to go on the radio and say don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.920
tax billionaires that's what it is basically and&nbsp;
so much of the media is owned by billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.240
times owned by billionaires the sun owned by&nbsp;
billionaires talk radio owned by billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.080
the daily mail owned by billionaires right so all&nbsp;
of these newspapers and all these radio stations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.280
sky news owned by billionaires they're&nbsp;
all owned by billionaires so obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.280
they are going to send people out&nbsp;
there to say don't tax billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.840
and bear that in mind whenever you&nbsp;
see what these newspapers say but also

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.400
i think they want to give the impression that&nbsp;
things are okay as they are because at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.840
they don't want things to change but things are&nbsp;
working super well for the billionaires and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.600
the moment we have the situation in this country&nbsp;
and also in a lot of countries where for older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.680
generations who own their own property things&nbsp;
look okay because the property prices have gone up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.440
and i'll talk a lot about this in my video on&nbsp;
housing but for younger generations they're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.680
a situation where it's impossible for them to&nbsp;
purchase property and it's impossible to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.440
financial security and to save up the assets&nbsp;
you need to have a pension or to raise a family

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.400
but older people often don't see this and as&nbsp;
a result they vote for parties which are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.160
doing anything about supporting those people&nbsp;
but if they knew i think if a lot of older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.680
people realized how difficult situation was the&nbsp;
younger generation they would vote against it but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.720
the newspapers tell them oh it's okay as long as&nbsp;
they pull their socks up stop buying avocado toast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.760
stop going to starbucks they'll be okay and get&nbsp;
property but the reality of it is increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.920
more and more families in this country and&nbsp;
then a lot of countries around the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.600
are unable to afford property and these newspapers&nbsp;
are giving a misleading idea like it's just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.720
problem of young people being silly but it's not&nbsp;
because house price the average house price in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.560
london is like 600 grand now and the average&nbsp;
wage is like 30 grand you know you're gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.800
have to stop buying coffee for what like 300 years&nbsp;
or something it's not going to happen right so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.760
yeah you know it's about avocado toast but it's&nbsp;
not about avocado toast it's about understanding

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.400
that very rich people spend a lot of money to&nbsp;
to give you these ideas about economics and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.320
understanding that a lot of the economic&nbsp;
messages we receive are biased and often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.480
they're designed to stop you from pushing back&nbsp;
because the system as it is is working really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.040
really well for the super rich um and yeah you&nbsp;
know watching other videos where we talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.040
inequality the ones we talk about how taxes are&nbsp;
being raised on working people are not on the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.760
like why is that raising your taxes watch what&nbsp;
as well if i watch the housing video but um

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.760
understand that we've got a serious problem here&nbsp;
that will not get better unless we do something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.000
and a lot of the people in power are not&nbsp;
incentivized to do it so if we want change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.720
we're to have to make it happen&nbsp;
ourselves so yeah educate yourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.480
watch my videos share the message

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.840
let's make things change

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.320
so it's intentionally designed national&nbsp;
insurance so that very rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.960
pay a very low percent wealth inequality pushes&nbsp;
house prices up money printing pushes house prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.760
up so how's price go through the roof but at the&nbsp;
same time well through equality pushes wages down
