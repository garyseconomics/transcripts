00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
if by this point you're a little overwhelmed by&nbsp;
wonky economic language never fear I'm joined by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.640
Economist and former Market Trader Gary Stevenson&nbsp;
to make it all make sense Gary thank you so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.500
for coming back on the show first of all um from&nbsp;
first principles or what is a Government Bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.120
okay so the first thing to understand is when&nbsp;
the government borrows money it borrows money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.740
from people from things like Pension funds&nbsp;
from wealthy individuals and when you lend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
money to the government you get a Government&nbsp;
Bond and basically that that's tradable so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.460
can lend money to the government and then sell&nbsp;
the Government Bond and then somebody else will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.860
be owed the money so essentially it's a tradable&nbsp;
IOU from the government so why has there been this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
movement in the market where the value of British&nbsp;
government bonds has dramatically decreased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
it's completely a response to the the&nbsp;
announcement from the government basically so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.580
if you look at what the government has&nbsp;
done you know in the last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.680
there's been a massive massive&nbsp;
increase in government debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.180
um but that was a one-up emergency because of Kobe&nbsp;
and now suddenly out of nowhere the government has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.300
decided that they're going to do this bonfire on&nbsp;
taxes of the riches you know um Traders look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.060
that and they basically think okay well if you're&nbsp;
not going to tax the rich people who have all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.380
world you're not going to be able to to pay the&nbsp;
debt back and that basically leads to sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
essentially the reason governments can take&nbsp;
large debts is because the economy grows and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.160
because there's inflation when inflation happens&nbsp;
it devalues the debt makes it easy to pay back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
Traders and economists don't believe this is&nbsp;
going to have any growth so they're saying really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.400
the government is going to have to do one of two&nbsp;
things which is not pay the debt back or create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.280
inflation and they sell the pound because there's&nbsp;
going to be inflation pounds are worth less that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.720
means there will be inflation because when the&nbsp;
pound collapse in Imports become more expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.760
which means the Central Bank who has a job to&nbsp;
control inflation will then have to raise rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.780
and markets are expecting a massive increase in&nbsp;
interest rates so Traders they look at the central&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.500
bank and they think well these guys are going&nbsp;
to raise rates massively so why am I going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.520
hold government bonds that give me three percent&nbsp;
when the central bank is expected now to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.380
rates to five six or even seven percent it seems&nbsp;
like the big event that sort of forced the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.140
of England to make this dramatic intervention um&nbsp;
was the potential for a run Dynamic on Pension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.720
funds so what would a run Dynamic on Pension&nbsp;
funds be why would that be caused by a loss of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.660
value in government bonds okay so let's explain&nbsp;
this from Basics okay so obviously lots of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.900
have money in a pension and a big investment&nbsp;
that a lot of Pension funds do is to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.780
government wants now some Pension funds in order&nbsp;
to sort of boost their buck and get a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.180
more bang for their money they borrow money to&nbsp;
buy even more government bonds so that way you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.500
can borrow cheaply you buy more government&nbsp;
bonds you can get a little bit extra return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.980
um now in the last especially in the last&nbsp;
month but in the whole of the last year because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.580
Interest Bank of England&nbsp;
interest rates have been rising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.860
the value of bonds have been steadily falling&nbsp;
because now interest rates have been nearly zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.240
for the last 10 15 years that means that a lot&nbsp;
of these bonds have very very low interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.340
now if the central bank is going to start paying&nbsp;
three four five six percent on cash you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.500
to be holding a zero interest Government Bond so&nbsp;
Traders have been selling these government bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.300
Pension funds who have borrowed money to buy&nbsp;
loads of government bonds and suddenly in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.080
situation where you've borrowed a million quid&nbsp;
you've bought a million quid of government bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.060
and those bonds are only worth 900 800 000&nbsp;
pounds now so the people who lent the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.660
are turning around to them and saying okay well&nbsp;
we need you to front up some more money because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.620
we don't we don't trust you anymore because&nbsp;
the assets you hold are not worth enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.180
well then that means the Pension funds to pay&nbsp;
that money have to sell the bonds which drives the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.340
bond price down even further and you can get this&nbsp;
vicious spiral where institutions such as Pension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.620
funds continue you have to sell the asset in&nbsp;
order to pay back the debt which drives the price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.240
further and further down and and the price keeps&nbsp;
falling and these institutions can go bankrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.920
so they called that the Doom Loop don't they&nbsp;
so the value is falling so they have to sell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.040
it to convert it to cash that makes the&nbsp;
value fall even more so then they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.580
to they need to sell it more and then and the&nbsp;
bank of England's intervention was to try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.360
stop this Doom Loop happening so the bank of&nbsp;
England they have the power to print lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.800
money and they've intervened they've said look if&nbsp;
no one wants to buy these bonds so the the price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.860
is falling what we're going to do is we're&nbsp;
going to buy loads of them that will push up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.260
demand that will push up the price to a point&nbsp;
where these Pension funds aren't in in danger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.840
um makes sense you know if if you're the one&nbsp;
institution that can very easily print money and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.580
intervene in the market I can see why they've done&nbsp;
it is is there a problem here why should we or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
should we be worried that the bank of England has&nbsp;
printed a load of money to buy government bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120
I mean this goes back to the thing I've been&nbsp;
saying a lot whenever I've done media in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.660
last couple of years right which is whenever the&nbsp;
bank of England prints a ton of money especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.140
when it's a lot of money and whenever the&nbsp;
government gives out a lot of money you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.180
be asking where that money is going to end up so&nbsp;
essentially what we have here is a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.620
the government has slashed taxes on rich people&nbsp;
this is after the three years which have seen the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.000
biggest and fastest ever increase in millionaire&nbsp;
and billionaire wealth in the country okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.740
the government has now slashed taxes on them&nbsp;
the market has said well we think that's that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.820
makes you financially unsustainable so we're&nbsp;
basically going to pull a plug on you and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.100
bank of England is basically coming in and funding&nbsp;
it so now you have a situation where the bank of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.120
England is essentially funding a massive cash&nbsp;
transfer from the government to the rich on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.800
back of the biggest ever cash transfer we've ever&nbsp;
seen from the government to the rich and I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.280
to put some numbers on this you know because I&nbsp;
think it's amazing I don't think people realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.980
you know if you were to tax the wealthy enough&nbsp;
now to make them as rich as they were before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.560
covert started you could give every single&nbsp;
adult in the country 12 000 pounds and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.140
is before the energy stimulus which is another&nbsp;
150 billion pounds to the energy companies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.540
before the massive tax cuts for millionaires&nbsp;
so what you're seeing here is a continuation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.060
of a systemic issue where the government&nbsp;
and the Central Bank together are pumping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.920
hundreds of billions of pounds to the rich and&nbsp;
the consequence for Ordinary People is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.640
prices go up and inflation goes up and ordinary&nbsp;
people stand the living decreases you know you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.840
cannot expect to see the fastest ever increase&nbsp;
in inequality in the history of the country and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.920
not see living standards for ordinary people fall&nbsp;
so I really want people to push back against this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.320
and I want your thoughts on the IMF so you&nbsp;
know historically when the IMF have come up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.920
Navara media it'll be to critique them they're&nbsp;
normally you know thought of as an institution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.840
that enforces free market policies on countries&nbsp;
what they normally want to do is cut spending and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.460
IMF programs normally dramatically increase um&nbsp;
inequality especially in in debtor countries so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.500
you might think of Argentina or or Greece or many&nbsp;
countries in in Africa and Asia over the years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.160
why are they suddenly concerned about inequality&nbsp;
why have the IMF released a statement which says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.840
we've got a problem with what quasi quateng has&nbsp;
announced because it will increase inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.120
plainly and simply because people are&nbsp;
looking at what the government is doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.660
now and thinking that is completely insane&nbsp;
it is completely unsustainable you cannot run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.340
massive deficits permanently it's and you know&nbsp;
normally when you see countries try and do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.500
we're on really big deficits for a long term it's&nbsp;
because of some sort of external disaster or some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.180
sort of really serious situation which requires&nbsp;
an immediate stimulus you know for example covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.120
now you've got a government that's trying to do&nbsp;
this purely in the service of given an absolute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.420
ton of money to millionaires I mean I'm talking&nbsp;
to traders in the city and the biggest question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:43.020
here is is what do they think they are doing and&nbsp;
you know we're torn between working out are they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.400
crazy or are they stupid and the IMF is thinking&nbsp;
that you know I've been in markets for a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.840
time I've never seen anything like this I've never&nbsp;
seen anybody tear their countries finances apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.720
for something as ridiculous as a massive injection&nbsp;
of cash to the richest people in the country I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.600
never seen anybody do it and and it's not just me&nbsp;
it's me the IMF it's everybody in the markets just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.640
looking at these guys and asking them what what&nbsp;
are they trying to do it's crazy and what should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.980
happen now I mean I've said the Prime Minister&nbsp;
the chancellor uh you know nowhere to be seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.200
they they seem to be a bit flummoxed it seems&nbsp;
like they're kind of rabbits in headlights they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.300
didn't realize that their announcement on Friday&nbsp;
would cause such a dramatic reaction I mean what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.620
what could they do to stabilize the markets or&nbsp;
are they just gonna you know keep quiet and hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.080
the bank of England sort of does the hard work&nbsp;
for them okay something has to give here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.500
the reason that something has to give is because&nbsp;
in the last week we've seen a massive increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.540
in interest rates and that is going to cause&nbsp;
an enormous increase in the interest rates of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.620
mortgages okay so you know mortgages in the last&nbsp;
years have been pretty low you know people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.900
getting mortgages one and a half two percent in&nbsp;
the next couple of years if if nothing is done to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.720
to deal with this mortgage rates are going to go&nbsp;
up to six seven eight percent it's just completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.400
unsustainable given the level of house prices and&nbsp;
the size of people's mortgages especially young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.120
people who have bought recently who have very&nbsp;
large mortgages there's no way they can afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.100
these on top of the increasing Energy prices&nbsp;
the increase in food prices this is literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.420
going to be another this could be in many cases an&nbsp;
extra one thousand fifteen hundred pounds a month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.540
people don't have that so something has the given&nbsp;
it's very difficult to understand what because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.900
if the government is going to do this and interest&nbsp;
rates will be high like that it's as simple as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.640
that and it's politically unsustainable so either&nbsp;
the government has to back down which you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.180
they're stubbornly saying they won't but I think&nbsp;
it's quite possible in the end they may be forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.220
to or they need to force the central bank to&nbsp;
massively support them to keep interest rates low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.560
despite the fact that inflation is probably going&nbsp;
to be very high so in that case what your problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.260
is is another big increase in inflation a collapse&nbsp;
in the pound so there's no good options here other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.400
than the government backing down and you know we&nbsp;
need to do whatever we can to try and force them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.900
to do that so something's got to give you're in&nbsp;
agreement with the IMF everything's getting very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.880
strange all very topsy-turvy Gary thank you so&nbsp;
much um for your Insight today we'll get you back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.560
on soon I'm sure and everyone in our audience&nbsp;
you can check out Gary's YouTube channel which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.660
we've linked to in the description box below lots&nbsp;
of great explainers a very complicated economics
