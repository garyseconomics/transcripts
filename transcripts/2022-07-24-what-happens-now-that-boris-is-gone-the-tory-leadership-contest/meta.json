  "description": "\"The government caused a \u00a3450 billion problem of inequality that money went to the rich and now they're trying to fix it with just \n\u00a315 billion pounds - 30 times less.\n\nThe amount of money gone from the government to the rich is 30 times more than the amount of money they're giving you to fix it what does that mean well if you try putting a \u00a315 billion pound sticking plaster on a \u00a3450 billion pound wound basically you're not going to fix the problem\n\n and none of the tory leadership candidates and i suspect probably no one in the tory party is serious about fixing that problem if you want to fix that problem you need to start taking serious amounts of money from the rich\"\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE, SHARE & START A CONVERSATION\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\nWEBSITE - https://www.wealtheconomics.org\nTWITTER - @garyseconomics - https://twitter.com/garyseconomics\nFACEBOOK - @garyseconomics - https://www.facebook.com/garyseconomics/\nINSTAGRAM - @garyseconomics - https://www.instagram.com/garyseconomics/\nTIKTOK - @garyseconomics - https://www.tiktok.com/@garyseconomics?lang=en\nYOUTUBE - @garyseconomics - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Ghe5TBQGYIOANuiNW4hDQ\n\n\nPerformed by Gary Stevenson\nGARYSECONOMICS\n\n\nProduced by Simran Mohan\nMOHAN MEDIA",
