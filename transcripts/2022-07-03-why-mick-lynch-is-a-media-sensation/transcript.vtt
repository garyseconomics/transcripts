have got a membership and a trade union that is 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.200
prepared to fight for what we've got. what the rest&nbsp;
of the country suffers from is the lack of power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.880
the lack of the ability to organize and the lack&nbsp;
of the wherewithal to take on these employers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.280
that are continually driving down wages and&nbsp;
making the working class in this country poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.320

and dividends are accelerated and the stock market&nbsp;&nbsp;

is reasonably healthy we've got full employment&nbsp;
tomorrow we've got full employment and falling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.160
wages and that is a situation that has never&nbsp;
happened before and it cannot be tolerated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.280
by working people or by the trade union&nbsp;
movement (BBC news)

the&nbsp;need to ridicule me but i'm just asking&nbsp;you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.380
what you expect your members 
to do if agency workers..

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.440
Mick Lynch: Your questions are verging into the 
nonsense, We will Picket (Sky News)

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.720
Jenny Chapman MP: Actually Mick you don't know 
anything about my&nbsp;background or my community

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.240
or where i come from... so 
Mike Lynch: I can't even see you i don't know who you are

working class or whatever any of those thoughts&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mike: i didn't say you weren't working class
I don't even know your name

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.520
Jo Coburn: well shouldn't you&nbsp;Mick? (BBC Politics Live) 
Mick Lynch: many employers are taking this opportunity

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.480
they're using what is a temporary phenomenon Covid&nbsp;
and the temporary phenomenon of people being told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.960
not to go to work as a smoke screen to get rid&nbsp;
of decent conditions decent pay rates and decent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.560
agreements and nobody in our community should&nbsp;
tolerate that from this government of billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.200
who tell everyone else they've got to tighten&nbsp;
their belts while they're raking it in (Sky News)

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.960
um i was watching that obviously when um when&nbsp;
he was doing this stuff a couple of weeks ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.120
um what what for me as someone who does the&nbsp;
media it's very funny to watch because what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.440
it really highlights um and i think maybe most&nbsp;
people don't really realise this is basically how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.160
many of the people you see on the news:
the&nbsp;presenters, the panellists, the experts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.240
the vast majority of those people do not&nbsp;
have any particularly strong knowledge on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.200
the thing that they're talking about at any given&nbsp;
point in time you know so you saw the presenter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.640
what is it, the sky news presenter Kate Burleigh&nbsp;
is it? She would have just been given&nbsp;like 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.600
a little like flat sheet that morning you&nbsp;know 
and she would have read that with 10 other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.320
stories and i mean she's read like she's probably&nbsp;
done like 10 minutes of reading about that okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.480
and this guy Mick Lynch it's his job right, its&nbsp;his 
life he knows everything about these&nbsp;strikes&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.480
right but it's not just her i&nbsp;don't want 
to like single her out right

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.640
if there's an MP, that MP would have done 
20-30 minutes reading on that thing you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.040
and even when you get like experts who get&nbsp;
called in those experts the kind of ones&nbsp;who go&nbsp;

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.640
on the news they're sort of generic media&nbsp;
commentator experts you know they might have some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.400
broad knowledge in a particular area but&nbsp;
they don't know anything about these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.040
particular strikes so what you actually see&nbsp;
when you watch the news and it's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.520
mad when you think about it is you are watching a&nbsp;
conversation between three or four or five people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.760
talking about an important issue and none of&nbsp;
those people actually has much understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.040
of that issue and what you've had here is this guy&nbsp;
mick lynch who is a complete expert walking in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.360
just being like well that thing's wrong that thing&nbsp;
you said is wrong you're full of nonsense like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.240
this stuff you're talking is just so nonsense&nbsp;
and um it highlights really this absurd situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.280
that we have in the media and the news where the&nbsp;
level of especially in economics i mean economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.760
is the area i'm an expert so i can tell you&nbsp;
with absolute certainty right in economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.480
almost everything you hear on the news above&nbsp;
like absolute basic level of simplicity is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.320
useless you might as well ignore it and often&nbsp;
even the simplest stuff at basic level is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.400
you know if you look at what's happening now with&nbsp;
the cost of living crisis the government gave out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.040
450 billion pounds to the rich unbelievably huge&nbsp;
amount of money - £10,000 per person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.240
so the average rich person is getting&nbsp;
like a £100,000-£200,000 cash

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.200
and that was always obviously going to cause&nbsp;
a crash of inflation then the inflation crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.440
happens and everyone's like oh my god how&nbsp;
did this happen you know that can only happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.120
when you have a system like we have now which is&nbsp;
basically rotten all the way through where every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.240
single person in that system has no understanding&nbsp;
and no level of knowledge right um and i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.080
that is really ultimately the obvious consequence&nbsp;
of this system economic system we've built how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.800
give jobs up which is all the jobs basically go&nbsp;
based on who you know and what your background is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.040
and nobody's actually considering well&nbsp;
should we get some actual genuine experts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.480
you know so this guy Mick Lynch, genuine 
expert knows his stuff, he comes in

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.200
and he can just walk he can just wipe&nbsp;the 
floor with all of these people because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.080
have no idea what's really happening you&nbsp;know 
and uh you know we'll talk about the strikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.640
themselves i think it's important people realise&nbsp;
what's happening you know when the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.960
prints that amount of money effectively what&nbsp;
they're doing is devaluing the currency and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.920
they give it to rich people effectively what they're&nbsp;
doing is massively increasing inequality right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.400
so then you see this situation where the rich&nbsp;
make an enormous amount of money the fastest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.440
ever increase in millionaire billionaire wealth&nbsp;
ever in the country and ordinary people can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.240
afford to pay the bills right and all the&nbsp;
prices go up you know let's let's be clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.840
inflation is coming up to ten percent now and&nbsp;
you know most of the people watching will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.600
have received 10 increases in their pay you know i&nbsp;
think most people will be lucky if they're getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.880
three or four percent that means in real terms&nbsp;
people's pays fall in six percent seven percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.240
at the same time as the billionaires have&nbsp;
never ever ever made more money so it should

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.000
in my opinion never in the history of economics&nbsp;
has it been more obvious what needs to be done you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.840
know the government gave a ton of money to rich&nbsp;
people that is destroying the lives of poor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.600
ordinary people you need to take the money back&nbsp;
from the rich people and use that to support the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.240
lives of poor and ordinary people you know in that&nbsp;
sense we want the same thing but i think more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:33.200
anything what it highlights is that we've created&nbsp;
an economics media which for one of a better term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.040
is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basically and it just takes one guy who&nbsp;
actually knows his stuff to come in and highlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.360
how little these guys know and um you know it's&nbsp;
important that people know what's really happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.400
because what has really happened is really&nbsp;
really hurt more than every people you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.200
that is basically like the mission of this channel&nbsp;
and that's the reason why i decided to start this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.960
channel you know i was writing i was writing&nbsp;
for newspapers and i was appearing in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.360
and i started to realize like you know this is&nbsp;
this is like a room full of idiots and it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.160
a space from which we can actually tell people&nbsp;
what's really happening you know so you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.120
good on Mick Lynch &amp; you know it's nice to see&nbsp;
somebody who i dunno his background but seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.120
to be from an ordinary background coming in with a&nbsp;
genuine knowledge actually being given a platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.680
for once and you know i wish it happened more um&nbsp;
but it highlights you know how bad information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:36.000
people are receiving is and it highlights how&nbsp;
important what we are doing is because i don't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.480
anybody else giving genuine reliable information&nbsp;
about the economy to ordinary people and if people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.160
don't know what's happening people can't stop it&nbsp;
and if we don't stop this it's going to get worse

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.400
at the moment these guys are profiting from a&nbsp;
crisis that is going to keep our economy in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.040
stump for 50 years there is one other thing&nbsp;
they can do with that mass amount of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.840
they can buy your mom's house

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.340
you
