happen anyway
um<00:00:43.739><c> but</c><00:00:43.980><c> well</c><00:00:44.160><c> done</c><00:00:44.340><c> and</c><00:00:44.520><c> I</c><00:00:44.700><c> think</c><00:00:44.760><c> what</c><00:00:45.120><c> we</c>

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
um but well done and I think what we
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.190 align:start position:0%
um but well done and I think what we
should<00:00:45.480><c> add</c>

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
should add
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930 align:start position:0%
should add
inflation<00:00:46.860><c> coming</c><00:00:47.160><c> down</c><00:00:47.340><c> does</c><00:00:47.640><c> not</c><00:00:47.760><c> mean</c>

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
inflation coming down does not mean
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 align:start position:0%
inflation coming down does not mean
prices<00:00:48.180><c> coming</c><00:00:48.539><c> up</c>

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
prices coming up
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.290 align:start position:0%
prices coming up
inflation<00:00:50.160><c> is</c><00:00:50.399><c> the</c><00:00:50.520><c> rate</c><00:00:50.640><c> of</c><00:00:50.820><c> increase</c><00:00:50.940><c> in</c>

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
inflation is the rate of increase in
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.630 align:start position:0%
inflation is the rate of increase in
prices<00:00:51.480><c> so</c><00:00:52.320><c> it</c><00:00:52.440><c> just</c><00:00:52.620><c> means</c><00:00:52.860><c> that</c><00:00:52.920><c> prices</c><00:00:53.160><c> are</c>

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
prices so it just means that prices are
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 align:start position:0%
prices so it just means that prices are
going<00:00:53.760><c> to</c><00:00:53.879><c> stop</c><00:00:54.059><c> going</c><00:00:54.360><c> up</c><00:00:54.600><c> as</c><00:00:55.260><c> fast</c><00:00:55.500><c> as</c><00:00:56.280><c> they</c>

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
going to stop going up as fast as they
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.709 align:start position:0%
going to stop going up as fast as they
were<00:00:56.579><c> so</c><00:00:56.699><c> you</c><00:00:57.059><c> know</c><00:00:57.120><c> it</c><00:00:57.239><c> don't</c><00:00:57.420><c> make</c><00:00:57.600><c> things</c>

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
were so you know it don't make things
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 align:start position:0%
were so you know it don't make things
better
