00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.720
Today we are going to talk about

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.960
if you tax the rich, they’ll leave.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.440
We have done a video on this channel

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.400
about whether it is possible to tax the rich before.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.160
I did it about a year ago.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.280
I went and watched it before I did this video.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.360
And the reason I watched it is

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.160
because we have been getting tons

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.320
and tons and tons of comments,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.520
which is you can't tax the rich they’ll leave.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.040
You can't tax rich they’ll leave.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120
It is by far the most popular comment on the channel.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.600
It's the most frequent criticism

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.840
to whether you should tax the rich.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.760
So I didn't want to do a video

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.000
because we'd already done one before,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
but I went and checked and it's only got 10,000 views.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.640
And obviously since then the channel has grown a lot.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.200
We've got a lot of new people.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.480
This is clearly the number one concern

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.240
about why we cannot tax the rich.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.320
So I wanted to do a video, deal with it head on.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.280
And explain really, really clearly why we can

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.000
tax the rich.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.400
Okay.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.120
So this argument

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
that we cannot tax the rich because they’ll leave

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
is basically based on a confusion

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.520
between rich people who are rich

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.680
because they have a good job

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.400
and they make money from their work,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560
and rich people who are rich

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360
because they own a lot of assets.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.440
Now, ordinary people don't have great visibility

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.560
with regards to extremely wealthy families, families

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.000
who have

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.280
asset hoardings of £10 million, £100 million, £1 billion.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.200
So ordinary people,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.760
when they think of the rich, they tend

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.920
to think of people with good jobs

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.520
doctors, lawyers, bankers, businessmen,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.080
people who might earn 100, 200,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.520
maybe even more thousand pounds a year.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.080
and these people,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.360
if you tax them, in many cases, they can leave.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.200
I was a trader for a long time.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.040
I made a lot of money when I was doing that.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.360
I paid a lot tax,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.920
but if I wanted, I could have gone to work in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.120
most famously Singapore, which has a lower tax rate.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.000
So it's possible for people who

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400
have very high incomes from their work to leave

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160
because they get their money from their work

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.680
and they can work anywhere in a higher

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.960
tax country or a low tax country.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.800
When I talk about taxing the rich,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.480
I'm not talking about these people.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.680
And I want to make it very clear from the start.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.080
I said it a lot of times on the channel,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.760
but I think some people still don't recognise it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.440
when I talk about taxing the rich.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.360
This is not about highly paid workers.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.640
This is about individuals and families

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.880
that have tens

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600
or hundreds of millions of pounds or dollars in assets,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.560
maybe even billions of pounds or dollars in assets.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.560
These are the people I want to tax.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160
Now, when we consider a billionaire

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720
or somebody worth, let's say, £1 billion or £100 million,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.400
they do not get their income

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.960
from working in the vast majority of cases. If you are,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.280
say Rishi Sunak who’s worth £700 million, he owns assets,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.560
he owns assets, this is, he owns buildings,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.520
he owns properties, he owns companies,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200
he owns debt, for example

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.000
he owns your mortgage, he owns the government debt.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.040
This is what rich people own.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040
They get their income as what is considered

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040
passive income.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.240
They get it whether they work or not

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.840
because it doesn't come from the work,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.040
it comes from their assets.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.800
And what this means is it comes essentially from you.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.240
They own your house,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.720
they own the supermarket you shop in,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.160
they own the fields that produce the food that you eat.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400
They own the natural resources

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.800
which produce the electricity you use.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.680
They own the office block that you work in.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.840
They own your mortgage, they own the government debt.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.480
So when you pay taxes, it goes to them.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.600
If you don't understand this concept of what wealth is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600
and what wealth ownership is, I really recommend

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.960
you watch the video on the channel called What is Wealth.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
We also,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.240
I think we're going to put this out the week

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.480
after we do a new video explaining really clearly what wealth is.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.520
So this is the difference

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520
between somebody who works for their money

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.880
and somebody who owns for their money.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960
Working people can leave and work in another country.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.240
But if I own £1 billion

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.640
of UK government bonds or £1 billion of UK property,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.040
regardless of whether I live in the country or not,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.000
that money is coming from you,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.280
when you pay your rent and you when you pay your taxes.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.400
Rich people who are rich,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.160
rich through asset ownership, asset hoarding,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.920
they get their money from you.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.320
So this is the key thing to understand, right?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.240
I'm not talking about taxing working people.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.760
I'm talking about the people that own the assets.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.120
They own the assets of this country.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.200
They own British assets.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.160
They own the land. They own the buildings.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.360
They own the companies. They own the debt.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.520
They own British assets.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.840
So let's talk about these people. Can they leave?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.040
So at the moment

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.400
we have a tax system in this country

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.120
which is common in western countries.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.000
It's same in Western Europe, it's the same in the US,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.680
which taxes you based on where you live.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.800
And what that means is I could go into France

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.360
if I was a billionaire and buy

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.280
€5 billion

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.440
worth of French property of French businesses,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.640
and then I could leave,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.320
I could move to the Cayman Islands,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.160
and I could take loads of French rent payments, French

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.040
mortgage payments,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.080
money from French customers

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.440
and basically pay no tax on it.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.720
Because even though I own half of France

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.360
or half of Britain or half of the US,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.920
I don't live in those countries, so I don't pay tax.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.280
And this is basically,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280
a completely absurd tax system,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.040
which we don't have to use. Not every country does this.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.720
China doesn't

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.840
allow you to own half of China

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.640
and not pay any tax on the money

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.760
that you extract from Chinese people,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.480
because you don't live in China.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.600
Other countries don't allow this.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.440
We do allow this but we don't have to.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.560
The basic fact is,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.360
if you own a tonne of British assets,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.800
be that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.960
companies that sell to British

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.960
consumers, British homes, British debt,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.520
British land, British natural resources,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.760
your money comes from Britain.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.440
And that would be the same if I was talking about the US,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.760
if I was talking about Australia,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.880
if I was talking about Germany or France,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.120
you exist in a country that has real assets.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360
Those assets are owned by somebody.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.280
And whenever you use those assets,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.600
you pay that person and the money comes from you.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.240
So this is the big reason why

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.960
the very richest people in society

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.200
are actually the easiest technically to tax

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.640
is because, if I'm a teacher or a lawyer or a doctor,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.560
I can go to Dubai, I can go to Singapore

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.960
and I can work in those countries

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.400
and I generate the money from my work.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.560
If I'm rich and I own your country,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.040
whether I leave or not, my money still comes from you

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.960
and it's...

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.720
I’m the least mobile person in the world

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.200
from a tax perspective.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600
Because whereas a worker can move

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.200
and work in another country,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.560
the owners of the assets,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.000
they all your country

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.560
and of course your country can decide

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.840
whether to tax them or not.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.240
So I think once you understand this difference,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.000
that taxing the rich,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.720
when I use

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.960
it, is not about taxing working people,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.720
it's about taxing the owners of the wealth.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.160
I think what you can recognise from

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.040
that is the fundamental question we are dealing with here

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.480
is who owns your country?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.080
Who owns the wealth of your country?

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.640
Look around you in the place that you live.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.640
Look around you in the country that you live.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.000
Look at all of the land.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.240
Look at all of the buildings.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240
Look at all of the property.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.240
Look at all of the productive buildings and machinery

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.800
and all of the natural resources.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.840
Somebody owns that.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.960
Who do you want to own it?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400
We are in a state of transition in the West,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.520
where we used to have a large middle class

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.480
that owned a lot of the wealth.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.920
They are losing that

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.080
through increased debt

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.120
and through decreased

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.280
direct ownership of things

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.320
like property, things like the stock market,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.040
which are increasingly being owned by wealthy people.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.760
If you allow the very rich

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.880
to own the wealth in your country,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.800
claim that they don't live in your country

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.440
so that they don't pay tax on your country,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.920
despite the fact

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.120
that all of the people in your country are paying their rent,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.160
are paying their mortgages, are paying company

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.600
profits to these people,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.800
it is inevitable that they will accumulate

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.160
more and more of your country,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
and eventually you will lose your middle class.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.400
And this is the reason that we do

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.760
everything on this channel.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.320
And I think there's a kind of absurd thing

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.800
that happens here where,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.960
I say tax the rich to protect the workers.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.920
And very,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.520
very rich people pay a lot of money

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.440
to pay a lot of people to tell you,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.040
Gary wants to tax you.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.840
The reality is,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.480
unless you're a very rich person,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.280
if you are part of the middle class

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.360
or even poorer than the middle class in your country,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.080
you are losing your assets to the rich.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.280
And the rich are not paying tax.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.360
And I really think we need to start viewing tax

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.280
really, in the same way that we view an army.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.520
The reason that countries have armies is to stop

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.560
foreign invaders from coming in

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.680
and taking all of the land and taking all of the assets.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.360
That is happening.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.400
It is happening now.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.520
The middle class are losing their assets to the rich.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.040
We can see that in decreased homeownership rates,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.240
in more increased ownership of the stock market,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.800
in much higher levels of debt from ordinary families

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.400
and from governments to the rich.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.360
You are losing your assets.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.440
You are losing your assets

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.600
and you are competing with people

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.080
like Rishi Sunak, who have passive incomes

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.360
of £1 million a week,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.240
and there is no way for you to compete with them.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.000
What they own is your assets.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
They own your house.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.720
They own the building you work in.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.080
They own the building you shop in.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.960
They own the bar.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.440
They own the restaurants. They own the natural resources.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.760
All of those things exist in your country.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.480
They exist in your country, and you can tax them.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.400
We don't tax them because in many cases

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.840
we have a very, very wealthy political class

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
that is funded by them

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.360
and just simply told you that we can't, but we can.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.240
We can.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.040
China does it.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.600
Lots of countries have done it in the past,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.560
but at the moment we have...

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.600
basically, I would argue there’s

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.440
a degree of political capture,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.560
where the very rich not only influence

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.160
the politicians to not tax them, but to tax you instead,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.440
but they also influence the media and the economists

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.960
to tell you that it's impossible to tax them.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.880
Listen, these guys are not magicians.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.400
They can leave the country.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.040
The assets are here. We don't need them.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.840
We need their assets.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.000
It's about ownership of the assets.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.200
It's about ownership of the country you live in.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.480
Now, I want to be clear

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.800
when I say that it's possible to tax them.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.280
That is 100% true because we don't need...

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.280
These are people who don't want we don't need the labour.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.800
What we need is their assets.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.240
The assets

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.760
exist in this country

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.880
or in the country, in the West where we live,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.960
we can tax them.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.200
That doesn't mean it's going to be easy.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.880
I don't think it's easy.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.840
I think it's going to be really, really hard.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.840
But I don't do it because it's easy.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.240
I do it because I think it's important

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.080
that my country and your country, whichever country is,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.040
doesn't collapse into desperate poverty.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.320
And the only way to protect the middle class

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.720
and the poor from the rich is taxation.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.280
Just like the only way to protect you from

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.080
foreign armies is an army.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.800
We don't have the taxation,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.920
and we are moving back towards being a very unequal,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.800
very high poverty society.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.880
I campaign for taxation of the rich.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.120
Not because it is easy, but because it is essential.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:56.560
And, we are going to move into a period now

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.720
where we have a change of government in this country.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.400
And if I'm totally honest,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.600
I think that the previous government,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.760
you know,

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.640
the Prime Minister is worth £700 million,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.080
David Cameron made £10 million

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.640
in a year of leaving office.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.320
They all went to the most elite private schools

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.760
and come from wealthy families.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.680
I think that that government

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.400
was basically aggressively

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.640
protecting the class interests of the rich.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.920
And, I don't think they ever would have given us

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.040
what we need in terms of stopping

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.200
the increases in inequality.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.920
But we're going to move now into a period

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.200
of having a government which, rather than saying

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.280
we don't want to stop inequality increasing,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.560
they will be saying it would be nice

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.120
to stop inequality increasing,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.360
but it's not practical

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.160
or it's not sensible or it's too difficult

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.520
or it's not worth the effort.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.640
Personally, I think it is worth the effort to stop

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.680
your societies from collapsing into desperate poverty.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.400
and it's not easy, but it's essential.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.720
And I think sometimes it's important

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.920
for people to try to do things that are difficult

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.320
because they are essential

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.520
to stop the collapses of their societies.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.360
And previous generations did things like that.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.760
And it is through the work of those previous generations

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.920
that I live in a country

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.600
which for a long time provided decent living standards

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.040
and housing and education

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.480
and healthcare to ordinary people.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.560
That's not normal.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.520
In most of the world

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.200
ordinary people don't get good quality

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.920
housing and education and healthcare and leisure time.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.200
But we had it here in the UK and we had it in the US

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.600
and in Europe and Australia and Japan

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.040
for 50, 60 years

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.240
because people fought for it,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.120
despite the fact that before they had it,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.200
it had never happened before in modern society.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.440
Taxing the rich will be very, very difficult.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.880
It's possible these people are not magicians.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.560
These people are not Gandalf.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.040
They can't magic themselves

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.440
out of the country and disappear

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.120
all of the wealth out of the country.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.640
The wealth is here. It is the wealth of our countries.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.600
But if we allow it to be held

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.920
by a small group of extremely wealthy families

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.720
who pretend they live

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.040
in the Cayman Islands and pay no tax,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.680
then we and our kids

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.640
and our grandkids will live in poverty.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.920
So it's difficult, but it's possible.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.840
I want to do it.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.440
I'm going to keep campaigning for it

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.440
and I hope you support us on this channel.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.200
This is the big question we can ask all the time.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200
Can we tax the rich?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.160
Okay, it's not about working people.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.880
It's about the people who are hoarding our assets

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.360
and stealing our countries. The assets are here.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.400
The wealth is here. We can tax it. Thank you.
