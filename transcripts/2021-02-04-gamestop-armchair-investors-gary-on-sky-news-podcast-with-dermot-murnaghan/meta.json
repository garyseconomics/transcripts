Last week, armchair investors, armed with easy-to-use trading apps, used social media to drive up the share prices that multiple billion-dollar hedge funds had bet against. GameStop share prices rose over 1000%, and with that, hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citron Research lost an estimated total of $19 billion.\n\nBut what actually happened to cause such a massive hit to Wall Street? And why does this matter?\n\nSky News Daily podcast host, Dermot Murnaghan speaks to economist and former trader, Gary Stevenson about why this stock market volatility could be a symptom of an unequal society.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\nWEBSITE - https://www.wealtheconomics.org\nTWITTER - @garyseconomics\nFACEBOOK - garyseconomics\nINSTAGRAM - garyseconomics\n\n\nGARY'S ARTICLES:\nhttps://www-express-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1310681/coronavirus-crisis-higher-taxes-open-letter-government/amp?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASDYAQE%3D#aoh=15953698215440&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fcomment%2Fexpresscomment%2F1310681%2Fcoronavirus-crisis-higher-taxes-open-letter-government\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/i-made-millions-last-debt-crisis-rich-win-coronavirus-fair-tax?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588851954\nhttps://www.cityam.com/debate-is-there-any-point-in-members-of-the-wealthy-elite-calling-for-higher-taxes-in-response-to-covid-19/\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/following-coronavirus-money-trail/\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/i-made-a-fortune-from-predicting-the-last-crisis-i-fear-for-whats-about-to-unfold/\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/05/22/analysis/whats-making-rich-stupidly-richer?fbclid=IwAR0cV436I5FEzNvpDp2WKqMho5-2rmYJnfef7T6vzYw_pyNy5usoeArTLWg\n\n\nMORE VIDEOS:\nCOVID-19 MONEYFLOW THEORY - https://youtu.be/EiblHqbpXHs\nCOVID-19 RICH GETTING RICHER - https://youtu.be/1YrDt8z0dKE\n\n\n\nSTOCK FROM:\nMedia Modifier on Pixabay\nGerd Altmann on Pixabay\nFelix Br\u00f6nnimann on ?\n\n\nSpoken by Dermot Murnaghan\nSKY NEWS\n\n\nProduced by Annie Joyce\nSKY NEWS\n\n\nSpoken by Gary Stevenson\nGARY'S ECONOMICS\n\n\nUploaded by Simran Mohan \nMOHAN MEDIA",
