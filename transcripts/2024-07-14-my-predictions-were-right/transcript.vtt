00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Okay. Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.800
Today we are celebrating the four year
anniversary of this channel

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.840
by rewatching our very first video

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.280
All right, so we're going to put this out
in the middle of July.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.480
I started this channel with my mate

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.800
Simran on July 14th,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480
2020.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.640
And the first video we did on
the channel was basically a video

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.040
which explained how the money being

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.480
given out by governments during COVID
was going to end up with the rich.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.880
How it was going to lead
to a massive increase in inequality

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.520
and how it was going to cause a massive
financial crisis.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.440
You know, back at the time,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.000
at the beginning of COVID,
I became really obsessed with this idea

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.160
that COVID was going to cause inequality
and it's going to cause an economic crisis

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.280
and I was writing articles for newspapers
and things like this, and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.760
I really wanted to start a YouTube

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.000
because I wanted to be like, send
this message directly to ordinary people.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.120
And I used to chat on my school
WhatsApp chat to my friends, like,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.560
I'm getting really pissed off
writing for newspapers

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
ordinary people are not seeing it.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.400
So I want to start YouTube.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
But you know,
I don't know anything about videos.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.720
So I was really lucky.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.400
A friend of mine called Simran messaged
me and said, you know, I've got a camera.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Just come to my place and we’ll
shoot a video and start a YouTube channel.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.680
So that was four years ago.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
We made this video
and I thought for the four year

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.840
anniversary of the channel,
it'd be nice to go through it.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.600
I still remain convinced that this money

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.880
given out during COVID is what's driven
the fall in living standards.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.680
And I talk about it
a lot in a lot of my videos.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.360
The government's given out £900
billion, it’s ended up with the rich.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.280
That's increasing inequality.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.840
And people sometimes ask you know,
how did that money end up with the rich?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.080
And obviously,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.680
people who have come to the channel more
recently, haven't seen the first video.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.480
So I thought it would be nice
for the four year anniversary

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.840
to do something a little bit different
and to go through together

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.960
that first video on
the channel. So you can see

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.520
how the channel started off.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.600
The predictions I made back
then at the beginning of COVID.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.280
And yeah, have a bit fun as well.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
So let's get started.
Let's watch this video.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.360
This video is about coronavirus and money.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, this is a really important video

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.760
I've been wanting to make it
for a long time because

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.480
huge, huge, historic things are happening
in the world of money.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.240
So this is the opening of the video.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.360
We're really lucky
Simran had like a big white wall

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.840
behind him in his in his front room
which we could shoot in front of.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.720
And we wanted to shoot there
so we could do some animations,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.040
which we’ll see the animations come in.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.880
First thing is, we messed
the audio up really badly.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.280
We forgot to turn the lav mic on.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.080
So this is just camera only audio.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
You can see
the audio quality is quite bad.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.040
Secondly, you can tell I'm
really pumped up and excited

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.880
because I'm talking a little bit
more ghetto than usual,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880
which is which is what happens
when I get very emotional

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920
When I was working as a money trader

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.720
in the 2008 crisis,
nothing ever happened of this speed.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800
That's me just very briefly mentioning
I was a trader.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.000
I actually wanted to do this whole video
without talking about that.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.240
So we'll see if I mention it again.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.480
What’s happening in the world of money
here is going to dominate the economy

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.520
for the next few years,
quite possibly within a few decades.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600
It's going to affect you, going to affect
your family's financial position.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120
So if you want to understand
what's going to happen in the economy

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.960
going forward, you gotta watch this video.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.440
people complained a lot
that I was clapping my hands too much.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.440
I was emotional.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.000
Now, so far in this crisis.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.360
Most workers have had their incomes
relatively protected.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.200
In this country,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.520
the UK. Most workers are still working
and getting their regular incomes.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.720
Of those who can't work.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.440
The majority are being supported
by government

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.440
furlough and self-employment schemes.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.680
Now, as many as five
and a half million workers are falling

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.680
through the gaps of those schemes
and are getting almost no income support.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.720
Now, those guys already are feeling
the pain of this financial crisis.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.760
But what we're going to explain in
this video is how

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.840
even if your income is being supported,
the change in the world of money

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.440
behind the scenes are going to affect
your financial position going forward.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.760
Man I'm talking really quickly,
this video,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.680
I think I was erm,
I had a lot I wanted to say.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.080
I was really

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.360
worried about what was going to happen
with this money,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.200
where it's going to end up
and this funny thing happens where

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.800
you've kind of semi scripted
the video in your head

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.720
and you’re just trying to get out
really, really quickly.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.640
But yeah, just to make the ideas clear,
you know, we knew government's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.360
going to give a ton of money out
and my background

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.920
is and was as an inequality economist.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.960
So I really wanted to know who's
going to end up with that money.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960
And we're going to go
through the logic of it.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.080
Now the biggest changes
have been happening

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.240
in the world of government
and central banks.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.360
couple of good photographs there.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.280
That I went and took for the video
Now, this is happening all over the world.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.280
But in the UK, the central bank,
the Bank of England

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.840
has committed to printing £300 billion
So that was the initial amount.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
That was the initial amount.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.120
I think something happened
which confused a lot of people here,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680
which was governments
ran a £300 billion deficit,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.680
which means governments gave out
£300 billion UK government

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.160
and at the same time the central bank,
the Bank of England did 300 billion QE.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.040
I think these numbers
get confused a little bit.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.720
The best way to

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.520
understand it is that the central bank
printed 300 billion.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600
They gave it to the government
and the government gave it out.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.200
There's two separate

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.400
numbers here, which is the amount

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.280
of quantitative easing,
which is the amount of money

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.760
printed by the central bank and given
to the government and the deficit.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.480
I think the deficit is more important.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.320
But at this point
the two numbers were the same.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.360
So that 300 billion, if we consider
the deficit, is now 900 billion,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880
it ended up being much, much more.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.760
But the beginning of COVID,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.200
we knew 300 billion
was the amount that we knew at the time.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280
£300 billion.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.400
It's an enormous amount of money.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.520
It is a massive amount

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.440
It's four and a half thousand pounds
for every single man, woman

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.160
and child in the country.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.160
900 billion is obviously three times that.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.840
It's more than three times the net worth
of Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.920
Just to clear things up a little bit.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160
That three and a half thousand pounds
is man, woman and child.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.960
Recently, I use more amount per adult.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.440
So 900 billion, which is the current
amount, is about £19,000 per adult.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.280
That's the total government deficit
since the beginning of COVID.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.880
Now, when such a huge amount of money,
gets printed and put into the economy,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.880
its really important
we understand three things about it.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.400
One, how does it work?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400
So we're going to talk about
exactly what money printing is.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.040
Where does the money go?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.280
And three, where does the money end up?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.400
Now, those last two things,
they may sound similar,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.960
but they're actually crucially different.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.840
I'm going to explain why Okay.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840
So number one,
how does this new money work?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.840
So I think a lot of people are confused
by the concept of money printing.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.720
It's important to understand
that this £300 billion is brand new money

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.600
created by the central bank.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.400
Now, if that's confusing to you,
you just need to understand

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.240
that the central bank has the legal right
to print or create brand new money.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.200
Now we say print money to

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.200
give the visual idea of a printing press
printing out new banknotes.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.320
But in reality, nowadays,
most money is electronic.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.080
So what that means in practice
is that the Bank of England is allowed

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.800
to simply credit its own account
with new money.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.440
Some good visuals there.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.040
Again,
this is a slightly confusing idea here,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.920
which is first the central bank prints it,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.160
then the central bank
lend it to government,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.680
then the government gives it out.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.040
Since this video, the picture

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.040
has been complicated a little bit
by the fact that

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.880
government deficits now.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.560
So money which government gives out above
and beyond taxation,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.080
is no longer funded by printing.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.080
So the initial COVID government deficits

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.480
were essentially funded by printing money.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.960
But since then it's largely been funded

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.280
by borrowing money from the rich.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.240
In both cases, somebody gets richer.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.240
If I print money and give it to society,
somebody gets richer.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.720
If I borrow money and give it to society,
somebody gets richer as well.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.560
I think the best way to understand
it is Imagine you have £100

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.640
and I borrowed £100 from you,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.560
so now I owe you £100.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.480
And then I give

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480
the hundred pounds back to you,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.400
but not as a repayment of the debt,
just as a gift.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.560
You now have £100 and your owed £100,
so you get rich either way.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.400
So there's two kinds of government

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.640
deficit here
which sometimes confuse people a bit.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.040
One is funded by

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.880
central bank
printing, one is funded by borrowing.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.040
But in both cases, the government gets
poorer and somebody somewhere gets richer.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.160
And further into this video we're going
to discuss who it is who gets richer.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.840
Okay, so this is brand new money.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.200
It doesn't come from anyone.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.480
It's not raised through taxes.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.200
It's simply
created by the Bank of England.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.200
When that money gets poured
into the system, we need to understand

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.560
who's going to get it.
And the next question.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.200
Where does it go?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.160
this, you know,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.560
this is a really good analysis
by young Gary.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.760
You know,
I was amazed at the beginning of COVID.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.240
We knew enormous amounts of money
were going to be poured into the economy

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.720
by the government.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.160
We knew
the government would be impoverished.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.720
We knew somebody would get richer.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.400
I was amazed, and I still am amazed today
how little discussion

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.680
there was at the time
and how little discussion has been since

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.760
of who has gotten richer
as a result of those deficits.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.560
So the young Gary
is asking the right question.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.400
Now, most of this money is getting lent
from the Bank of England

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.480
to the government.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.120
Now, even though this is brand
newly created money

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.760
and the Bank of England is a government
institution,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.480
the government still has to borrow it
from the Bank of England.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.960
This creates a debt which legally
the government has to pay back.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.000
and we're still talking about that
government debt today.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.880
Obviously,
it's affecting government spending.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.400
So this reason government

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.360
debt has increased hugely already
in this crisis and just recently UK

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.600
government debt has gone above 100% of GDP
for the first time in over 50 years.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.320
That was partially
because GDP fell because of COVID. But

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.920
government debt

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.680
is still so much, much higher than it was
before COVID.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.120
So what does the government then
do with this money?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.200
Well, the government gives most of it
to furloughed workers and other workers

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.840
who can't get their income
during the coronavirus crisis.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.520
This brings us to part three.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.160
Where does the money end up?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.920
Now we know the money is being paid
to furloughed workers.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.840
But if we look at the actual situation
of furloughed workers,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.840
they're actually receiving less income
than they were before the crisis happened.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.520
This is really, really important.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.680
People still to
this day will post my videos

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.920
and say all of that money
the government gave out,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.600
it went to nurses,
it went to furloughed workers.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.800
It went to, you know,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.960
how can you criticize that?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.800
It's the furloughed workers.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.040
But the money went in the first case
to the furloughed workers.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.160
But furloughed workers
don't get richer, right?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.120
This is the thing that

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.040
I was really thinking
a lot about early COVID.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.600
So, yes.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.160
And I think I'll probably say this
in a video. Yes.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.600
The furloughed workers
get the money in the first instance,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.480
but they’re
not the people who end up getting richer.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.920
This is because even though
they're receiving government

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.640
income support,
it's only 80% of their original wages

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.720
and their original wages
are no longer coming in.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.280
So this creates a mystery.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.280
We know that a lot of new money
is coming into the economy,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.320
and we know that ultimately it's
going to the furloughed workers.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.520
But the furloughed workers
are no richer than they were before.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.760
So where's the money going?

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.200
Good analysis.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.680
Good. It's a good question.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.600
That brings us to question number three.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.280
Where does the money end up?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.040
Now we know the money is being paid
to the furloughed workers,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.160
but the furloughed workers

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
have less money than they had
before the coronavirus crisis

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.600
because they've lost the wages
that they were originally being paid.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.840
If we want to know
who ends up with the money,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.760
we need to find out who has those wages.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.760
Where have the wages gone
that used to be paid to the workers.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.840
So if you want to understand,
we have to follow this cash flow back

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.240
through the system.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.480
Now, normally wages get paid
to the workers through the companies.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.160
But if we took the companies,
we'll find that most of these companies

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.600
are struggling as well,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.080
because customers have simply stopped
coming to their stores

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.560
and stopped buying their stuff.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.520
So we need to follow the cash flow back
one step further to the customers.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.400
Now, the customers in this crisis

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.960
have dropped their spending massively
So this is a good analysis, right?

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.480
The money,
the furloughed money goes to workers,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.720
but they’re not getting richer
because they're not getting their wages.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800
So who has the wages?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.480
The companies that employ them.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.360
So are the companies getting richer?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.360
No, they're not
because they've been shut down.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.040
So they're no longer
getting their normal revenues.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.480
So who has the revenues
that used to go to the companies

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.560
that used to pay the wages or the photo,
the workers?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.560
That's the customers.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.960
This is really, this is really good logic
and it really explains

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.200
how the the end

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.680
benefitors of the COVID deficit

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.680
and the deficits we’ve had
since are ultimately the customers.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.880
For that reason.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.120
Many of these customers
are holding more money in their pockets.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.640
That money is not going to the companies,
which means the wages have stopped.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.480
So the people who are holding more money,
the net benefitors

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.640
of the new money being put into
the system are actually the customers.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.080
Now, when I say that,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.040
you're probably thinking,
wait a minute, I'm a customer.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.760
Where's my £4,500
per man, woman and child?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.640
And that would be a good question.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.160
The reason why you might not be holding
£4,500 more than you were before

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.240
is because not
all customers are created equal.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.680
Remember
the reason that customers have more money

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.440
now than they had before the crisis
is because they've cut their spending.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.520
But it's not all spending
that has cut here.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.400
Spending on essentials
such as rent, mortgage, food and bills

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.080
still has to be paid.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.480
So if most of your spending
is on those essentials,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.520
you're spending won’t have fallen by much.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.760
The spending that has fallen
is on non-essentials and luxuries.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.560
So see here, the customers
who are saving the most money...

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.720
I pull a really great pose there
when I say, “see here”...

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.720
Again, this is good analysis, right?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.320
Customers save money,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.560
but it's not all customers
because ordinary families

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.840
are still spending
just like they were before.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.840
It's only richer people
who have a lot of luxury spending,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.520
their spending collapsed during COVID.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.240
So these are the guys that accumulated
the money are the ones who have very high

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.240
spending on non-essentials and luxuries.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.640
Well, you're probably starting
to see where I'm going with this.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.720
Who spends a lot of money on luxuries.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.080
The customers who are accumulating money
during this crisis are the rich.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.440
This is a good conclusion,
correct conclusion.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.360
Good analysis.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.760
Now, I wrote an article
predicting this back in March

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.920
explaining how rich people,
because they would cut

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.720
their spending, would accumulate savings
and money during this crisis.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.960
Gary’s
that proudly predicted it in advance.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.920
Since then, data

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.960
has come out from a lot of institutions,
including the IPPR in the UK,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.280
demonstrating clearly that rich people
have been accumulating money

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.560
during this crisis because their spending
has reduced so much.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.960
There’s a good story here.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.360
I wrote this article for a website
called openDemocracy

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.800
in March 2020, and then I wrote
for The Guardian shortly afterwards.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.880
And somebody from the IPPR contacting me
saying, oh that's interesting.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.960
And I was like screaming at her,
“why aren’t you guys doing this analysis?”

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.440
How could you allow the government
to give out £300 billion

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.080
and not do any analysis
of where the money is ending up.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.720
So I haven’t mentioned in the video.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.120
But the reason the IPPR did that
analysis was because of my first article.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.200
It's interesting to compare the situation
of a furloughed worker

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.280
with a richer person in the economy.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.600
Furloughed workers have lost their income,
which comes from services jobs,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.800
but they've kept most of their spending,
which is largely on essentials

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.520
like rent and bills.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.600
Richer workers who tend to work in office
jobs and can work from home

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.960
have kept their incomes.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960
Whereas their spending, which is largely
on luxuries, has collapsed.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.840
That's quite interesting.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.400
Everybody thinks the furloughed workers
are getting the money,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.880
but if you look at furloughed workers,
they're poorer than they were before.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.160
The people who are actually getting richer
are rich people

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.040
because they've kept their income,
lost their expenditure.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.400
And nobody was saying this
at the time, really.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.520
And I think even now,
there's not really enough discussion

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.880
of, you know, how much richer
rich people got during that period.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.360
It's important to understand

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.600
the significance it has on the economy,
when the rich people stop spending.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.760
Now, in normal times,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.560
rich people have very high spending much
higher than ordinary workers,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.600
because that spending goes to companies
which employ workers.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.440
It contributes to wages being paid.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.200
This is really important
because ordinary workers

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.080
have to pay bills, rent, food.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
When they pay that money,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.640
a lot of that money ends up
going to the owners of the houses

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.840
and owners of the corporations
who are themselves, the rich.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.240
Owners of the mortgages as well.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.200
Some good,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200
some good

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.880
animations, some good animation work
there from Simran.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.640
We actually stopped doing animations
after this video because they increase

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.480
the time it took us to make
the videos so much, but they are good.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.200
I’d love to do more.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.280
If we had like, if we had more money

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.600
to put in the channel,
we would do more animation on the videos.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.640
So as you can see in this diagram,
in a normal situation,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.760
the spending of the rich goes
to the workers.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.000
And when the workers pay their rent,
bills and food, it goes back to the rich.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.760
Some good class analysis there.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.960
The money flows around in a circle.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.840
So what happens when the rich suddenly
stop spending?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.080
Well, that money was driving the wages
for ordinary workers.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.400
Suddenly,
the workers wages have disappeared,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.000
but they still have to pay the rent.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.320
They have to pay the mortgage.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.200
They still have to pay the bills.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.880
How are they going to do that
with no income?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.040
It's a massive problem.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.200
And if nothing happens, some of these
guys, they could become homeless.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.640
They could even
not even get food on the table.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.480
So it's no surprise
that in this emergency situation,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.080
the government and the Bank of England
stepped in with the furlough scheme.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.920
This provides a substitute
income to ordinary workers

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.720
who have lost their wages.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.520
It's important to realize that
at this point, from the perspective

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.680
of the worker, things actually
look quite similar to pre-crisis.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.120
They've got income,
they've got their expenditure,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.440
their incomes a little bit less.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.920
They have to save a little bit.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.960
But from their perspective,
the situation is largely unchanged.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.040
But look at what is happening
outside of the system.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.400
It's really interesting.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.600
You're
an ordinary worker, you've lost your wage,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.440
but you're getting this money
from the government.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.880
You just think everything's
kind of the same.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.880
You lost one income,
you gained another income.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.040
But the money, government money
is flowing through workers to the rich

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.640
and government is accumulating debt
and and the rich are accumulating money.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.880
It's kind of like a massive money
laundering scheme.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.240
Where the government is
just, money is funneled

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.120
from the government
to the rich through ordinary workers.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.520
And nobody, ordinary people
didn't realize it was happening.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.920
Kind of crazy.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.760
And it was obvious once you did this
analysis and it's amazing nobody did it.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.920
That behind the scenes,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.800
inequality would be increasing
enormously during that period.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.000
Previously,
the money was going round in a circle.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.320
What's happening now?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.840
The money gets printed
by the Bank of England.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.480
It goes to the worker.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.880
The worker pays their bills.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.760
It goes to the rich. And then

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.480
it just stays

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.640
there because the rich
are not spending their money anymore.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.040
I must have said the wrong word there
and we tried to overdub it.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.280
It sounds ridiculous, but we did our best.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.160
That means money piles up
with the rich and accumulates.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.920
And what happens with the government?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.920
They accumulate debt.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.680
This is such an important thing
to understand.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.000
Such an important thing to understand.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.640
During COVID, the government
accumulated an enormous amount of debt

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.000
and the rich have the income
on the other side of that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.520
We often talk about the debt
as if it's just, you know, like a

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.880
it's kind of a conceptual evil of 
the debt is owed to the rich.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.920
The government debt has increased

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.920
in proportion to the cash holdings
by the rich.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.040
Okay.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.920
So we've learned that
during the COVID crisis,

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.880
most people's financial situation
appears relatively unchanged.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.000
However, behind the scenes,
the government is accumulating

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.600
big piles of debt and the rich
are accumulating big piles of money.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.640
The next question is

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.440
why does that matter?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.080
Well, the easier part of that question

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.280
is to talk about why big government debt
could affect you.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.840
Those of you
who are old enough to remember 2008

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.720
will remember at that time
too, government debt increased

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.040
and the government came in
and used that to enforce austerity.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.040
My favorite guys, David
Cameron, George Osborne.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.240
Now, that impacted a lot of people.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.720
It had a lot of effects in many,
many different ways

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.040
that could happen again
if government debt increased again.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.560
It's a good prediction.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.520
It's a good prediction.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.280
Government debt has increased massively
and now we're in a situation where,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.000
you know, increasingly having austerity
forced upon us

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.480
because the government basically
gave a ton of money to rich people.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.560
Now, I'm not a politician.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.960
I'm not a political forecaster.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.640
I'm an economic forecaster.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.000
I can't tell you
if austerity will happen again.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.560
It is happening again.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.760
But what I want to talk about
is those big piles of money

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.600
stacking up in rich people's
bank accounts.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.400
It's a good question
because everybody talks about the increase

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.240
in government debt, but nobody ever talks
about this massive increase

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.080
in cash accumulation by the rich,
which I think is arguably more

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.560
important and more damaging.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.840
How is that going to affect you?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.160
So what does it mean
if the rich get richer?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.840
I mean, if they just stack the money
in their bank account,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.360
it's probably not a problem right?

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.720
Personally, I worked in the finance
industry for a long time.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.360
I managed money for the rich.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.240
I got involved in understanding
how they invest their money.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.840
Through that, I made some money myself.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.800
I got involved in investing myself.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.560
I know a little bit about what
the rich do when money starts

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.800
piling up in their bank account.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.480
so I didn't mention I was a trader.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.480
Number one, they buy houses.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.200
But it's not just houses they buy.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.720
I want to be clear at this point in time,
The Guardian were predicting

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.800
and a lot of the media predicting that
because of the weak economy,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.000
house prices would collapse.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.600
So this is a very good prediction
because house prices

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.480
have gone up a lot since July 2020.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.640
When this came out.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.400
They buy stocks.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.040
They buy shares. They buy bonds.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.240
Stock prices are an all time high
in basically every country in the world

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.920
again, Gold prices
hit a new all time high.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.520
I actually put a massive
bet specifically on the gold price

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.360
a few months before this video.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.560
I bought gold, at I think 1470

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.600
or 1460 an ounce and it's 2300 now.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.440
It's gone up massively.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.640
What's that like, 60, 70%?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.040
To be honest, they buy everything.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.560
Now, let's look at what happened last time

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.560
the government used money
printing to solve a financial crisis.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.680
We can look back to the 2008 crisis.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.600
In many ways that was similar.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.040
That time too, the Bank of England

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.280
printed a huge amount of money
to try and deal with an economic crisis.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.720
What happened then?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.160
Well, within six years,
stock prices in London had doubled.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.160
It’s happened again.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.360
Within three years, the gold price was up
150%.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:05.120
It's not quite 150, but it's gone up
well in pounds, maybe 70, 80%.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.960
These are very good predictions
and very monetizable predictions.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.560
You know, it’s not easy to do that.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.320
And within ten years of the crisis, London
house prices had doubled.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.120
That will happen again.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.880
What does that mean?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.640
Well, in the 20 years since 2000,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.400
through that period of crisis
and rising house prices,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.080
the percentage of young people
who've been able

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.240
to afford a home in
this country has fallen from 65 to 27%.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.320
That will continue to fall, definitely.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.440
What will it mean
if house prices double again?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.880
It will mean that realistically,

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.880
people who are from a family
that doesn't have a home now

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.160
will probably never own housing.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.880
This is obviously continuing to happen.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.520
It means that those people will be locked
out of the housing market forever.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.600
It means that young people
find it more difficult

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.080
to get the security
of a home, to raise a family.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.680
And at the same

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.680
time as that is happening,
stock prices are going to go up.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.520
Gold prices are going to go up.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.520
The rich are going to get richer than ever
before.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.160
I don't want to big myself up
too much here, but

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.960
nobody was saying
these things at the time.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.600
And this is a succession of extremely
accurate predictions made four years ago

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.320
But it's not just stocks and shares and
housing that these guys are going to buy.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.120
They'll be in the shops too,
and they’ll have a lot more money

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.120
to push those prices up.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.080
I don't think I need to comment
on the accuracy of that prediction.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.400
It's very likely that over
the next few years,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.520
we're going to see the prices
of a lot of things increase.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.480
He's pretty good.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.680
He's pretty good this guy.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.680
At the same time,
what's going to happen to wages?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.720
Well, we've already seen the unemployment
rate double in this country,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.080
This is the first prediction.
I've watched this before.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.360
This is the only prediction

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.040
which was not really accurate
in this video and we'll talk about it.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.360
and that's in spite of a furlough scheme
encouraging firms to keep jobs on.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.680
There's currently 9 million workers
on that furlough scheme.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.320
And when that starts to be wrapped up,
a lot of those workers

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.920
will probably be pushed into unemployment.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.280
So at the time I made these,
people will not remember this now.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.560
At the time
I made this video in summer 2020.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.960
The furlough scheme was due to end

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.200
before lockdown ended, which

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.200
was obviously an insane policy.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.600
And what you kind of see here
is my naivete as an economic forecaster

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.000
rather than a political forecaster.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.920
It probably should have been obvious
at the time that they would have

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.720
had to extend furlough,
but I've just got my kind of economics

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.800
maths brain on, which is
if you end furlough before you end

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.360
lockdown, you're going to see
a massive spike in unemployment.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.280
But of course, we know now in hindsight,
furlough was extended for years,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.600
which at the time people
people didn’t know it was going to happen.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.600
But clearly, I didn't anticipate that

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.240
With unemployment going up and up and up.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.440
It's very likely that just as house
prices and prices in the shops are rising,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.240
wages will stay low.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.520
I mean, that's pretty consistent.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.360
You know, wages have definitely not kept
track with shop prices or house prices.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.560
That’s definitely correct.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.920
Okay, so what can we do?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.920
We know that under the current situation,
the rich are going to get richer

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.800
while wages fall, house prices
rise and shop prices increase.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.760
It's going to make housing unaffordable
and it's going to drop living conditions

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.880
for regular people.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.960
it's bad grammar, drop living conditions.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.560
It's a big problem of mine, bad grammar.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.520
Well, personally, I think that it can

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.200
if you go back and look at this slide
explaining the problem.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.400
We can see what's happened.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.920
Money currently is flowing
from the government to the rich,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.240
leaving government with big piles of debt
and the rich with big piles of money.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.560
We can actually fix this
with one single arrow in this diagram.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.200
If we start money moving

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.320
back around the system away from the rich,
no more cash piles to the rich.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.800
No more debt for the government.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.000
In my opinion, we need to find ways to tax
the truly rich in our society

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.720
by taxing wealth rather than just income.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.720
It's good analysis and it's amazing
fewer people are making this point.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.200
You know, in the last five years,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.640
the wealth of the richest has exploded,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.880
Government debt has exploded

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.400
as a pretty obvious result of

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.640
these furlough and these COVID policies.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.840
You can reverse that if you tax the rich.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.000
You know, it's amazing that 
we don't do it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.880
And here you see me
just trying to make it clear

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.840
when I say we tax
the rich, we're not talking about

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.120
necessarily high wage earners.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.960
We're talking
about extremely wealthy families,

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.240
which is something
I continue to say to this day.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.920
This will draw money
from the wealthiest people in our society,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.920
the people who get their income
from owning assets rather than working.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.600
Ultimately, we need to find a way
to make the richest in our society

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.640
contribute to fixing this crisis
rather than simply profiting from it.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.000
Otherwise, financial security

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.680
is going to move
out of the reach of our kids.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.560
Thank you for watching.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.160
This is a message
which is really important to me.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.400
If you think it's important too, share
with your friends, share with your family.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.000
If you want to know more about me,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.680
you can see my Twitter
and my website in the description.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.160
Come back for more videos.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.680
Okay.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.520
Thanks again.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.640
Me trying to figure out what to say
at the end of the video.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.080
You know, it's a really good video.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.080
I'm glad we’ve gone through it,
because I know

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.240
obviously
at the time we made this video, we,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.360
it's the first video on the channel,
so obviously we didn't have no followers.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.680
We probably got like
a couple of thousand views,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.000
which is mainly our friends
and our friends of friends.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.040
You got 60,000 views on it now,
but obviously the channel

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.040
has grown massively,
especially in the last sort of six months,

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.440
and a lot of new people
won't have seen it. So,

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.000
you know, my
background is as an inequality economist

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.960
and I made a lot of money betting that
inequality will damage living standards

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.840
in the last five years and see the biggest

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.000
and fastest increase in inequality
in the history of the Western world

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.080
and I believe it’s driving
living standards down.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.360
It's a powerful video.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.880
You know, even now, five years later,
I think the predictions are really good.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.400
It's not easy to make good predictions
like that. So,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.400
yeah, you know, watch it, understand
it, share it,

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.680
but more importantly, understand that

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.240
inequality is hurting living standards
and it's not going to get any better.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.520
It's going to keep getting worse.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.680
Hopefully our videos

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.800
have gotten a little bit better
in terms of professionality.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.200
And I think maybe some people
question that.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.080
But more than anything,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.320
the channel is growing a lot
and we're really reaching of people.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.200
And that's thanks to all the people who've
been watching all of these four years.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.440
Unfortunately,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.680
inequality has continued to get worse
and worse and it's not getting any better.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.840
But thanks to the work of people like you
who been watching

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.000
throughout the years,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.200
we managed to educate more and more people
that it's a problem.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.200
And hopefully
if you keep teaching people,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.520
we can eventually reach the politicians
and we can force them

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.520
to reverse this growth in inequality.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.040
And if we do that,

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.520
then we can improve living standards
and we can stop seeing this

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.080
dreadful increase in poverty.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.040
I want it to change.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.000
I've been doing it for four years now.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I'm going to keep doing it.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.440
And thanks for your support.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.960
And let’s try and make things better. Tax
the rich.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.680
Reduce
inequality. Save the future. Thank you
