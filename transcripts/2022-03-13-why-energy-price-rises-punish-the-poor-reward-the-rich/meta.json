  "description": "Gary cancels his planned video so that he can talk about the recent Energy Price Rises which have dominated the news and left the poor wondering how they will survive. With the riches of Canary Wharf in the background he explains why these rises wont affect the rich nearly as much as you would think - but instead punishes the poor heavily - all while they are already being punished.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE, SHARE & START A CONVERSATION\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\nWEBSITE - https://www.wealtheconomics.org\nTWITTER - @garyseconomics\nFACEBOOK - @garyseconomics\nINSTAGRAM - @garyseconomics\n\n\nPerformed by Gary Stevenson\nGARYSECONOMICS\n\n\nProduced by Simran Mohan\nMOHAN MEDIA",
