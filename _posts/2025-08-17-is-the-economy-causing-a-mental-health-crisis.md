  Worsening mental health outcomes are often spoken about as if they are the fault of the individual, but is insecure mental health a natural outcome of an insecure economy?
  
  And does the feedback work both ways - insecure economies cause people to be scared, easily manipulated, and individualistic, which prevents ordinary people from uniting and fighting back as a class?
  
  Also a little on my own historical struggles with the economy and mental health, both in the past and now.
