  DON'T let politicians like Jeremy Hunt  tell you that the reason that THEY keep getting richer and richer and YOU keep getting poor and poorer is because you're just phenomenally unlucky... this is a system which as it is set up now is guaranteed to drive ordinary families into poverty and you need to fight back to stop it from happening
