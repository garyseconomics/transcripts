  "The government caused a £450 billion problem of inequality that money went to the rich and now they're trying to fix it with just 
  £15 billion pounds - 30 times less.
  
  The amount of money gone from the government to the rich is 30 times more than the amount of money they're giving you to fix it what does that mean well if you try putting a £15 billion pound sticking plaster on a £450 billion pound wound basically you're not going to fix the problem
  
   and none of the tory leadership candidates and i suspect probably no one in the tory party is serious about fixing that problem if you want to fix that problem you need to start taking serious amounts of money from the rich"
