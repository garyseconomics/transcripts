Coincidentally for any Kiwis or Aussies watching, I actually have a Oz/NZ tour coming up in Feb/Mar 2026.  They will kill me for forgetting to mention it in the video.  We currently have only one NZ date on the tour, Auckland on 4th March, but if it sells out quickly maybe I can convince them to add a second date:
