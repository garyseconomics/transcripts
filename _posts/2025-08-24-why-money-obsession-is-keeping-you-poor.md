  The economy is made up of real resources and the people who produce and own them. Money is different. Money is supposed to represent these real things and the relations between them, but it often fails to. Focusing too much on money – and interest rates and monetary policy – blinds us to how the economy actually works. Gary explains why this is so important if we want to change anything.

  Special message: I've been meeting MPs, lords, political influencers, TV and radio presenters and heads of think tanks every week to convince them to tax wealth not work. Momentum is seriously growing behind wealth taxes as we head towards the autumn Budget. We need your help to keep making videos every week, growing our team and building the movement to tax wealth not work. Make a one-off donation on Stripe: https://buy.stripe.com/dRm4gs9Nl1L6eqWbUydjO00 Or make a regular donation on Patreon: https://patreon.com/garyseconomics (on the Patreon you'll also get access to live Q&As with me and early access to content.) All donations go to our not-for-profit company. Thanks, Gary x
