  "ordinary families are not spending more money because they are not getting any more money because that money is flowing to the rich 
  these guys here wearing their bow ties and teaching in castles are not going to help us 
  a chancellor who is a billionaire is not going to help us 
  a prime minister who is a multi-millionaire is not going to help us 
  we have to help us, we have to make it happen 
  the way we do that is by educating ourselves and each other about economics 
  by teaching each other that the key thing we need to fix is wealth inequality 
  by teaching each other that if we don't fix wealth inequality 
  things are not going to get better but will get worse 
  but if we do fix it things can get so much better for all of us"
