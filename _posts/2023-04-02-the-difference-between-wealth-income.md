If you don't tax them they will use their enormous amounts of income to buy the rest of the wealth, wealth inequality will get higher and higher we will lose our middle class and we will fall into poverty. We need to tax hoarded accumulated wealth and if we did that it would actually enable us to potentially lower taxes on working people
