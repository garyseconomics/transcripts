description: "every single time you buy an asset - gold, stocks, anything - there's risk involved i think they're going to go up in general because cash is being devalued but that's no guarantee be prepared when you put the money in the value fluctuates day to day - it could go up it could go down i think you're more secure holding stocks in gold over the long term than cash but there's no guarantee when you buy things there's risk involved"
