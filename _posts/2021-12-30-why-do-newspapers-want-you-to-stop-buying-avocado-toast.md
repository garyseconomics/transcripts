  "these newspapers give a misleading idea that if you just work a little harder you just say that the more you get a property but the reality if you look at these articles is it's almost impossible in many places without a massive gift from your parents so if there are people out there who are watching feeling bad like i can't afford property it's not what these articles are saying the truth is realistically if you're from the wrong family nowadays it's almost impossible to get property"
