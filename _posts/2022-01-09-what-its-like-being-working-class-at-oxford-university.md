  Gary goes of in search of his favourite pubs as a student and talks about being working class at the elite Oxford University when he gets there.
  
  
  "I'm a nobody right, like I'm a short guy from a poor background in Ilford. I'm not handsome like a model, I don't have no connections you know,
  I mean I'm not excellent at football; the only thing I've got is I can make good predictions and because I understand the economy better than anyone else that is enough to get to the top in the city, but it gets you nowhere in academia
  
  I would have to spend years working the game and making connections and doing all of this stupid academic maths on whiteboards while at the same time the world's getting worse and worse & at the end of it there's no guarantee that I'm going to fix anything"
