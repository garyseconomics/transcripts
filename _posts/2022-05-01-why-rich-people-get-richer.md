description: "Rich people get richer because we give them all of our money. They use that money to make themselves richer and us poorer, if we don't do anything about it, things will get worse and worse and worse. So i would encourage you please to support me and this channel in pushing politicians to make a wealth tax happen to make things more equal going forward"
