  Former foreign exchange trader Gary Stevenson lifts the lid on mental health on the trading floor - being surrounded by wolves, becoming a wolf and deciding to leave.
  
  "I wish we didn't live in a world where it was so difficult just to get that basic amount of money you need to feel safe and i totally understand people are going to push and push and push till they get that but at the same time i want people to understand that the world that we live in is unfair and it's difficult and there's a lot of luck involved to be honest and if you are not making as much money as you want that doesn't mean you're a failure"
