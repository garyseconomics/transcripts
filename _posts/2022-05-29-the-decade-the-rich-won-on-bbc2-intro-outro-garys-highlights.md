"The government and the Bank of England took drastic action to save the UK economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Insiders from the world of finance tell us how decisions made to solve the crisis allowed them to ‘make out like bandits.’

With first-hand accounts from key players, this two-part series takes us inside the room when the big decisions were made"
