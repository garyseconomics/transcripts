"The government and the Bank of England took drastic action to save the UK economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Insiders from the world of finance tell us how decisions made to solve the crisis allowed them to ‘make out like bandits.’ 

From bailing out the banks to pursuing a faster, deeper austerity than any other country, Britain’s policymakers shatter the status quo in a desperate bid to save the economy. With first-hand accounts from key players, this two-part series takes us inside the room when the big decisions were made"
