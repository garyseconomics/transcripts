description: "Do you want a big welfare state? okay well you can have one if you fix wealth inequality if you don't then you can't have one... Okay well do you want low taxes? well you can have them if you fix wealth inequality, well if you don't then you can't have them... If you don't fix wealth inequality then we have to have high taxes on the middle class & bad education, bad healthcare, bad welfare state... you get the worst of all possible worlds"
