You don't need to be an economist, you say okay well if the rich get a ton of money they're going to push the prices up, which will be fine for them because they've got a ton of money. That will hurt the rest of us right and the rich will start to consume a larger share of the natural resources and natural resources become more expensive for the rest of us, that's not complicated okay. That happened it's obvious it's obvious and that's £450 billion pounds and now Rishi Sunak like is on tv saying oh don't worry we stand by ready to help with £5 billion pounds. You give £450 billion pounds to the rich and then you say we're gonna help with £5 billion pounds. It's not it's not gonna it's not going to help right and then Labour say we're going to do a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and we're going to raise £2 billion pounds. These guys are so far out of touch you know they're playing a different game you know if you transfer £450 billion pounds to the rich and then you you take £5 billion pounds back, you're going to destroy the economy right! but but who's talking about it? listen..."
