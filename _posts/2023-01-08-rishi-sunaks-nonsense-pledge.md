"we know inflation will come down because every month you have inflation and then the number they show on the news is the Annual Inflation so it's the last 12 months right and the big inflation months last year were I think like March, April, May - big big inflation months right - so we know that in six months time those massive months will drop out of the data so we know with almost certainty that inflation is going to come down really quickly"
