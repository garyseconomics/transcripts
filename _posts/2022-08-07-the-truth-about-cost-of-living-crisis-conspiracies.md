Covid-19? Russian Invasion? Supply Chain Issues? 
or Â£450 billion of printed money that ended up in the bank accounts of the Super Rich?

"it's not about conspiracy it's simply about rich people trying to get richer by buying the best resources, buying the best knowledge and that means ordinary people are not going to get good resources for free and i think that's why it's so important i do this 

as somebody who was one of the best paid economists i'd give the people good information because people in the city the best people in the city they know this is happening but they're bought into it they're well paid to do it and they feel like they can't stop it

 whether i can stop it i don't know but i feel like i deserve to at least try and people deserve to to be told what's happening so um my concern with these conspiracy theories is they get people to be too negative and they get people to be angry but the only way we win this is if we get people to be positive and for people to come together"
