  We have not yet been able to film a full response to Friday's "budget".  
  We will try to get that out for next week, in the meantime here is an interview I did yesterday where it is discussed with Paul Daly & Sarah Wooley at the TWT Festival 22 in Liverpool.
  
  *Apologies for sound problems which get much better after the first few minutes*
