00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.560
Ok so i wanna do a video that covers one&nbsp;of the
most common questions we get on the&nbsp;channel&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:17.120
which is people saying "i'm in, i'm&nbsp;down but
what can we do?" and the way i want&nbsp;to&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.400
answer that is to basically talk about how&nbsp;i have
approached the question of "what should i&nbsp;do?"

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.640
so i became convinced that inequality was&nbsp;
basically the core economic problem when i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.880
was a trader back in sort of 2010, 2011
2012, 2013 and i finally quit that job in 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.040
basically thinking okay i have&nbsp;
to do something but what do i do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
so the very first thing i did was i basically&nbsp;
wrote down i made a website which wrote down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.680
really clearly how does inequality affect the&nbsp;
economy if anybody wants to read that website it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.400
still up it's wealtheconomics.org we've bought
the name garyseconomics.org i should really move it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.800
to that but it's currently wealtheconomics.org&nbsp;
so i explained the theory and it took me like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.120
a couple of months to write this website really&nbsp;
clearly and then i finished it and realised like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.520
no one is ever going to see this&nbsp;
website because nobody knows who i am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.480
so i thought okay basically at this point i've&nbsp;got 2
options which is try to get famous so people read 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.760
my website or go back to uni and&nbsp;convince
academics so they can spread the message&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.240
and this might be a surprise to some people but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.000
it was never originally my intention to become&nbsp;
famous so i decided to go back to university first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.720
that's when i realised the guys at university are&nbsp;
just like out of the game they are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
fix this so i realised okay you're going to try&nbsp;
to build this message up yourself and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.480
why for the last nearly two years i've been trying&nbsp;
to basically build a brand to spread this message

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.680
and my belief is if people understood how serious&nbsp;
this situation was, how bad the economy will become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.520
if we don't fix inequality then it would be number&nbsp;
one priority for people when they went to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.120
voting booth and people would demand from their&nbsp;
politicians you have to fix this, this is like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.840
urgent disaster the reality of the situation&nbsp;
is if we don't fix wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.280
life is going to get significantly worse for&nbsp;people
in this country generation after generation&nbsp;after&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.960
generation, you know the next generation will...&nbsp;
we're already seeing it now you know it's gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.560
be a struggle just for a basic life for a lot of&nbsp;people
and that will become more and more common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
and it will become increasingly impossible to&nbsp;
get rich you know it will be very difficult even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.000
to just get a basic level of comfort that's the&nbsp;
reality if we don't fix wealth inequality right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.680
if people knew that they would stop it but i&nbsp;
think the number one problem at the moment is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.880
people don't people don't realize that people are&nbsp;
not being told the truth about the economy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.600
are not being told look the economy is going to&nbsp;
get worse year after year that's the truth right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.920
if people knew that they would stop it so what&nbsp;
i'm trying to do is make as many people as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.600
possible aware and my hope initially and it&nbsp;
still is my hope is that people will see it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.360
they'll jump on board and they'll amplify the&nbsp;
message so people watch these videos they'll

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
share it with their friends you know i mean they'll&nbsp;
share it with their family and increasingly people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.600
start to realise look this is what's happening&nbsp;
and i always try and back it up with predictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.480
like at the beginning of Covid i said&nbsp;look this
will happen with Covid - the rich will&nbsp;get richer&nbsp;

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.880
house prices will go up, stock price will go  
up, inequality will go up, inflation will go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.040
and hopefully people will see those things and&nbsp;
they'll realise that this guy Gary - he's right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.240
and they'll see also things continuing to get&nbsp;
worse and worse and worse and they'll say we&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.000
need to support this guy basically i mean what&nbsp;will
happen for sure is if we don't fix wealth&nbsp;inequality&nbsp;

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.400
things will get worse that is what will&nbsp;happen
and at the moment we're not heading towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.000
fixing wealth inequality so things are going to&nbsp;
get worse and that means people are going to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.840
angrier people are going to get more frustrated&nbsp;
with the status quo and people are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.120
looking for alternatives right and my idea now&nbsp;
is that this channel and these ideas become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.440
an alternative and the way they will become an&nbsp;
alternative is by people supporting them by people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.280
spreading the message so you know recently i've&nbsp;
been a bit more aggressive with saying look follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.160
the channel get your friends to follow the channel&nbsp;
spread the channel because the bigger my voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.040
gets the more influential these ideas become you&nbsp;
know i got invited to go to parliament this week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.920
and they're just doing that because they want&nbsp;
to give a little like yeah we invited him at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.840
moment i'm not big enough to actually force them&nbsp;
to make a change but if we get bigger and bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.480
and bigger and more people are listening to these&nbsp;
ideas we can get a point where they have to listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.320
and we can get a point where we can make this&nbsp;
international you know and i know that's ambitious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.840
but the problem is massive so we have&nbsp;
to be ambitious you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.240
so when people say what can i do

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.320
we have to build a movement we have to build a&nbsp;
movement and you know it might sound selfish me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.240
saying you need to support this channel you need&nbsp;
to support my socials you need to share my videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
but who else is doing this you know if there&nbsp;are
other people out there doing this get in&nbsp;touch&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.000
with me and there are some people you know i&nbsp;
support Patriotic Millionaires i support Tax Justice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640
UK but the truth is nobody is spreading this&nbsp;
message on a big enough scale so i'm trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.160
do it so the number one you know i always bring it&nbsp;
down to these three things first of all understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.680
the number one idea of this channel is to help&nbsp;
ordinary people understand what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.480
i think nobody's out there making economics&nbsp;
accessible and easy to understand and explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.400
what's happening so these videos are here so&nbsp;
ordinary ordinary people can understand quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.000
simply wealth inequality is [ __ ] you and it's&nbsp;
[ __ ] the economy it's as simple as that and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
if and that it's not going to get better unless&nbsp;
we fix it listen wealth inequality is a cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.560
in this economy and if somebody's got cancer you&nbsp;
could do whatever you like around about it if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.800
don't fix the cancer that person will die and that&nbsp;
is what is going to happen in this economy if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.280
do not fix wealth inequality everything else will&nbsp;
gradually become unaffordable and you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.440
it happening the nhs will become unaffordable&nbsp;
good quality education will become unaffordable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.840
good quality housing unaffordable we will lose&nbsp;
all of the things that our great grandparents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.920
worked and fought so hard for to make this country&nbsp;
a country in which ordinary people can have a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.960
quality of life we will lose those things if we&nbsp;
don't fix wealth inequality so how do we fix it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.760
look it's not going to be short and sharp it's not&nbsp;
going to be easy but it's possible listen i quit a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.680
million-pound-a-year job to do this and i wouldn't&nbsp;
have done that if i thought it was impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.000
i could be on a beach in the Philippines but&nbsp;
i'm here in London in the cold wearing a&nbsp;coat&nbsp;

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.320
because i think we can fix this i think we&nbsp;
can fix this but it's not going to be easy look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.040
very rich people don't want this don't want things&nbsp;
to change because they're doing very well out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.720
this and they're on the newspapers you know what i&nbsp;
mean and they're in the radio stations and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.560
going to go out and say oh no you shouldn't tax&nbsp;
the rich if you do it be an economic disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.800
understand that's [ __ ] secondly they're going&nbsp;
to say oh but you can't tax them because they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.880
leave understand that's [ __ ] you know and we&nbsp;
we've explained both of those things extensively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.600
on this channel and we will explain them more&nbsp;
understand that we have to fix it if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.640
to fix the economy and we can fix it if we agree&nbsp;
that this is the only thing we vote for it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.480
only thing that we demand it's number one priority&nbsp;
um so that's what we have to do educate yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.960
support this channel if you have ways that&nbsp;
you can support like get in touch what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.280

people to do subtitles so we can make it&nbsp;
international yeah people who have basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.160
to help us grow the channel because we're getting&nbsp;
to the stage now there's a lot of good videos&nbsp;here 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.520
and it needs to be bigger we're only going to&nbsp;change
things if we make things bigger you know so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.840
*we tried to approach like Russell Brand...* yeah listen&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.960
or if you know anyone with a big voice who can&nbsp;
help us amplify them put them in touch with us man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.720
because look i'm out here i was one of the&nbsp;
best paid economists in the world i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.200
what's happening i called it from the start i know&nbsp;
what's happening i know how to fix it but i need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.160
to get on the stage so i need people to help me&nbsp;
to do that basically um in the meantime we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.000
going to be out here on my balcony making videos&nbsp;
every week and out in the parks watch the videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.840
share the videos, subscribe, press that little&nbsp;
bell thing whatever it does apparently it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.600
good for the channel but help us grow man and&nbsp;
spread the message and you know you can talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600
your politicians but the main thing we need is&nbsp;
basically people to help us build the voice but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.280
every single person watching can help by&nbsp;
subscribing and sharing with their friends man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.280
and understanding what's happening and being&nbsp;
passionate and it's it's not even just about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.520
me when you're talking to your friends and your&nbsp;
family about the economy say look i think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.800
problem is inequality of wealth and i'm&nbsp;
not just saying that there's this guy who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.520
explains it very clearly - show them my website,&nbsp;
show them my videos like look it's ideas and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.160
stories that change the world, things are going&nbsp;
to get really really really seriously bad here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.480
seriously and that is [ __ ] up but it's also an&nbsp;
opportunity to change things listen the last thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.040
that really really significantly improved quality&nbsp;
of life in this country and all over the west was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.960
the second world war because things were so [ __&nbsp;
] up that people said no we're not going to accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.000
it we demand change and they got change they&nbsp;
got affordable housing good quality healthcare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.360
good quality education for all the people in this&nbsp;
country even the poorest people in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.440
and it was the second world war that achieved&nbsp;
that because when times are really really bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.920
that's an opportunity to bring people together i&nbsp;
mean have an opportunity like that now and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.800
what i'm trying to do here so i would encourage&nbsp;
anybody support the channel support anyone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.400
you know who's campaigning for inequality bring&nbsp;
people in and help grow this voice and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.600
hopefully is how we achieve change and i'm&nbsp;
not saying it's going to work i'm not saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840
we're definitely going to win but if we&nbsp;
lose it's a big problem so we have to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.800
so yeah please support us keep&nbsp;
watching keep sharing thank you
