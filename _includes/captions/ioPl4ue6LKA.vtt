00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.080
i feel like we have more chance of making&nbsp;
a difference talking to the ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.200
who are actually being hurt and being affected&nbsp;
because they're going to see it and they're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.480
to be like this is affecting me and my family we&nbsp;
need to do something about it whereas i can talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.440
about it here with all these guys doing all&nbsp;
their maths &amp; algebra, they don't care really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.120
they're comfortable and their families comfortable&nbsp;
and their community is comfortable you know

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.160
this is Lamb &amp; Flag, one of Oxford's many fine pubs&nbsp;
its my favourite pub, cash only for no obvious reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.840
this one's closed too

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.360
let's check one more time 
for 'stand by me' man

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.640
if he's not there like... I just&nbsp;
hope that he's there basically

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.680
he's not here man,
'stand by me' man is not here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
okay *are you alright?* 
no it's&nbsp;fine hopefully he's just... yeah

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.320
it's some really old church isn't it&nbsp;
yeah, no, yeah it's the Saxon tower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.840
of Saint Michael at the north gate&nbsp;
the oldest church tower in Oxford

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.720
so this I think is Baylor college&nbsp;
which is um Boris Johnson's college

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.840
these are quite good... heads

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.120
that's where we did our matriculation&nbsp;
do you know what matriculation is?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.840
it's like where you're like&nbsp;formally 
enrolled into the university

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.240
actually makes me you know what&nbsp;
like walking down these alleyways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.400
makes me quiet suddenly really nostalgic
what&nbsp;it was i thought there was maybe

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.440
I thought speakeasy, yeah I've never
that's the alternative&nbsp;name for 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.840
speak easy - stealth pub

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680
this is it you can see how I [ ____ ] missed it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.560
yeah turf is not far from econ department so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.400
yeah every now and again when i just got too too&nbsp;
pissed off at the nonsense that we were doing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.840
econ lectures I would just just leave and come&nbsp;
here and have a pint sometimes you've got to do it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.000
so when I came here, 2017,  so I was&nbsp;30 years 
old, about to turn 31, so I'd already&nbsp;had the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
successful career in the city so like, it&nbsp;was a 
funny one for me because I did economics&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360
and then i had a very successful career and I kind&nbsp;
of learned in my career that what I studied at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.120
university was not particularly useful so i&nbsp;
kind of already thought like i'm coming here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400
you know I was one of the best paid economists&nbsp;
in the world you know what I mean so like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.960
I'm thinking I'm coming here to discuss but 
the professors... there were professors who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.360
did exactly, looked at exactly the kind of stuff&nbsp;
that I did right: interest rates, central banks,&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.880
monetary policy... and I was like okay well you&nbsp;
know I'm one of the best paid people in the world 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.720
in this area, one of the most successful predictors&nbsp;
in the world in this area, let's talk about it...&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.000
and they were not interested um 
*I know that's what&nbsp;you did* 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:23.440
*but I just mean* from a class perspective? by 30
31 I'd already been you know 6 years in the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.920
3 years at LSE and these are already places&nbsp;
where there is basically almost no people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.840
from working-class backgrounds,&nbsp;actually 
LSE wasn't as bad as&nbsp;the City &amp; Oxford

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.920
um so I've kind of become&nbsp;used to 
this like you know you exist in the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.560
you're used to the fact that there's no people&nbsp;
from working class background um is it i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400
it's frustrating because when you're talking&nbsp;
about economics you're talking about issues &nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.840
that affect people from working class 
backgrounds and&nbsp;people from privileged 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.800
backgrounds differently, um it was frustrating 
because some&nbsp;of my like people on my course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.400
were just disconnected from what was 
happening&nbsp;and it's so easy for them to just 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.240
argue&nbsp;maths&nbsp;and like little technical points&nbsp;
of philosophy but they don't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.000
you know like for me it affects my sister 
you know&nbsp;I mean? you know what I'm saying? 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.360
you know? and like my best friends from 
childhood, but for&nbsp;them it's like just like a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.000
it's like a nice&nbsp;like philosophical debate to have 
in the pub or&nbsp;to have in the common room

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.400
you know i mean? and it is&nbsp;frustrating 
when like, you don't feel that&nbsp;they feed it on 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.440
an emotional level it's just like uh...&nbsp;&nbsp;
something to talk about... they don't

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.200
i think it's...&nbsp;you know... I think you know 
lack of class diversity&nbsp;in a lot of areas

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.240
is important but in economics it&nbsp;just has 
this extra pain that you know we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.200
economists should be discussing the&nbsp;
economic problems of people's lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.080
*but it seems like the more advanced you've&nbsp;
got in economics the more exclusive it gets*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.440
yeah definitely it does yeah for sure 
*even with&nbsp;you probably acclimatizing*

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.240
yeah like Post-grad was worse than Under-grad&nbsp;
and I'm sure if you do PhD it'd be worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.000
and then the professors are the worst of all&nbsp;you know 
what I mean um *would you consider doing a&nbsp;PhD?*&nbsp;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.080
you know never say never but like when you&nbsp;
consider it would take so long and I feel like

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.320
when I worked in the city if you are very good at&nbsp;
what you do you can progress very quickly but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.680
feel like in academic economics it's a lot who you&nbsp;
know and just like do you play the game right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.320
you know listen listen i'm a nobody right like i'm

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.480
a short guy from a poor background in Ilford&nbsp;
I'm not like handsome like a model I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.840
have no connections you know what I mean 
I'm not&nbsp;excellent football the only thing I've got is

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.200
I can make good predictions and like because 
I understand the economy better than anyone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.840
that is enough to get to the top in the city&nbsp;but 
it gets you nowhere in academia, nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.560
so like i would have to spend years working the&nbsp;
game and making connections and doing all of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.800
stupid academic maths on whiteboards at the same&nbsp;
time the world's getting worse and worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.640
and at the end of it there's no guarantee that I'm&nbsp;
going to fix anything and there are good people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.840
in economics right there's most famously 
Thomas&nbsp;Piketty but there's also Gabriel Zucman 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.840
Mian &amp; Sufi, Ludwig Straub these guys right like&nbsp;
who are doing this stuff in the academic space but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.360
i don't think it's really possible at the moment&nbsp;
even if you're saying exactly the right things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.520
to actually push through in economics because&nbsp;
nobody nobody knows nobody cares whether you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.000
right or not nobody even notices whether you're&nbsp;
right or not you know what i mean so i feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.840
like we have more chance of making a difference&nbsp;
talking to the ordinary people who are actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.880
being hurt and being affected because they're&nbsp;
going to see it and they're going to be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.680
this is affecting me and my family we need&nbsp;
to do something about it whereas i can talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.720
about it here with all these guys doing all&nbsp;
their maths and algebra they don't care really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.880
they're comfortable and their families comfortable&nbsp;
and their community is comfortable you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.160
so um never say never and I did enjoy like&nbsp;
you know I'm good at maths and algebra and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.000
I enjoy doing it and I enjoy the beauty&nbsp;
of the model but the problem is the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.240
are too often I don't wanna act like everyone 
in&nbsp;economics is a [ __ ] because they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.520
there's a lot of good people but there&nbsp;
are a lot of people that are just just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.880
chatting [ __ ] all the time basically and they&nbsp;
don't care they don't want to change anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.040
they're just careerists they just want to write 
a load of papers and make a load of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.520
they don't care about being right they don't&nbsp;
care about what's happening it's frustrating

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.400
*it's sounds frustrating*

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.520
it's frustrating being there man&nbsp;
it was frustrating being there but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.480
oh it's all right you know i went&nbsp;
gym every day what can you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.000
did a lot of algebra i made some good&nbsp;mates 
there are some good people here in the subject

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
*you know the economists you mentioned, 
Piketty, what background are they from?*

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.000
i don't know actually to be&nbsp;honest 
i don't know to be honest, um

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.920
Atif Mian is the one that I talk to 
I&nbsp;think is it Atif Mian? yeah

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.840
*have they encountered similar difficulties?* 
so he's&nbsp;from Pakistan so obviously there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.840
of poverty in Pakistan I don't know what&nbsp;his 
background is like, if he got into the&nbsp;industry

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.800
he's probably not like from poverty&nbsp;or anything 
um Ludwig Straub is German, Piketty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.640
I don't know what these guys personal back..
I don't think they're from poor backgrounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.400
I don't know who's from a poor background
i dunno, there's another guy Ha-Joon Chang

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.880
that I like, he looks at kind of different stuff and&nbsp;
he's got he's well known he's got a lot of books&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.400
if anybody's like looking for more reading to&nbsp;
do like especially if you're interested in like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.200
poorer countries you know there's a lot of&nbsp;
people who have family from poor countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.800
who might be watching and interested in the&nbsp;
situations in these countries he talks about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.920
um i don't know but like i mean when you meet&nbsp;
someone you don't automatically know their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.320
background but you kind of you can get a vibe&nbsp;
from the accent and stuff what was amazing is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.840
this is Oxford, its the top university in England&nbsp;
there were no English accent you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.960
there was one guy on the course from Harrogate&nbsp;
which is in Yorkshire, had a Yorkshire accent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.000
I don't think he was like strapped for cash&nbsp;
nice guy um there were like there was one &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.400
British-Indian guy from Manchester, no from 
Birmingham, tried to pretend he's from Manchester 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:27.840
maybe from somewhere between, Stoke, yeah there
was no accents man and that's because everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.240
is just from that same sort of rich background&nbsp;
from all different countries yeah it's a shame

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.920
I'm getting really emotional
I just haven't

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.880
i don't know there's something about&nbsp;
these alleyways that i like and

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.880
because i used to go to 
this pub and have a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.200
of drinks and then you sort of&nbsp;
stagger through these alleyways

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.520
it's a beautiful night as well like&nbsp;
after a rainy day suddenly we've got this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.840
perfectly clear starry sky

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.120
poorer families will be forced&nbsp;to lose almost 
all of their assets... including their home

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.200
we have a tax system which is&nbsp;very efficient 
at taxing ordinary working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:27.600
but very inefficient at taxing the super rich
