00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.960
Cool.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.760
Just do a quick sound check. One two. One two. One two.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.880
That's good.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.960
Whenever you’re ready.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.200
We’re good, yeah?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Yeah, good.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040
Right.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.400
All right.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.320
We're going to do a video about the election.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.400
To be honest,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.160
I didn't really want to do a video about the election

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.520
because the election is very often so much bullsh*t.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.040
We get everybody

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.360
very, very excited, and then,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.280
nothing changes and people get quite depressed.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.320
As you know, this channel is an economics channel,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.880
and we have a very clear message

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.320
and a very clear idea on this channel, which is that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.760
inequality, specifically

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.440
inequality of wealth is growing and growing,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.480
that is causing falls

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.520
in living standards for ordinary families,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.240
which you can see.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.920
And it's going to get worse and worse.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.880
And we need to change that.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.520
people often ask me, why don't you get into politics?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.200
And, when people say that to me,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.280
I always say the same thing, which is I'm in politics.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.400
I'm in politics.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.880
I often ask them, you know, Rupert Murdoch,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.840
you know, is he in politics?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960
So Rupert Murdoch, for people

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.240
who don't know

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.640
he owns, he's a very, very, very wealthy Australian

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.120
who owns a lot of newspapers,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.520
a lot of TV channels

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.560
here in the UK, also in Australia,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.360
I think in the US as well, all across the world.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.840
And,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.280
he basically tries to convince people

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.200
to hate foreigners and not tax rich people.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.360
And it's something he's been very successful at.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.480
And, he controls a lot of politicians and politicians

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.560
do what he says

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.520
because he controls

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.960
what people think and who people vote for.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.960
So

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.800
the first thing to say is

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.720
we're going to get a new prime minister

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.800
early next month.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.880
Rishi Sunak,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.360
the current prime minister, has called an election.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.640
He will lose that election.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.880
And Keir Starmer,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.600
the head of the Labour Party,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000
will become prime minister on July 4th.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640
A lot of people will be very excited about that.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.840
That's understandable.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.480
The Conservatives have been in power for 14 years now.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.920
I was a very young man when they took power.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.160
They've overseen, enormous increase in inequality.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.240
They've overseen an enormous increase in poverty.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.720
they've overseen an enormous fall in living standards.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.280
In many cases, most of the senior

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.840
politicians, Conservative

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.120
politicians are very, very wealthy people from very,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.800
very wealthy backgrounds.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.840
In particular, Rishi Sunak

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.520
is an extremely wealthy man

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.040
from an extremely wealthy family.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.440
I've been criticising him

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.120
ever since he became chancellor

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.520
because he has consistently brought in policies

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.120
which have enriched the richest,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.040
that have increased inequality

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160
and, in my opinion, have been the source

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.200
of falling living standards in this country.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.360
So you might think

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.800
I would

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.280
be absolutely delighted

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.520
at the fact that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.840
the Conservatives are going to be voted out.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.360
there's a good chance they will not only be voted out,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.920
but they will

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.560
lose very badly, that they will lose

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680
a lot of seats, that a lot of famous

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.040
MPs will lose their seats.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160
And a lot of people

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.520
on the left are understandably very excited about that.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.120
And, you know,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.080
I would like to be excited about it as well.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.240
Don't get me wrong,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.880
I will probably enjoy

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.200
watching Rishi Sunak lose, and it would be nice

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.240
if some big Conservative MPs who have

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.720
consistently opposed tax on the rich lose their seats.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.960
But it's very hard for me to be excited

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.080
because I don't think we will see

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.160
any improvements in living standards

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.320
and

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.360
I think that there's

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.160
a tendency,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.360
an understandable tendency

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.560
to see politics as a bit like football.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.600
You know, I support this political team.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.360
You support that political team.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.640
I want your political team to lose,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.440
I want my political team to win.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.960
But my background is not politics.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.120
My background is economics,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.760
and my background is a trader.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.960
And what I am worried about

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.040
is the continual collapse in living standards.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.640
I don't think we will change that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.680
unless you do something about inequality.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.080
we need to stop it from rising.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.840
It is rising very quickly.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.840
If we don't take action on that

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.960
living standards will continue to fall.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.480
And my honest opinion,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.280
unfortunately, is that the new government,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.760
that the new Labour government

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800
will not take action on that,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.760
they will not stop inequality from rising.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.840
They will not stop living standards from falling.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.520
So it's really difficult for me to be excited,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.280
about the election.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.960
So the first message I want to put across is

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.160
don't get too excited.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.960
There's going to be a lot...

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.520
I say that,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.200
I think a lot of people won't be excited anyway,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.880
because I think people won't have high expectations.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.360
There'll be a lot of political coverage on the news.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.440
the Conservatives will lose.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.960
They'll probably lose by quite a lot.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.560
We'll get a Labour government.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.200
Don't raise your hopes too much,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.120
because I worry when we see things like this,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.360
everybody gets very excited.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.760
Everybody hopes are more. Everybody expects change.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.440
And then when change doesn't come, people

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.280
become disappointed, people become despondent,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.440
people become depressed,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.040
and people start to completely lose

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.480
faith in the status quo in what's happening.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.480
This election, in my opinion, is not

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.240
the big fight.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.760
So let’s talk about why.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.440
But before I do that, I want to say as well,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.520
please avoid the excessive

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.880
football-ification of politics.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.880
I view politics through the lens of the economy.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.960
My view on the economy at the moment is that

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.600
it is collapsing.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.640
From the perspective of living

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.680
standards of ordinary people, that's not going to stop.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.640
The only way to stop that, in

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.720
my opinion, is for ordinary people to unite and agree

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.680
that we need to take action, stopping

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.240
the increasing exploding wealth of the very rich

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.120
and the transfer of wealth

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.640
from ordinary people to the very rich.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.840
When we divide

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.360
ordinary working people into red and blue and yellow,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.720
it often makes it harder to achieve that unity.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.280
So don't allow this election

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.520
to create more division between ordinary people.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.480
That being said,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.520
we need to do some analysis of the election itself.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.240
So let's get started.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.640
So the first thing is the calling

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200
of the election itself. And this is

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.480
quite, quite funny in a way.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.640
We put a video out a few weeks ago

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.000
predicting that inflation would fall in this country

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.600
for really obvious reasons.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.880
You know, it's a good video.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880
Go back and watch it.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.360
I think it's called

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.440
predicting inflation

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.160
or why inflation will fall this week.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.840
We'll put a link in the description.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.880
And in that video we said that

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.920
almost certainly the official inflation

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.120
statistic for the country

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.760
would fall significantly this month.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.000
It was extremely predictable.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.960
It was for historical reasons.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.320
But we knew that the government

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.360
tried to take credit for it.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.960
And, I honestly think that is the reason

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.000
they've called this election.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.320
if you go back and look at that video,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.880
we explain that inflation was bountiful this month.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.280
It will probably fall again slightly next month,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.400
and then it will start to rise after that.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.480
So if we have an election on

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.080
July the 4th, which we will,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.400
we will have just seen a couple

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.760
of inflation statistics prints which look really good

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.960
for the government.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.440
And we won't yet

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.040
have had the inflation starting to rise again.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.640
The Conservatives and Rishi

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.400
Sunak are currently very unpopular,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.840
but here is this one statistic,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.960
which they have tried to claim aggressive credit for.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.920
Inflation is coming down.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.120
It will probably come down again

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.040
in the print this month.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.120
They want to claim credit for that.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.600
And I think they've decided that

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.600
this is kind of the only good news story

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.680
that they've got.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.840
So let's run with it.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.800
Let's call it an election

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.240
while inflation is low and let’s hope people will

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.840
vote for us.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.960
But not a lot of people are going to vote for them,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.480
which is largely

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.320
because living standards

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.040
have really significantly collapsed

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.560
under their government.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.840
So, you know, I follow the betting odds quite closely.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.560
It's almost certain

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.840
the Conservatives will lose and Labour win,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.120
Labour will win an overall majority.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.720
it could be a pretty significant overall majority. And,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.000
different people have different opinions

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.640
on why that is.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.840
But I think that is almost exclusively

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.480
because living standards have fallen so much,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.280
and it's been 14 years of Conservative government.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.000
People can see that life is getting harder.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.880
People want change.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.680
I don't think there's a lot of particular enthusiasm

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.600
for the Labour Party.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.800
But here in the United Kingdom,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.640
we have a first past the post political system,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.480
which I can discuss a little bit more,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.800
perhaps in another video.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.920
It basically means that similarly to the US,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.200
we have a two party system

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.000
where it's almost impossible for any party

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.480
other than the two major parties to take power.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.280
So if you don't like the Conservatives,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.880
if you're not happy with the falling living standards,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.000
you basically have no choice other than Labour.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.080
The Conservatives and Rishi

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.400
Sunak are extremely unpopular,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.440
so we're going to get a

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.760
probably a significantly large Labour majority

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.520
in this government.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.440
What does that mean?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.760
You know,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.800
I've got here on my list

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.560
to go through the policies of the parties, but,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.040
you know,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.680
you're going to get the policies of the parties

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.960
and the manifestos of the parties

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.600
rammed down your neck on BBC news and Sky news

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.120
as if they're important, as if they matter.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.800
To be honest, they don't really matter.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.960
They're going to make a lot of promises.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.400
They're going to promise to cut your taxes.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.440
They're going to promise to do loads of amazing things,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.280
which they basically can't pay for

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.600
because I don't think you can fund these things

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.280
if you're not willing to raise taxes on the rich.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.360
So it's a lot of pie in the sky policy.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.360
Really, you've got two

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.320
parties that are promising to continue

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.600
pretty much the economic status quo.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.000
You probably get a little bit more austerity

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.720
under the Conservatives,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.320
which would probably be worse,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.520
but I think

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.320
Labour have not really offered us anything significant.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.120
You know, behind the scenes,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.400
I talk to Labour politicians

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.720
and I try to lobby Labour politicians

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.880
to do more on inequality,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.560
but basically we have not done enough

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.920
and we're not going to get enough,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.200
when I ask Labour politicians

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.760
why you're not taking action on inequality,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.960
why are you not taxing very rich people?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.120
Some of them say we would like to do it,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.840
but we don't think it's a vote winner.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.160
For me, that's quite depressing

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.880
because this is what I tried to do on this channel.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880
The whole point of this channel

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.120
is for me to convince you

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.800
that the only way to stop the fall in living

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.840
standards is to stop the increase in inequality.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.880
The only way to stop the increasing

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.160
inequality is to significantly

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.560
increase taxes on the rich,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.480
so that we can cut tax on ordinary people.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.680
And unfortunately,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.840
both the major political parties at this point in time

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.200
don't think that's a vote winner.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.320
So that's a failure for me and that's a failure for us.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.800
But the truth of the matter is,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.680
I never thought that we would win

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.880
anything in this election.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.360
I was expecting the election to be the end of the year.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.960
October, November.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.280
I've been trying to really aggressively

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.000
grow this channel,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.400
but it was never really to target this year's election

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.080
because I never thought

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.520
we would get much from this year's election.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.160
But there is

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.400
one small shrapnel of hope,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.120
something that we can be proud of,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.800
that I can be proud of, that you can be proud of,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.760
which is that the Green Party has adopted our call.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.120
The Green Party has adopted basically, exactly

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.800
what I've been campaigning for,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.320
which is a 1% tax on wealth

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.440
and wealth of about £10 million.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.800
That's something that I'm proud of.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.360
It's something that you can be proud of.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.120
Anyone who watches this channel,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.200
he supports this channel who

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.320
helps to grow this channel.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.200
It is, of course, not just because of me.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.880
You know, there's a lot of groups that I work with

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.440
that have been campaigning for this as well.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.080
There's the Patriotic Millionaires who have done

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.840
amazing work.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.040
Rebecca Gowland who runs that organisation, has done

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.560
an amazing work, and all of the millionaires

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.600
who are part of that group have done

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.120
amazing work campaigning for it.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.040
Tax Justice UK

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.800
have been campaigning for the same thing.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.160
Economists like Arun Advani

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.880
at Warwick have been campaigning for the same thing.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.720
And we've got it

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.320
into the Green manifesto, into the Green policy,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.840
which is something we should be proud of.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.800
And, you know, I'm really grateful

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.960
for everyone who's pushed for it,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.840
and I'm grateful for the Greens

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.920
putting it in their manifesto.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.560
The reality is the Greens are,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.720
of course, not going to get into power

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.120
in this election.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.760
The nature of our political system,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.880
basically, it's a two party job.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.000
And, it's very, very difficult to shift that.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.200
But if the Greens do well,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.280
if the Greens get more votes,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.240
in the best case scenario,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.960
they could win a couple more seats.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.560
It is a message that people are willing

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.400
to accept these kinds of policies. So,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.040
I'll be voting for the Greens, and,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.200
I'm not going to tell you guys who to vote for, but,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.040
these guys have adopted

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320
what we've been campaigning for.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.600
The reality is they're not going to win.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.520
But if they get a big vote, if they get a big...

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.720
if they get a couple more seats,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.040
which in the best case they could, it is a good sign.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.560
It is a good sign. So that's who I'll be voting for.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.800
So what could happen? You know, the truth is,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.880
I don't think this is going to be...

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.240
even though we might see like

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.680
a big political landslide,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.080
a big collapse in the Conservatives

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.080
and a massive majority for Labour,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.800
I don't think it really changes our game much,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.760
because Labour are not really going

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.880
to give us the policies that we want.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.240
The truth is, we might get a few more opportunities.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.960
I put a video out

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.400
when Rishi Sunak became Conservative leader.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.880
It's easy to forget this now,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.600
but when Rishi Sunak became Conservative leader,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.920
he had a really good brand.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.160
He was considered to be really smart, really competent,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.200
really good with money,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.800
and a lot of people were really happy to see him

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.760
be prime minister.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.720
And, I put a video out saying

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.280
Rishi Sunak will be phenomenally unpopular

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.880
in a year's time,

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.800
just basically, specifically

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800
for the exact same reasons that I'm telling you

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.440
now that Keir Starmer will be very unpopular

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.080
in a year, year

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.640
and a half time

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.640
because Rishi Sunak did not take action on inequality,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.200
which meant living standards continue to fall.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.400
Keir Starmer looks like he's

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.240
not going to take action on inequality,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.720
which means living standards will continue to fall.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.800
So,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.720
Rishi Sunak's popularity collapsed,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.000
but that really never gave us any opportunities

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.960
because I've never once been contacted

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.840
by a Conservative MP on the work that I do.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.840
If a Labour win

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.280
a year, two years, three years

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.400
into a Labour government,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.320
if living standards have not recovered,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.920
which they won't,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.120
Keir Starmer will be very unpopular.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.640
There might be demand for change and for new policies.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.840
If we can keep growing what we're doing,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.920
we can try and get ourselves

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.720
to be the big voice in the room, when that happens.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.960
There's a quote by the famous,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.560
very right

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.680
wing American economist

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.520
Milton Friedman, which is, at times of crisis,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.920
the new solution will be chosen

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.720
from the ideas lying around at the time.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.760
Of what you can see

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.120
from the way the two main parties

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.840
have gone into this election is that we,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.800
me, this idea that the problem is inequality

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.720
is not the loudest idea lying around at the time.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.480
To be honest, if you look at the

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.160
the policies of the two main parties,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.800
it seems like

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.320
there is no idea lying around because they don't

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.480
basically don't seem to be offering anything,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.920
anything new on the economy.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.160
The biggest new idea,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.760
which is starting to get popular about the economy,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.360
you can see the Conservatives edging that way.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.160
You can see it becoming popular across Europe

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.560
and also in the US

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.320
is that the problem is immigrants,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.680
is that the problem is foreigners.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.400
You know, this is a really popular

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.640
economic idea, especially at times of crisis.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.720
It was really popular in the early 20th century.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.560
It was a big part of the reason of why

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.000
we ended up getting the Second World War.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.560
Why we ended up getting the

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.760
Holocaust, things like this.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.040
we need to make

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.040
our idea big enough

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.240
such that when the next election comes around,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.160
the two main parties can't ignore it.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.480
That's what I think, basically.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.360
And I think this election

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.680
as much as it's fantastic

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.520
that the Greens have taken up our ideas.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.480
The Greens are not going to get into power.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.240
We need to win that argument for ideas.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.320
We need to win the argument

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.360
for ideas for the next election.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.880
I think that's all we can do.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.320
That's all we can do.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.040
I think,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.920
I love football

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.040
and I love politics

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.360
for a similar reason that I love football

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.280
because I just...

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.320
I'm kind of a geeky guy

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.560
that likes these kinds of things. And,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.480
a couple of years ago,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.880
I had a two year plan for this channel,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.440
which was to grow it massively.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.640
And the book was part of that.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.360
And,

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.200
it's been massively successful,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.520
the growth of this channel has been enormous.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.080
the growth of these ideas have been enormous.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.760
The fact that we're getting these ideas

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760
more understood,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.800
more recognised by politicians,

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.840
by ordinary people, is partly

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.480
thanks to the work that I've done

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.320
and the work that you've done, sharing this.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.200
I was kind of working towards

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.800
the end of the year as my time horizon,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.920
and even though I knew we weren't

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.080
going to win anything from the election,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.720
you're kind of thinking

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.360
maybe we can get ourselves a voice.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.040
Maybe we can get ourselves a voice.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.400
the election got called earlier,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.720
and we're not in a position

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.320
to influence the main political parties.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.920
And,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.480
I think it's hard when you work so hard at something.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.800
And you, you see how far you've come on it,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.280
and you look up and you see how much further

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.320
you have to go on that thing.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.880
So basically,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.240
living standards are not going to rise

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.280
after this election.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.680
We'll get a new government.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.320
They're not going to do anything on inequality.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.640
But, you know,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.880
I never thought we would get anything

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.240
from the Conservatives,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.440
and I never thought we would get anything from Labour.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.600
And before I started this YouTube channel,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.520
I existed in the world of, like, think tanks

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.600
and newspapers.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.120
And I spoke to politicians,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.320
and I spoke to people who speak to politicians,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.280
and I still speak to people

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040
who speak to politicians now.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.760
And I made the intentional choice

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.880
to stop speaking to politicians

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.040
and start speaking to you

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.040
because I don't think that the politicians

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.960
are going to save us.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.720
I think that we have to save us.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.080
And, I think if enough of you realise that what we need

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.400
is action on inequality,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.360
what we need is a fairer tax system

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.920
that taxes the rich more and taxes working people less.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.680
I honestly believe

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.160
we can get ourselves into a situation

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.920
where when we go into an election,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.920
the political parties have to do something.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.320
And, you know, this might sound an absurd comparison,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.760
but in a weird way,

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:34.000
I sometimes take hope from Brexit because in 2015,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.480
none of the major political parties supported Brexit.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.400
They were all quite passionately against it.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.400
And

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.520
people consistently voted for parties

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.960
that were pro-Brexit to the point

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.400
where now the main political parties,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.520
they don't want to support Brexit,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.640
but they have to support Brexit

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.320
and you know,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.040
I don't necessarily think Brexit is going to save us,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.480
and I don't think Brexit necessarily

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.480
is going to get us out of this problem.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.520
But what it shows is if enough ordinary people

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.080
demand something, we do still live in a democracy

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.000
and the politicians

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.280
will eventually have to give us that. But,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.440
we're not loud enough.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.920
My voice is not loud enough.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.880
Your voice is not loud enough.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.360
but it was always going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.320
I'll be voting for the one party

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.760
that has supported my ideas.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.000
I think the first past the post

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.440
political system is stupid.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.000
I'll be swapping my vote

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.400
if it helps on vote swapping websites.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.800
Listen, there'll be people that will say

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.480
don't vote for the Greens because you need to vote for

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.520
whoever will get the Tories out.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.680
And that's a legitimate opinion.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.760
And if that's what you want to do, you can do that.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.960
I will swap my vote so that I can try and do both.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.640
I would encourage you to do what you think is best,

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.320
but also to realise,

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:54.400
don't get caught up in the hype of this election.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.560
The real battle for living

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.080
standards is a battle for distribution.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.920
It's a battle for inequality.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.280
It's a battle which unfortunately, at the moment,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.720
none of the politicians are fighting for us.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.880
I'm going to keep fighting.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.200
Well, I'm going to take a holiday, actually,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.000
because I need one.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.720
But, when I come back, I'll be fighting.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.680
And, I hope you guys will fight with me.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.600
So

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.280
don't worry too much about Rishi

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.680
Sunak and Keir Starmer.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.880
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.520
I'll keep going and I hope you guys come with me.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.520
So thanks for your support. And, we'll keep going.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.880
Thank you.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.120
Happy with that? Yeah, great man, it's great.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.520
Emotional. Yeah.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.440
It is frustrating, isn't it? You know, it just.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.080
Yeah.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.280
It's hard when you realise, like, f*****g

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.920
how much you have to work and how much harder,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.840
how much more you have to come still, you know.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.120
You know what I'll do.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.560
And you know, you can stick this in on the end

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.000
if you want. Like I'm in a safe Labour seat.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.800
I will try and swap a Green vote into a seat

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.480
that the Greens are challenging for.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.040
probably they won't want to swap with me

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.760
because

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.600
people all over the country will be trying to swap into

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.720
about four Green seats, right.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.960
So what I'll probably do is I'll vote Green here

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.480
and I'll swap a Labour vote into a marginal.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.760
Or I might even swap Lib-Dem vote into a marginal

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.040
to try and like you know

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.640
I don't, I don't want to see listen

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.680
there's people that will say

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.680
how can you support the Greens?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.440
You've got to fight the Tories and that's it.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.400
I don't disrespect that view.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.480
And there are people who say,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.240
how can you support Labour when they do this?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.720
They do that.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.920
And obviously I haven't mentioned things

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.040
they do outside of economics.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.480
But I think you can get the sense

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.520
I'm disappointed in Labour

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.000
and I appreciate that point of view as well.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.480
But I'll swap so I can try and fight both fights.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.280
And also like

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.480
I'm not going to insult people because,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.000
you know, I think

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.240
both of those views are legitimate views.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.240
I think if the Tories lose, which they do

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.960
and we get a big Labour majority,

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.880
we have a better chance than if the Tories don't lose.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.080
You know,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.640
I think if we get

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.800
a big Green vote

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.520
realistically,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.200
that the press will ignore that big Green vote.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.480
But if we get a big Green vote, it

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.840
at least is a signal,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.000
you know, and one thing I will say.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.800
I would encourage people to vote.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.240
I would encourage people to vote.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.720
And, if you can, you know, if it works for you, vote

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.440
because, you know,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.440
a lot of poor people, a lot of young people don't vote.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.160
And we get ignored.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.880
And and I know a lot of people

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.800
are discouraged with Labour

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.040
and I'm discouraged with Labour.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.240
But, you know,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.040
and maybe some people

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.240
don't like the Greens for some reason.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.440
I would encourage you to go and vote.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.120
And, you know, if you

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.360
if that means voting for an independent,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.320
if that means voting for Labour,

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.400
if that means voting for Greens,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.400
if that means voting for the Lib Dems

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.840
or the SNP to get the Tories out of,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.640
you'll see these are all legit views.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.560
Like I don't want to see ordinary people

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.320
divided by like, oh,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.600
my party is better than your party.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.320
Like I just the situation is too serious for that,

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.760
the situation is too serious for that.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.240
But more than anything.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.840
This election is not the be all and end all, you know.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.720
Go out, cast your vote, dust your hands off, move on.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.400
Because we got a long, a lot of...

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.160
we have many years of fighting ahead of us,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.040
and we can't afford to just, like,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.800
exhaust ourselves all on this one thing. For sure.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.240
Shall we just cut there?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.640
Yeah, I think so, yes. Yeah.
