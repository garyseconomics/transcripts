00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Gary Stevenson
former trader and&nbsp;people's economist

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.920
this is Gary's Economics, today we're gonna
talk about "how do we fix&nbsp;the economy"

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.200
OK hopefully by now you've watched&nbsp;my videos
you understand that wealth inequality is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.160
destroying the economy making housing
unaffordable, making jobs bad and wages low

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.320
you understand if we&nbsp;change that we can make
the economy a lot better, and you're on board

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.240
so what do we do well the&nbsp;way i see it
it's basically a three-stage process

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.960
the end goal is we wanna force powerful people
like politicians to make change, to change the tax

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.080
system so that it's fair so that super rich pay
their fair share of tax, more than the rest of us

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.200
but we're not going to be able to do that until
we build a movement and we build awareness

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.840
so for me it's a three-stage process
first we put awareness and understanding

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.360
then we build a movement and then we
force powerful people to make change

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.080
stage one of the process is we need to convince
as many people as possible that wealth inequality

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.120
is a problem, you know a lot of the media
will tell you that wealth inequality yeah

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.040
it's a problem but we need it to have a strong
economy - nothing could be further from the truth

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.400
if you look at me, my personal story i came from
nothing i made millions of pounds by understanding

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.280
one thing, wealth inequality is destroying the
economy, i'm not just saying that I've been

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.920
betting on it for 10 years and I've been right for
10 years, if we don't fix wealth inequality it means

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.520
unaffordable housing, bad jobs and no financial
security for your kids and your grandkids

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.560
if we do fix wealth inequality we could
have an economy that is so much better

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.280
wages that are higher, housing that is affordable
now look it's not going to be easy there's a lot

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.720
of millionaires and billionaires out there
that don't want you to hear this message

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.040
they're doing very well the way things
are and they don't want things to change

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.800
some of them own newspapers
some of them put a lot&nbsp;of money into

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.000
paying economists and think tanks&nbsp;to tell you
that inequality is important for the&nbsp;economy

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.200
that is not true!
look I've got no reason&nbsp;to tell you this message

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
i'm a wealthy person, i don't benefit from it
but i made my money by&nbsp;understanding and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.560
betting on the true fact that if&nbsp;we don't fix
wealth inequality the economy will be&nbsp;weaker

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.720
and weaker for future generations,
so number&nbsp;one spread that message

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.840
help ordinary people to&nbsp;understand
we need to fix wealth inequality

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.160
if we want to make the economy better
and make sure they understand that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.360
that's not about taxing&nbsp;doctors and lawyers
it's about taxing the super&nbsp;wealthy families

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.400
that get richer and richer every&nbsp;generation
by taking money from the rest of us

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.920
that's number one: awareness and understanding
number two is building a movement

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.000
look if you understand that wealth inequality
is a problem,&nbsp;then you like me

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.160
are gonna want to change the tax system
that at the moment

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.040
taxes millionaires&nbsp;and billionaires
often lower rates than cleaners

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.000
but we are not going to be able
to make that&nbsp;change happen unless

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.160
we have a powerful and big&nbsp;movement, look i'm
out here everyday making videos&nbsp;on Youtube

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.800
but i'm not gonna be able to make change
happen unless i have a big following and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.200
a lot of people are seeing it and not
just me but&nbsp;other people are on board

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.160
saying the same message, doing the same thing
so what i need you to do for&nbsp;me now

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.560
is to share this video around but not just
that, talk to your friends, talk to your family

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.280
read my website www.wealtheconomics.org
look at&nbsp;my other videos

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.160
educate the people around you, ordinary
people who are getting hurt by this system

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.120
you know it's our children who will suffer
if we don't fix this, ordinary&nbsp;people's children

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.880
so tell your friends, tell your&nbsp;work
colleagues - let them know

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.680
look i come from&nbsp;an ordinary background
i can see my sister, my friends

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.800
what's happening to their families losing
their houses not getting their financial security

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.200
tell everyone you know that we
need to fix&nbsp;wealth inequality

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.160
that's the only way we can fix the economy
politicians keep saying they're&nbsp;going to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.200
make things better but they don't do it
because they don't address wealth inequality

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.400
so tell your friends, tell your family, tell&nbsp;your
work colleagues, share my videos with them

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.280
say look this guy he comes from an
ordinary&nbsp;background he's made money

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.400
understanding this and if they're confused
send me a&nbsp;message

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.200
look i'm out there on all the socials
Facebook, Twitter, Youtube ... Instagram

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.680
all @garyseconomics, send me messages
about what people don't&nbsp;understand

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.520
so that i can address them in videos
share the stuff i do so that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.680
we can get more&nbsp;people on board
hopefully if we keep building that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.600
we can get a big movement that will
grow and then&nbsp;we can use that to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.440
force people to make change, so look
that's the way it's going to&nbsp;work

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.680
first we build the understanding
secondly we build the movement

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960
and then we&nbsp;can start forcing
politicians to do something

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.680
so for now, watch my videos, try and
understand&nbsp;what i'm saying

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.000
if you've got questions message me on my
socials share them with people around&nbsp;you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.600
if you know people who can share them to
a big audience, get them on board

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.400
and put them in&nbsp;touch with me
hopefully we can spread this message

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.920
to more and more people ordinary people
who are&nbsp;not being represented

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.200
so they can fight back to build
a better future for our kids

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.880
so that's it, three stage message
understand what i'm saying

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.640
spread it as much as you can
and then we can&nbsp;make change happen

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.080
Thank you
(yeah we're good?)
