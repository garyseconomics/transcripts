i'm sure there's a lot of problems
everywhere you go but i'm

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.160
everywhere you go but i'm

The specific thing that is different

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400
The specific thing that is different
about growing up poor

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.680
about growing up poor
in London is that if you're poor in

in London is that if you're poor in
London you're poor but you're

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080
London you're poor but you're
surrounded by Wealth

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.760
surrounded by Wealth
not just like the big skyscrapers

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.440
not just like the big skyscrapers
in the city

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.200
in the city
but there are a lot of people that

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.360
but there are a lot of people that
have quite a lot of money right

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.480
have quite a lot of money right

&amp; theres a lot of people who earn
quite a lot of money

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.680
and i think a big thing that made it
different for me you know

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.640

as you know i got into a

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.200

and then i went to a school where
most of the people were from sort of

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.000
most of the people were from sort of
comfortable, relatively well-off families

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.840
comfortable, relatively well-off families
when i went to their houses

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.360

Pakistani immigrants you know like fresh
over and a lot of them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.680
over and a lot of them
their houses obviously their cultural

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.360
their houses obviously their cultural
background was different to mine

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.960
background was different to mine
but their financial situation was quite

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.240
but their financial situation was quite
similar you know you entered a house it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.400
similar you know you entered a house it
was like a crowded house

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.040
he had to stay with that split and i
remember thinking like this guy's got a

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.120
remember thinking like this guy's got a
stairway that splits

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.960
stairway that splits
you know i mean and like i was sharing

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360

and um if you're poor but everyone
around you is poor

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.960
around you is poor
i'm not saying that's easy but it's a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.680
i'm not saying that's easy but it's a
it's harder in the sense when you're

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.000
it's harder in the sense when you're
poor and there's so many people around

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.520
poor and there's so many people around
you who are rich

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.560
you who are rich
because it puts a difference between you

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.520
because it puts a difference between you
and i remember like non-uniform day on

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.800
and i remember like non-uniform day on
uniform day right i didn't have nothing

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000
uniform day right i didn't have nothing
to wear you know what i mean everyone

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.720
to wear you know what i mean everyone
else are like

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.200
else are like
people not some people wearing all these

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.360
people not some people wearing all these
designer clothes i didn't have nothing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.720
designer clothes i didn't have nothing
to wear and eventually i just started i

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.680
to wear and eventually i just started i
started wearing school uniform on

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
started wearing school uniform on
non-uniform day you know

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
non-uniform day you know
because i didn't have nothing to wear

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.640
because i didn't have nothing to wear
*I had no idea thats why...*

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.720
*I had no idea thats why...*
yeah because it's just like

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.680
yeah because it's just like
i'm not going to play this game

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.480
i'm not going to play this game
like it's setup against me

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.040
like it's setup against me
but i think

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.400
but i think
yeah when you see

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.200
yeah when you see
all that wealth around you what that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.640
all that wealth around you what that
and your poor

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.680
and your poor
what that does to you is first of all

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.200
what that does to you is first of all
it makes you want it it makes you want

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.680
it makes you want it it makes you want
it so badly

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.840
it so badly
i think like it's difficult to be poor

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.200
i think like it's difficult to be poor
but when you're surrounded by people

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.480
but when you're surrounded by people
who have things you don't have

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.560
who have things you don't have
you know what i mean

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.360
you know what i mean
um you know like i remember

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.000
um you know like i remember
when we all turned like

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.480
when we all turned like
16/17 &amp; everyone else was getting

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.200
16/17 &amp; everyone else was getting
driving lessons and they got cars

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.440
driving lessons and they got cars
and i couldn't get one

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.840
and i couldn't get one
you know what i mean

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.640
you know what i mean
what that highlights to you is

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.680
what that highlights to you is
also how unfair it is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.080
also how unfair it is
because like you'll probably remember i

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.760
because like you'll probably remember i
started doing a paper at 13

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.280
started doing a paper at 13
364 days a year i was waking up every

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.360
364 days a year i was waking up everY

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.720
single day, 6:45
going out to deliver papers

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.120
going out to deliver papers
and no one else was doing that in our

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840
and no one else was doing that
in our school and i was the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.760
in our school and i was the
poorest kid in school

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.200
poorest kid in school
you know i mean it's like um so i'm the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.760
you know i mean it's like um so i'm the
only one who's actually working

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.480
only one who's actually working
i'm working every single day of the year

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.080
i'm working every single day of the year
except for christmas day and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.200
except for christmas day and
everyone else has got more money than me

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.560
everyone else has got more money than me
and when time comes around for like

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.920
and when time comes around for like
who's going to get a car

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.400
who's going to get a car
everyone gets a car except me you know

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.560
everyone gets a car except me
you know what i mean and then like

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.280
you know what i mean and then like
people judge you, like i remember one

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.080
people judge you, like i remember one
time i was hanging out with some

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.280
time i was hanging out with some
girls and they was like "oh have you seen

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.480
girls and they was like "oh have you seen
Raj's new car

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.920
Raj's new car
he must be doing really well"

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.720
he must be doing really well"
&amp; i was thinking like we're 17

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.400
&amp; i was thinking like we're 17
what do you think he's doing

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.200
what do you think he's doing
you know what i mean? but like

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.640
you know what i mean? but like
people judge you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.360
people judge you
on your financial position

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
on your financial position
when you're a teenager

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.200
when you're a teenager
they do and it's stupid but they do

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.320
they do and it's stupid but they do
and people know that you're poor

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.440
and people know that you're poor
when you're 15/16

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.720
when you're 15/16
it can't possibly be your fault that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.280
it can't possibly be your fault that
you're poor you know what i mean

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.560
you're poor you know what i mean
i was doing everything i could

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.600
i was doing everything i could
i was working a paper round and i was 15.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.160
i was working a paper round and i was 15.
what else could i do? you know what i mean?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.840
what else could i do? you know what i mean?
waking up 6:45 every day for £12 a week

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.880
waking up 6:45 every day for £12 a week
you know and i have to save

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.600
you know and i have to save
up every every week

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.880
up every every week
but i think that's the specific thing

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.000
but i think that's the specific thing
about growing up poor in london

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.360
because you're surrounded by so much

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.120
because you're surrounded by so much
wealth you want it so badly

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.840
wealth you want it so badly
and i think that's nowadays with the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.800
and i think that's nowadays with the
growth of things like

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.720
growth of things like
instagram and facebook where

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.320
instagram and facebook where
it's become like quite fashionable for

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.720
it's become like quite fashionable for
people to really sort of casually

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.160
people to really sort of casually
display

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.040
display
the things that they have like holidays

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.560
the things that they have like holidays
or like cars or like watches or clothes

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.240
or like cars or like watches or clothes
you know in a sense i thought

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.600
you know in a sense i thought
we were lucky that we

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.440
we were lucky that we
grew up a little bit before that era

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.160
grew up a little bit before that era
where it wasn't so easy to

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.440
where it wasn't so easy to
display your wealth but now

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.320
display your wealth but now
i think kids are probably on

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.880
i think kids are probably on
instagram from like i don't know

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.600
instagram from like i don't know
10 or 11 or maybe younger

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.440
10 or 11 or maybe younger
and then they're gonna see all of these

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.360
and then they're gonna see all of these
displays of how much wealth and things

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.080
displays of how much wealth and things
other people have

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.520
other people have
and it's always displayed beautifully on

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.120
and it's always displayed beautifully on
instagram that's only gonna make it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.600
instagram that's only gonna make it
worse right kids are gonna see that kids

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.000
worse right kids are gonna see that kids
from poor backgrounds

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.680
from poor backgrounds

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.360
you can't be surprised when they get
addicted to online training

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.520
addicted to online training

like fraud you know what i mean
because a big

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.720
because a big
factor which i think is really important

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.240
factor which i think is really important
is um

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.160
back one generation ago like we're here

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.720
back one generation ago like we're here
in Ilford it's got a massive indian

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.560
in Ilford it's got a massive indian
community massive Pakistani community

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.680
community massive Pakistani community
a lot of our friends they came over from

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.840
a lot of our friends they came over from
India, Pakistan, East Africa

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.680
India, Pakistan, East Africa
one generation, two generations ago

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.000
one generation, two generations ago
with nothing, with not a penny to their name

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.960
with nothing, with not a penny to their name
and they worked and they worked and

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.880
and they worked and they worked and
they worked and they saved and they saved

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.280
they worked and they saved and they saved
and they saved and a lot of those families

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.280
and they saved and a lot of those families
are pretty wealthy now you know

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.440
are pretty wealthy now you know
they've got multiple properties

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.880
they've got multiple properties
they're really comfortable, they've got a nice

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.720
they're really comfortable, they've got a nice
quality/standard of living

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.280
quality/standard of living
so they lived in an era where

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.800
so they lived in an era where
even if you grew up in London and saw

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.600
even if you grew up in London and saw
this wealth around you

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.560
this wealth around you
It was true that if you're willing

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.000
It was true that if you're willing
to pull your socks up

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to pull your socks up
and work really hard you could get it

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.080
and work really hard you could get it
you could get it so as long as you

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.560
you could get it so as long as you
you know maybe you needed to make a lot

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.680
you know maybe you needed to make a lot
of sacrifices and you know you know

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.560
of sacrifices and you know you know
very well a lot of our parents

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.720
very well a lot of our parents
and our friends parents

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720
and our friends parents
did make massive sacrifices

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.680
did make massive sacrifices
if you are willing to make your

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.720
if you are willing to make your
sacrifice you can get those things but

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.880
sacrifice you can get those things but
the problem is now

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880
the problem is now
increasingly for young people that's not

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.520
increasingly for young people that's not
true so then you're putting young people

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.720
true so then you're putting young people
you know especially young men who are

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.000
you know especially young men who are
very often judged

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.160
very often judged
really strictly on their financial

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.960
really strictly on their financial
success you're putting them in a

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.160
success you're putting them in a
situation where they've got nothing

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.360
situation where they've got nothing
they're surrounded by people

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.560
they're surrounded by people
who've got things they can't have

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.680
who've got things they can't have
they're seeing it displayed to them on

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.600
they're seeing it displayed to them on
instagram every single day

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.800
instagram every single day
they're seeing it on the tv, in the movies

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.720
they're seeing it on the tv, in the movies
on advertisements every single day

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.240
movies on advertisements every single day
but no matter how hard they work

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.720
but no matter how hard they work
no matter what they do

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.280
no matter what they do
they can never get that stuff

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.080
they can never get that stuff
like what is that, right?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.520
like what is that, right?
that is the recipe for a mental health

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.800
that is the recipe for a mental health
disaster for young men - that's what it is

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.360
disaster for young men - that's what it is
if you create a situation where

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.440
if you create a situation where
you create a desperate urgent need

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.720
you create a desperate urgent need
and you surround someone with other

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.840
and you surround someone with other
people who have a thing

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.680
people who have a thing
and you tell them they can't have it and

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.720
and you tell them they can't have it and
you don't give them any legitimate route

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.120
you don't give them any legitimate route
to getting that thing

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.400
to getting that thing
you cannot be surprised when these

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.160
you cannot be surprised when these
people turn to crime and these people

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.880
people turn to crime and these people
turn to dangerous means of getting it

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.800
turn to dangerous means of getting it
like online trading and stuff like this um

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.000
like online trading and stuff like this um
and that's what I've seen in my opinion

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.120
and that's what I've seen in my opinion
a massive increase in

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.600
a massive increase in
online trading and gambling

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.360
online trading and gambling
gambling addictions because

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.280
gambling addictions because
we've created a generation of young men

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.160
we've created a generation of young men
who have had

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.600
who have had
wealth and financial success

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.240
wealth and financial success
shoved down their throats for their whole

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.440
shoved down their throats for their whole
childhood and have no legitimate means

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.280
childhood and have no legitimate means
of getting those things

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.160
and yeah that i think
that's what happened

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.560
that's what happened
and yeah what i was saying before was

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.000
and yeah what i was saying before was
like i think another thing which really

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.560
like i think another thing which really
drives financial anxiety is when

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.240
drives financial anxiety is when
things change in the economy very

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.440
things change in the economy very quickly
so like if you have a society which is

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.240
so like if you have a society which is
very unequal

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.320
very unequal
but things are not moving quickly then i

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.240
but things are not moving quickly then i
think poor people will

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.120
think poor people will
just accept we're poor like yeah

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.920
just accept we're poor like yeah
it's not good it's s*** we're poor but

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.960
it's not good it's s*** we're poor but
we have a community of poor people and

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.440
we have a community of poor people and
we're all the same i'm all equal but

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.080
we're all the same i'm all equal but
what we've done in our society is we've

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.800
what we've done in our society is we've
shuffled the deck really really quickly

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.640
shuffled the deck really really quickly
so for our parents generation like I've

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.160
so for our parents generation like I've
said it was true

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.920
said it was true
that a lot of them were poor but as long

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.040
that a lot of them were poor but as long
as they worked hard they could become

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.760
as they worked hard they could become
relatively rich

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.040
but for our generation that's not true

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.160
but for our generation that's not true
so what that means is

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.800
so what that means is
we've moved very quickly from a world

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.480
we've moved very quickly from a world
where

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.800
where
everybody had that basic ability

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.360
everybody had that basic ability
to get themselves financially secure to

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.920
to get themselves financially secure to
one where whether you can be financially

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.000
one where whether you can be financially
secure or not

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.360
secure or not
is actually out of your control and it

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.320
is actually out of your control and it
depends on what your parents and your

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.080
depends on what your parents and your
grandparents did

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.000
grandparents did
so what that means is then we bear that

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.600
so what that means is then we bear that
responsibility of

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.480
responsibility of
well that means if i don't make it my

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.720
well that means if i don't make it my
kids are screwed

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.920
kids are screwed
you know what i mean because we lived in

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.320
you know what i mean because we lived in
a world where

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.480
a world where
even if you were poor you could become

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.080
even if you were poor you could become
rich so that means like all i need to do

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.240
rich so that means like all i need to do
is make sure that my kids are healthy

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.800
is make sure that my kids are healthy
and happy and then they can make it for

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.360
and happy and then they can make it for
themselves but now we've moved into a

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.880
themselves but now we've moved into a
world where

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040
world where
if you can't give your kids a big

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.560
if you can't give your kids a big
inheritance

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.360
inheritance
then they'll probably never get a house

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.720
then they'll probably never get a house
so what that means is it's not enough

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.760
so what that means is it's not enough
for me to be a good father it's not enough for

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.280
for me to be a good father it's not enough for
me to give my *kids* a stable happy childhood

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.760
me to give my *kids* a stable happy childhood
i need to make money otherwise they will

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.920
i need to make money otherwise they will
not be financially secure

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.800
not be financially secure
so then suddenly

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.200
so then suddenly
people are in a situation where it's not

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.880
people are in a situation where it's not
just their necks on the line you know

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.240
just their necks on the line you know
it's not just a case of can i get a nice

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.200
it's not just a case of can i get a nice
holiday or not

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.920
holiday or not
you know it's not a case of can i get a

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.800
you know it's not a case of can i get a
nice car it's literally a case of if you

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.320
nice car it's literally a case of if you
don't make it

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.320
don't make it
your kids will not be financially secure

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.680
your kids will not be financially secure
and that's what happens when you create

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.120
and that's what happens when you create
an economy

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.440
an economy
where only kids from rich families can

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.720
where only kids from rich families can
buy houses

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.160
buy houses
that means i need to be rich or my kids

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.000
that means i need to be rich or my kids
will be poor

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.360
will be poor
so suddenly there's so much more

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.800
so suddenly there's so much more
pressure on individuals

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.440
pressure on individuals
because you

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.480
because you
need to build that money in order for

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.880
need to build that money in order for
your kids to have a chance

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.240
your kids to have a chance
and that's what happens when you create

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.800
and that's what happens when you create
a society where rich families always stay rich

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800
a society where rich families always stay rich
and poor families always stay poor

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.800
and poor families always stay poor
but we're going to decide now which

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.040
but we're going to decide now which
families are going to be in the rich and

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.360
families are going to be in the rich and
which families are gonna be in the poor

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.640
which families are gonna be in the poor
so then it's like oh my god i need to

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.000
so then it's like oh my god i need to
work really hard really quickly i need

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.120
work really hard really quickly i need
to make that cut

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.160
to make that cut
because i'm seeing people

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.240
because i'm seeing people
you know like your parents &amp; my parents

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.840
you know like your parents &amp; my parents
come from similar financial backgrounds

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.800
come from similar financial backgrounds
but now they're in very different

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.640
but now they're in very different
financial places right and that's affecting

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.000
