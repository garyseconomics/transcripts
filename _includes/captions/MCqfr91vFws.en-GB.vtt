00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.720
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.600
Today we have got a guest on the channel.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm introducing Jimmy the Giant.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.720
Is that what we’re calling you? Yes.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240
So Jimmy the Giant has a YouTube channel

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.120
where he talks politics, economics, subcultures.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.440
He's got a video on there

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040
called How I Escaped the Alt-Right Pipeline,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.520
which talks about how

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.040
he was a big fan of Jordan Peterson. Yeah.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.600
And how he's been watching a lot of stuff.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.760
He's been watching our channel,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.880
and it's made him more skeptical about

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.960
these rightwing ideas, it’s

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.280
made him more interested in inequality, economics.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.440
A lot of people have been messaging saying

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.440
we should chat.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.400
I’ve been wanting to get more people on, basically

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.000
to talk about what we're doing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.840
More YouTubers, people

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
who are talking about the same thing.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.960
So, welcome to the channel, Jimmy. Hello. Hello.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.520
Really, the main thing I wanted to talk about,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.120
the main reason I wanted to have you on is because.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.400
So,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.800
as you know,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.960
I've been doing this thing for a while, right where

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.400
I'm trying to create a space where

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.480
people who are worried about the economy can come.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.080
They feel like welcomed.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.400
They feel like they can understand what's happening.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.360
They feel like empowered,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.880
and they can just develop this understanding

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.240
in a way that's like, not,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.600
like a non-hostile space.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.960
Because the way I see it is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.520
bringing people to the YouTube...

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.760
look, at the end of the day, what I'm doing,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.840
I'll be straight with it, it’s a political project.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.200
Yeah, yeah. It's a political project.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
And

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.920
this might sound,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.080
I honestly think there is nothing

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.360
more powerful politicising

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.080
than giving people

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.760
a good understanding of what's happening. Yeah.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.280
Because the reality of what's happening here

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.960
is just going to get worse.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.520
And I think this so,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.240
I just shot a Musk video before this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.200
and I know you're going to shoot one.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.920
He's the gift that keeps giving for content.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.520
He's going to be funding a lot of this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.440
like anti-immigrant rhetoric right. Yeah.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.840
Obviously we are never going to be able to compete

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600
for funding with people like Elon Musk.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.400
Where we can compete is,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840
the reality of the situation is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.960
if we keep going in this direction,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.280
poverty will get worse and more

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.040
and more people will be in poverty.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.920
And they can never say that.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.720
Yeah.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.680
Well, I mean, they will say that, and they’ll say it’s

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.760
because of immigration.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.080
This is one I've been kind of confused about is like,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.160
this is about immigration,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.000
but it ties obviously into economics.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.880
Why would right-wingers who are in big businesses

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.920
like an Elon Musk,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.200
I think I understand for Elon,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.280
but there's other examples.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.840
Why would they be anti-immigration?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.160
Because for them, obviously immigration

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.720
is better for their business largely.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
So by the time this comes out

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.520
my Musk video be out and it's described in there.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.880
But I'll go through it.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.760
I mean to be honest,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.440
this the way I see it, the way I see it,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.280
it makes total sense, right. Because

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.840
in my opinion, economy is going to keep getting worse

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360
in terms of living standards.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.400
And it's already been getting worse for a long time.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.360
And people are super,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.720
super unhappy with the status quo,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.000
with the way things are.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.120
So if things keep getting worse,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.160
people demand some sort of change on the economy.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.600
They're like,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.880
we know that this direction is not working.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000
We need something else.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.720
There's this quote from Milton Friedman,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.960
which is like at times of crisis,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.080
the alternative will be chosen

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.760
from the ideas lying around at the time.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960
So we are in a state in society now,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.040
I think anybody really smart recognises

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.680
we're going downhill. Yeah.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.280
And as you keep going downhill

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.760
eventually politically in democracies,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.000
some kind of change has to be sold to the public.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.240
So then we're looking around and we’re like,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.360
okay, what are the alternatives?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.160
It's really, really obvious

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.840
what the number one loudest,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
most popular alternative is right now.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.280
Like is these anti-immigrant,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.840
anti-foreigner political parties

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840
massively growing in popularity all over the world.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.280
They are the loudest voice.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.720
What's the second loudest voice?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.480
I honestly think the second largest voice is us.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.080
Not just me, but like, you know,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.440
you look at this,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.360
Luigi Manzoni, you know, the support for him.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.160
The alternative is Yeah, tax the rich.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.120
And the right uses all...

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.960
That's always what populist right does.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.280
It takes elements of populist left rhetoric.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.080
So they will be anti corporations.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.360
Like you see this weird

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.520
crossover where very rightwing

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.360
people will be anti corporations

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.800
or anti certain billionaires.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.640
Because for them it's always about making a scapegoat.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.400
And you can do that within even the billionaire class.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.600
You can say like,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.520
you can say billionaires are great like these people.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.600
They fund our economy, they make jobs.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.680
But it's those billionaires

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.880
and they always tend to end up

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440
being the ones they don't like,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.600
which is always the Jewish ones.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.240
So they'll point out to George Soros and, you know,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.200
certain ones.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.440
That's maybe a little less true,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.200
because they also point out,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.480
like Bill gates and stuff like that,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.760
but they'll pick certain ones.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.320
Maybe the ones that align to like,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.800
it seems actually more it's

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.920
the ones that maybe have some left wing

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.880
values or something

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.520
they pick, say, the left wing billionaires,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.800
the ones who are bringing the world down,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.000
but they understand that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.760
Yeah, well, everyone's always looking for an enemy.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.440
In a time of crisis,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.760
you're looking for an enemy,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.880
and they understand

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.440
that, the billionaires understand that

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.680
and they are looking for, well,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.920
how do we make it not us?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.200
How do we keep some form of the status quo

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.560
but it's not us gets targeted?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.600
So we pick these billionaires and these migrants.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.560
Yeah, I think

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560
these guys have lots and lots

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.080
and lots and lots of money.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.920
And I think they understand

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240
on like a pretty simple level,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160
we need

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.760
to fund

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.040
really

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.880
any potentially popular narrative Yeah.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.920
that is not blaming us. Yeah.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.240
Ultimately not a lot of people put money into

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.280
like funding this narrative building. Yeah.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.720
So the billionaires don't need to pay that much

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.680
to kind of dominate the narrative the narrative. Right.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.640
Because also it's like,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.400
this is the thing I came

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.760
to the enlightenment of, and it's crazy

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.320
it took me some f**king long,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.200
but it was like

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.160
there is the separation of left

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.120
wing economics, the left wing social values.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720
So the way that a right-winger

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.240
can look at the world and say it's overrun by leftist

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.080
is because they're talking about social values

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.080
and they're talking about like LGBT representation,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.520
discussions on race, discussions on gender.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.520
They consider that the left.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.480
Whereas you could,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.920
I mean, you can literally not believe

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.640
in any of those things.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.080
You could be a racist lefty on economics,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.760
but right wing on social values,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.280
so they can paint the world

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.720
as being overrun by leftists

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.240
where we're so right wing on economics.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.400
And because people don't have this education

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.280
of understanding this terminology,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.640
it gets so confusing.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.280
Because they can say, oh look at the left and their,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.200
you know, LGBT flags

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.680
on Oxford Street and blah, blah, blah,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.760
we’re controlled by the left.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.080
And you’re like,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.760
but bruv, we have like f**king

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.840
foreign billionaires own our water,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.640
they own our f**king railway.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.920
It's like,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.120
it'd be insane to think that we're left

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.200
on economics in this country.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.000
I mean, we have obviously some safety nets.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.720
Yeah But that's

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.080
how they perceive the world from this lens.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.960
And it's like,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.520
that's a level of education

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.600
people need to start understanding.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.400
That separation of left wing social values

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.760
and left wing economic values.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.520
And that's the thing I try...

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.360
I talk a lot on economics. Yeah.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.560
Because I personally believe like a lot of social

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.320
things are downstream of economics. So I think you,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.280
in societies where it's more equal,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280
you probably find there's less discrimination.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.280
So I sort of believe in that rising tide floats

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.320
all boats in this premise where it's like,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.600
if we can reduce inequality,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.480
if we can raise people's living standards,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.840
you'll probably find less racists,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.400
and you'll probably find that people get along,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.720
maybe, not 100%.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.640
You still need to put efforts into those things,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.080
but I think you have, this is like putting your...

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.120
I think when you over focus on like the social issues,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.400
you're putting your cart

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.720
before your horse for the cart,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.920
whatever the f**king expression.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.840
Yeah. I mean, you know, you know, I do like.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.160
I just, I barely speak about social issues.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.320
I mean, the only reason I've,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.080
I've been talking a little bit

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.920
more about immigration recently,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.960
and I'll tell you exactly why.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.480
I'm not an expert on social issues, right.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.480
You know, and I'm not an expert on immigration.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.760
I'm an expert on economics.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.680
The reason I’ve started thinking

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.000
about immigration is because

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.160
I started seeing it in the comments.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
I started seeing in the comments.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.480
Yeah, yeah. It’s all I get..

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.480
Obviously my channel’s called Gary’s Economics.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.600
We talk about economics, right?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.520
And

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.120
it was about a year ago,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.880
maybe more, like a year and a half.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.880
I started to see,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.320
people talking about immigration in the comments

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.000
and I was

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.200
quite confused initially because,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.480
like, immigration

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.480
was not really previously seen as an economic issue

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.880
and it first started popping up here and there and,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.800
then it started popping up more

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.400
and more and more and more and more.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.240
And I started to see

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.000
some people are definitely being told the reason

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.680
you’re poor is because of immigration.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.520
That's everyone's been told that by everything.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.280
Yeah, I remember I was watching...

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.920
so I watch like BBC news,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.280
Sky news every morning

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.680
when I'm eating my breakfast because I want to see

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.840
like what people are being told.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.280
Still you watch, this is what you watch now?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.160
Yeah still, still, still.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.040
I don't watch a lot of like alternative economic stuff

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.400
because what I want...

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.360
I want to know what the majority of people

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.800
are being told. What is the mainstream narrative.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.320
That's probably from your...

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.720
That's probably what made you good at economics,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.880
because when you were in the book,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.960
you were talking about asking your mates

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.600
why they're struggling in the economy

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.000
rather than reading stuff

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.880
because you're trying to get

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.160
like you're trying to see the world

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.560
from the perspective of the people you want to help.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.280
Yeah.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.600
To be honest it probably related a little bit to

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.280
when I was a trader, because as a trader,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.320
for me it was always these two things.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.040
It was like, what's the reality? What's the reality?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.240
What's going to happen?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.360
But the time you make money as a trader

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.680
is when the reality is different from the popularly

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.000
perceived opinion.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.680
Like if people are right about something,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.440
then the prices are right and there's no money.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.600
Like when there's money as a trader

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.320
is when there's a big gap between what's real

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.200
and what most people think.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.240
So this is where the market is like

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.560
saying, this thing’s good, but you’re

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.480
seeing it, that in reality, this isn’t like this.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.160
Yes, for me when I look at market,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.520
you know,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.600
I don't know if you've seen these trading floors,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.040
they have all these screens with all these numbers.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.960
Right.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.000
It sounds like bulls**t.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.480
But like when I see those numbers, it's like a forecast

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.880
for what's going to happen.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.120
Like those numbers to me

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.880
are like a weather forecast like this,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.320
you know, in six months time this will happen.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.280
In three months time this happened, blah, blah, blah.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.440
And I'm looking at that forecast and I'm saying,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.640
is that really going to happen?

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.520
Is that really going to happen?

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.760
So like, you know, my big trade was after

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.720
2008 saying rates and stay low,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.040
people thought rates would go high.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.360
And that was basically because they thought

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.440
the economy would recover. Interesting.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.720
How did you have the like

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.920
I know, sort of tangent,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.360
but how did you have the confidence

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.120
because you were new in that job,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.040
I suppose, at that point, you’d

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.520
only been there a couple of years?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:37.960
Well,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.960
I didn't really start betting on it until early 2011,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.480
by which time I'd been full time for

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.720
just over two and a half years.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.360
Because I'd be

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.360
I'd be like, wow, I'm too new at this job.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.400
I'm probably like, wrong.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.800
Maybe I have this intuition.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.360
But probably I'm wrong.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.280
But, you know, the thing is, like.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.000
I went to LSE, you know, like, so I was like,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.680
quite like a talented student in my primary school.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.720
And then I went to grammar school, and

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.160
I was kind of like the smartest kid

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.040
in the grammar school.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.280
You know, and then I went to LSE

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.080
and I thought LSE would be full of smart kids.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.160
But the maddest thing about LSE in particular.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.840
You know about LSE, right?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.600
LSE, for those who don't know,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600
London School of Economics,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.360
like a very fancy economics university London and, and,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.120
loads and loads of foreign students.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.280
I don't want to disrespectful to the foreign students

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.240
at LSE right.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240
A lot of these guys are not that smart.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.400
Of course some of them are.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.240
But at the end of the day,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.720
the truth is

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.000
they're there because they're from very rich families.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.560
Yeah.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.760
And and the thing is, they don't even, often

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.320
they don't even need to be smart.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.640
Yeah.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.360
Because they're going to go home

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.720
and they're going to work like for like the government

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.400
or like for their dad's company or...

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.080
Some of the kids

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.160
dummest kids I've ever met were dumb as f**k.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.960
And they're there.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.160
The truth is, a lot of these guys

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.120
go to LSE to find a husband or a wife.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.880
I know that sounds mad, But the thing is...

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.680
And they work for Goldman Sachs for a few years

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.760
and then they go, so they...

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.920
and then when I went into the trading,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.280
when I went to trade, I remember being like one...

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.680
like one game theory class in third year LSE.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.360
And the professor asked this question.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.600
It was, I thought it was quite an easy question.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.280
And he asked one guy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.240
Nothing. Another guy.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.240
Nothing. Another guy. Nothing. Another.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.200
They don't, they don't f**king care.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.920
They don't care.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.240
And then they're going to go

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.360
and they're going to memorise

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.920
the last five years of exam papers,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.280
and they're going to get like 71,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.800
and it's going to be good enough for them,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.480
you know what I mean? Like, and.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.520
How do you make like...

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.080
this is one of the ones that drives me insane.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.800
I used to believe it,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.200
and it's funny how much I flipped, but

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.920
how do you make someone who's, like, on the right

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.600
understand that, like

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.360
meritocracy in that sense, like,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.880
the smartest kid will not be the one that wins

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.320
like that?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.200
Yeah, it is literally, I have met so many people,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.960
and I think

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.280
if most people really are honest about life,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.000
they will have noticed wealthy people who are dumb

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.640
and like they just had good backgrounds.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.960
Like, I've seen that a lot.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.560
I think

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.680
luckily from having went to,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.840
I went to like public school

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.880
and then I went to a private school.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.880
My parent’s got like inheritance.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.960
So I went to like a private school.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.520
All the kids were loaded.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.320
And I saw quite a few of them are dumb

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.160
but obviously they’re kids.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.480
But then when I got older, I worked in marketing.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.000
And then you start like going to these f**king...

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.040
I'd be getting taken

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.080
to like these manor houses and stuff

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.400
where they would rent the whole place

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.080
out to have a marketing...

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.480
I don't know what we were doing.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.320
We were just like,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.280
I don't know what we were talking about,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.040
but they would talk and discuss bulls**t

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.880
and you would meet some of the thickest people,

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880
like really dumb people,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.680
and they're in like senior positions

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.240
or at least doing well.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.680
And it's like,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.480
how do you break through to like, average

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.280
people who are maybe on the right

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.160
where they really believe this idea

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.360
that if you really work hard,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.040
you will get ahead and you will win. Oh my.....

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.320
Do you want to ask your question again,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.440
just in case we want to include one

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.920
where you don't spill a cup of coffee. Yeah.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.120
So how do you get through to like people

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.360
that have really bought into this idea of meritocracy?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.320
That is so clear.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.640
Like, how do you get through to them

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.600
that just the smartest person doesn't win?

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.200
That isn't true.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.280
I've met a lot of smart people who,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.480
like Akala talked about.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.120
It was like some of the smartest people I've ever met

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.880
were drug dealers,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.640
or they went to jail and stuff like that,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.040
and it's like it doesn't correlate.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.760
It is literally your background plays

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.400
such a massive role.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.600
I tell you what, I think

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.440
it's difficult

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.400
to get through to people like that when they're young.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:26.920
Yeah.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.520
And, you know, I look at my demographics on the channel

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.520
and we do really well at like 25-35, 35-45.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.680
We don't do that well with 24 and under.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.280
I’m the same.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.000
And

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.800
I think the reason why is when you're 24 and under

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.480
and always like this when I was 24 under, you’re on it.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.880
You're going for it.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.920
You’re trying to make it,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.240
you're trying to make your money

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.080
and like maybe to some degree

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.720
you believe if I go for it,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.480
if I'm going to run for it, I'm going to make it right.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.760
Very few people above 25 believe that.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.080
Yeah, yeah, It’s so true.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.800
Because the truth is, once you're older than 25,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.600
if you have any visibility, like, of people

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.720
from different class backgrounds, you realise, f**k

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.160
me literally everyone

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.800
I know is exactly as rich as their dad. Yeah.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.480
And you realise it like, you know, like.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.600
I come from a poor background

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.960
and then I went to like LSE, I and went to Oxford.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.600
Even the kids, you go to LSE

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.640
or, well,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.560
even the kids go to LSE

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.480
that come from poor backgrounds.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.200
They don't get good jobs.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.040
The vast majority of them don't get good jobs.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.880
And even the ones that were smart.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.440
And you know like,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.960
I was like, well I was one of the top students at LSE,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.120
my grades were like one of the best,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.120
some of the best grades in the whole university.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.920
You've read my book.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.000
I got my job by cheating in a fucking card game.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.160
Yeah, yeah. Like that is the way. Like it’s...

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:49.120
Like there are so few people,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.280
I'm literally trying to think of a single person I know

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.240
other than me

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.760
that has significantly

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.800
like transitioned upwards, like in terms of,

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.120
like where they land. Yeah, yeah.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.080
Like I used to think, you know, when I was,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.800
I was like, definitely.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:00.920
Yeah.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.200
When you're younger, you're so right.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.040
When you're younger,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.800
you just don't want to be a f**king nihilistic person,

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.480
because you want to have some hope in life.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.600
You want to think like,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.320
if I work hard, I can get ahead.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.080
But it's funny for me

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.040
how my attitude flipped from pre being like,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.160
kind of like successful now

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.680
before I was super like,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.760
anyone can make it, you just have to work hard.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.440
I was looking around,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.280
I was looking at all my friends

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.800
who were like doing well and the ones who weren’t.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.520
And I was like, the ones who aren't doing well,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.600
they're not working hard.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.200
And so I made, you know, I was like, got some success.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.160
And then my attitude completely changed

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.440
because I started to realise that

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.200
the reason I got success ultimately

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.160
really comes down to the fact

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.720
that my parents own their house.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.280
I didn't have to move out of the house

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.600
until I was out 25, so my parents...

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.520
and I didn't go to uni.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.560
My parents just allowed me to d**k around for like

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.280
eight years. I was just allowed to...

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.720
I told them, I'm going to make a clothing brand,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.680
I'm going to make a vegan food stand.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.040
And they, you know, they didn't charge me rent.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.920
And so I'm already like all those factors

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.440
already not having to get out.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.960
So I didn't have to get a full time job,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.040
didn't have to pay rent.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.720
So I have so much more time to take opportunities.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.560
So meritocracy,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.320
I do sort of believe

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.280
that meritocracy exists in the middle class.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.480
If you're in a position where you have some comfort

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.000
and you haven't got to jump into some life commitment

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.440
at the age of 18 of some job,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.200
because you need to make rent,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.680
you can have like 6 or 7 years to figure s**t out,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.040
take chances. And it's a game of probability.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.400
Like the more chances you take, one of them will pop.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.280
And for me, it worked out.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.160
By the end of it, I'd gone and done a lot of hard work.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.600
But the reason being I could do that

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.320
is because I had all that extra free time,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.840
that most people didn't f**king have.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.520
The reason my YouTube career popped off

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.120
was because I got furloughed

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.600
for two months as one of my videos went viral,

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.680
so I had two two months just to work on YouTube videos.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.720
So I had the time.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.840
I think, one thing I've been,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840
I've been wanting to talk about this

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.600
for a while, actually.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.160
One thing about social mobility is,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.880
social mobility exists at a very zoomed in scale.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.920
So what I mean is if you take two people

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.560
from the same like financial background,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.080
you know, two kids grow up next door to each other

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
on the same street.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.040
If one of them, like, works really, really, really hard

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.800
and studies really, really hard.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.880
And the other one, you know, sits around smoking weed.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.240
Yeah.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.320
Like most chances

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.640
this guy will end up richer than that guy. Yeah.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.600
But if there's a kid, like ten minutes

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.440
down in the nice neighborhood.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.320
He's from a much richer family.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.920
That kid can sit around and smoke weed.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.600
You’ll never catch him.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.120
Yeah, yeah, You’ll never catch him.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.520
What I mean is, like.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.760
So it is true for people...

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.280
and what that means is then

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.840
social mobility seems real

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.360
because people compare themselves

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.480
to people on the same level.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.160
I always remember... It's the same for me, man.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.480
Yeah, my dad, my dad,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.880
he won't like me calling him out on this,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.320
but my dad is like he's a little bit Reformy,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.480
you know what I mean like.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.840
They all are.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.560
There's a lot of people supporting Reform, right?

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.120
So we shouldn't take the...

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.280
we shouldn't mock it, right.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.920
My dad is a bit like that. Yeah.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.280
And he was like,

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.800
he was this kind of, you know, we just work hard.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.360
We get our head down, you know,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.960
we don't like point fingers.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.920
We don't look at the rich and,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.960
There's that Thatcher era,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.800
that comes off the back that. He went... Yeah, yeah.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.040
And he was like, he was like a big Thatcher fan.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.080
And he probably was the generation that won off that.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.880
Yeah, he was like 21/22 when Thatcher came in

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.520
and they thought it was like

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.840
cool and sexy, or whatever. But

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960
he went

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.040
for a walk around the area he grew up with my mum.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.280
They're from South London,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.880
and they walked around Balham.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.040
And they saw in an estate agent's window a street...

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.400
a house on the street My dad grew up, cost

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.160
more than £1 million.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.560
And I think that's when he realised,

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.400
well it can't work.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.800
Yeah. Like the...

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.480
How can social mobility exist

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.000
when the amount of money that I need to give my kids

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.120
the life that my dad gave me,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.640
his dad was a bus conductor, right,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.200
Is completely impossible

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.600
to get, no matter how hard I work.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.320
Like that's the thing

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.160
that, this is the thing when

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.760
house prices become £1 million a house, £2 million

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.120
a house,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.640
that means that social mobility

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.680
can only exist at a zoomed in level.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.760
That means that, like,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.080
no matter how hard you work,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.960
even the amount of money I made Yeah.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.400
I went to uni with kids from LSE, like,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.600
it doesn't matter what I do,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.760
I will never be as rich as them. Like, I will make,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.400
you know,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.480
very, very few people

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.320
will ever make the amount of money I made.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.280
I will never even be able

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.760
to touch these guys, regardless of what they do.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.200
Like, so, and that's

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.800
what it means when house prices are like that.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.360
Yeah.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.640
Well,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.840
you were saying, and this is something

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.160
I've sort of thought about a lot

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.120
is like the separation of,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.840
how would you word it, like

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.040
what can be true on an individual level,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.360
doesn't necessarily ring true for a big group.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.320
So like on an individual level,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.800
and this what I say,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.760
if I was to talk to a friend and be like,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.320
and they would...

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320
or like some young 18 year old lad

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.760
and he wanted life advice.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.640
I would tell him all the libertarian,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.440
go pull yourself up, go to the gym.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.760
I would tell him all that s**t.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.680
Yeah, but I would be insane

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.480
to think that

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.440
everyone in society

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.720
that that advice even works for everyone.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.920
On an individual level,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.800
you can probably improve your life

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.360
slightly like you’re example’s good.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120
If you had two guys from a working class background

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.360
one sitting around playing COD and smoking all day

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.120
and the other one's like working, he will get ahead.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.320
He's probably never going to buy a house,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.840
but he's probably going to get ahead

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.760
and the other guy's probably not.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.360
So on an individual level,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.400
while it is true, if you were to work harder,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.600
probably you would improve your life fractionally.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.160
It's the dumbest advice on a macro level.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.720
Yeah. I want to be like really clear.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.760
I ain’t telling nobody don't work hard.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.640
And I never said...

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640
That's where the left gets a bit lost.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.520
I ain’t never said to anybody don't work hard.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.200
And I'm not against making money like I've been poor,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.640
you know and I ain’t going to tell...

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.360
you know.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.720
Anybody out there, and I'll work f**king hard.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.360
I worked hard, I worked hard to get my job

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.320
and I worked hard in my job,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.400
and I worked hard to make money

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.400
and I'm supportive of all these things. But that...

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.240
and this is a big thing,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.520
which I think about a lot nowadays is like,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.720
I also understand that

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.520
class interests exist. Yeah.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.840
And we live in a world where very rapidly

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.680
the middle class is losing to the super rich and

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.800
on an individual basis, these rich guys will win.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.320
They will win.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.360
Like you cannot compete

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.480
with these guys, they’re to rich, they’ll win.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.840
And over time, that wealth will pass out of your class

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.920
and into their class.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.200
And because you can't win on the battle of money,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.880
you have to play the game of politics.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.880
You just f**king have to.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.840
You have to play the game of politics.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.120
If you don't play that game, you’re going to lose.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.120
But how do we communicate to people

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.800
that you basically, you have to do both.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.560
In the sense that you have to work hard

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.960
and you have to save your money.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.200
You have to try and invest,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.160
you have to do all these things.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.960
But if you don't play that political game

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.760
on the same team

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.600
as that guy that lives next door to you

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.720
as the same team as the guy in your football team,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.600
as the same team

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.200
as, like the people you go to school with

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.760
is the same team as it, you know? That's why...

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.960
If you don't play that political game,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.680
you basically you have to do both.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.600
I think that is where the right does really well

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.480
with the young male demographic is because it offers

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.040
an empowering message, albeit stupid,

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.360
like to tell young people they can somehow, you know,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.360
become a billionaire. It's like it's outrageous.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.840
But to a young person who has no life experience

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.040
and no understanding of like complicated systems,

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.880
power structures and how they affect you,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.840
that optimistic message will always sell to a good,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.000
especially young men

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.280
who are being told they need to go and provide

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.120
need to become powerful and strong,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.280
and we idolise that.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.160
That's always going to win against this nihilistic

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:16.760
realism.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.000
But this nihilism, this pessimistic, sad attitude

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.680
that I guess is what the left,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.000
because we are more realistic

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.040
and we understand, like the average person

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.080
doesn't really have a f**king chance, that struggle.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.920
So I think we need to find

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.040
like a really empowering message to give to people.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.920
And I think what they...

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.480
I try and analyze, like what did they do

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.040
in like the 1920s and like

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.520
when you had the work,

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.000
like the labour movements, there

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.320
they were empowered, like they weren't p**sies.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.840
They weren't going, man, this f**king sucks.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.160
They were like,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.800
no, we're going to take down the f**king...

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.600
I mean, they were like,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.200
some of them were wild communists, but they were like,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.560
we're going to take down the bourgeois,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.200
blah, blah blah.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.680
But they were,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680
they felt like they were having

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.840
a battle against the powerful.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.120
And we can sell that message

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.080
like you can talk about how like, we will rise,

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.000
we will win and we will fight these people.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.640
And that is more optimistic.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.800
A young lad needs to get behind something.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800
A young lad doesn't want to sit there and be like,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.600
man, this sucks. We're never gonna get anywhere.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.920
We need to have like a battle and a fight.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.640
And it might be dumb, it might be really stupid,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.880
but I think that's how we have to

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.920
frame stuff is this is a big battle that we can win,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.200
but we have to unite and fight against it.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.040
And I think a lot of it is about rhetoric.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.600
Like, I'm quite a believer in rhetoric.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.800
Like, I think you need strong,

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.520
powerful ideas that motivate people.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.440
I mean, that's why sort of your channel

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.920
caught my eye in a way. The big question I want to ask.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.840
What do you think

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.160
we need to do?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.720
What do you think we need to achieve, ultimately?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.080
How do you think we need to play it,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.520
to stop things from getting worse in the long run?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.080
Because I think I struggle with

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.800
is I think we’re going to lose.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.520
Yeah. I was talking to my misses about that.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.600
I was saying, like, Gary is a pessimist.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.560
Sorry, I don't mean...

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.840
You tell me what you think.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.360
Well, I think that's like,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.760
I think I would say I land on being more optimistic.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.160
I perhaps that's always just how attitude has been.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.840
And I was thinking,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.720
you come across as a realist

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.760
and realists are pessimists because reality is

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.480
the fight is unbelievably challenging.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.520
And if you're to be a realist, like

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.360
you can make the argument.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.760
It's very unlikely.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.960
But I think

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.200
that is important to have that realism because

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.600
it does keep you grounded.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.200
But I want to make, I want to make clear.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.160
Yeah. When I say, I think we're going to lose.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160
That doesn't mean

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.360
I think we're definitely going to lose.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.240
I wouldn't do this job...

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.560
Listen, I'm a trader. I'm a betting man, right?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.280
I wouldn't do this job if I thought,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.440
if I thought we were definitely going to lose,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.240
I'd just be off making my f**king millions.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.400
I'd be in the Philippines somewhere

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400
drinking piña colada, right,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.240
I don't need to do this right.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.800
I think that we have a chance.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.560
I think that we have a chance.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.840
I think that in a sense that because I'm

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.240
so pessimistic about the economy,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.800
I think that actually creates

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.680
massive political opportunities.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.600
I think that

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.840
the level of discontent on the street is massive.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.560
I think that people don't f**king like Nigel Farage.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.720
They just don't see anyone better. That's it, yeah.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.080
I don't...

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.600
I think they honestly don't see anyone better.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.240
Look, people hate the Tories.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.040
Increasingly they hate Labour

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.800
and Nigel Farage is just like, I’m someone else. Yeah.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.880
And I think that.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.640
I think that there’s a f**king gap.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.280
That's why I would say I'm optimistic.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.520
I like to see a lot of stuff as like

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.440
a, like I play board games with my mates

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.960
quite a bit, like a lot of strategy games.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.800
And, I wasn't...

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.560
I'm not even that good.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.640
Always come second, but I like, my mate is very good.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.520
I have a very smart, mate, and I always...

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.280
at the end of the game,

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.000
I always sort of like say, how did you do it?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.600
And he's got such a strategic,

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.840
or he can think steps forward.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.680
So I have picked up a bit of it

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.040
and I like looking at things like that.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.520
So like I see right now, as a massive,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.720
what you're saying, like, a massive opportunity.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.200
Like there's two sides and it requires a lot,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.600
lots of things to go right in order for it to work.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.000
But I can see something like the fact that in Britain,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.440
if we compare like, say,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.120
everywhere is seeing this far right surge.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120
And that's obviously the fear of people who are like

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.440
quite economically left wing or whatever.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.840
The far right surge is worrying.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.880
But we see it in like European nations,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.840
we see it in American...

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.760
in America, and we see it a little bit in Britain.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.960
But I think Britain stands in a particularly different,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440
sort of set of material circumstances.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.800
That make us a little bit less likely

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.680
to really fall down that rabbit hole.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.960
And we have a bit more opportunity.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.040
And I think a lot of it,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.480
and it's like every bad thing

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.960
can be a good thing at some point.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.960
So we had 14 f**king years of austerity.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.400
And like I think when you look at Reform,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.360
and I know they're a bit clever, like

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.160
sometimes they say

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.920
some sort of economically left wing thing

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.400
or we want to get free rail,

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.000
like nationalise the rail and stuff.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.360
But fundamentally their economic beliefs are

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.080
small state, cuts,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.800
and like you look at Rupert Lowe, he talks about,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.240
we need to shrink the state

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.200
and they're sort of regurgitating that stuff.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.400
I don't think that rhetoric will play

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.440
well with British people specifically,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.640
because we've had 14 years of slashing the state.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.520
We've cut half a trillion in planned

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.040
spending across those years, and we're all aware of it.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.800
We can see the results of shrinking the state.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.880
So that rhetoric

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.680
I know they're always going to lead with immigration

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.200
because I can get people in the door.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.800
But if we really jump on, like talking

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.240
about their economic policies,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.400
it's exactly the same as what we've had.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.480
And you're basically...

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.520
Reform are just saying more cuts.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.320
Like that is fundamentally where it will be.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.120
So if we can jump on them on that stuff.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.400
Then also the second thing is that, Donald Trump, he,

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.400
he's like so tied to Reform.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.840
Like if you think the success

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.280
or lack of success of Donald Trump is also the lack

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.200
or the benefit Reform.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200
If Trump does really well,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.400
Reform will probably do well.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.240
But if Trump does really bad that's not good for Reform

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.360
because they're like in bed with them basically.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.640
So Trump has four years

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.720
an our election,

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.520
if I'm not mistaken, is just after

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.000
when he will come out of office.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.720
Yeah, it should be if it goes five years.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.080
If he doesn't do another coup. Yeah.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.880
So like we've got an opportunity

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.400
where we're going to see the Donald Trump era

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.960
and then we have our election.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.280
So that is material...

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.160
that's like quite a different,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.280
kettle of fish to other people.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.240
Like for us that's really good.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600
We've had this 14 years of austerity.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.760
We don't like big cuts.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.160
Then we're going to see what Donald Trump does,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.120
hopefully in our like from a gameplay mechanics

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.000
sort of perspective,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.120
you want Donald Trump to kind of fail like it will

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.480
it will help us.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.880
And so then after that, hopefully in those five years

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.720
we'll have enough time to push this message.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.360
And the other thing is Reform are f**king

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.680
doing really well right now.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.600
All the attention’s on them, right now.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.520
Can they keep that momentum for five years.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.360
And can we come up in that period of time.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.560
That's my... I think...

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760
not to again be the pessimist.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.720
Go on. So I think,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.240
I don't think Donald Trump

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.840
will stop American living standards from falling.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.080
So I think you're right in that

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.640
because I think he's committed

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.400
to cutting tax on the rich.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400
I don't think that's going to be good.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.120
I think living standards

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.600
will keep falling in the States.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.160
The problem we have

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.480
is that I also think Labour will fail.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.560
Yeah, that's our problem.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.240
So, and that's...

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.680
and it’s weird in a way because of course,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.480
Labour are supposed to be a centre left party.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.000
Trump and the Republicans supposed to be a centre

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.600
right party,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.600
but they will both failed because of the same reason,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.600
which is that they will not deal

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.120
with growing inequality.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.040
And I think I haven't spoken about this yet, but like,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.840
the next election will be interesting

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.400
because the right will be split

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.080
between the Conservative and Reform.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.640
Labour, I think, will almost certainly do pretty badly.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.960
So you could end up with this kind of weird

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.600
three way split.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.520
Labour will probably also lose more to the Greens.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.640
But that's to assume that Labour won't get taken over.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.600
So this is, this is That's what we need to do.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600
And this is,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.840
you know, what I wanted to ask you

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.760
then after this was like

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.400
after this sort of,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.280
you know, what do you think our chances are?

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.920
I wanted to sort of zoom in a bit more on

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.480
you and me, because you and me are you and me.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.880
And what we need to do is what is like

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.440
the best thing from our strategic position. Yeah, yeah.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.720
Which is, what is the best thing for like us to do.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.560
Because my plan... I think

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.560
there's going to be an opening.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.120
I was going to say,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.320
I think there's going to be an opening on Labour.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.720
But to be honest, I kind of think, f**k Labour.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.760
Not in that sense.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.960
I don't want to be like, I hate Labour.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.200
But what I mean is,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.840
I think our only chance is to get the idea,

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.720
that inequality is the cause of living standards,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.960
bang at the front of the conversation.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.640
And it doesn't...

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.360
because you look at Rupert Murdoch, right?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.520
He doesn't f**king lobby the Conservative Party.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.800
He f**king tells the people what to think.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.080
And then the Conservative Party

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.400
have to do what he says,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.120
because if he controls what the people believe,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.480
then that pushes it it doesn't matter. Yeah.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.880
And you know, don't get me wrong.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.600
You know, I would love to have Labour

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.920
coming to me and saying, you know, come.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.760
But the truth is,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.080
even if Labour were behind

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.800
me, if the public didn't believe

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.440
that you need to deal with inequality,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.320
Labour couldn't do s**t anyway.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.040
So I think that, okay, look at our YouTube

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.920
channels are whatever, medium sized or whatever.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.000
But like we have a public voice

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.240
and we can to some degree influence

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.280
what the public think.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.160
And an engaged voice like our audience,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.320
I think they feel...

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.200
and that's what I like reading in the comments.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.760
And I see it in yours as well. It doesn't sound like...

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.400
people are kind of like on our side

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.640
and they're like champion, championing us.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.320
And that's like a good sign for like some kind of,

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.360
like movement or something

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.080
is that you've got people

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.040
that, you're giving them faith, like,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.480
you're giving them something,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.080
someone that can help fight for them.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.640
And that's like a good thing.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.800
I think what you're saying is right, personally, like,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.840
I would happily see

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.200
just a pressure group, could be a party,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.160
like, only like Ukip were very good

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.440
at pressuring the Tories, and I'm not opposed to that.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.320
My hope would be that you make a pressure group

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.040
that forces Labour in a direction.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:07.640
And what you're saying,

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.520
if you can force the public attitude.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.960
Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.800
Like push the public.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.200
At the end of the day,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.960
if I'm right on this, and I think I am right.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.800
The public are f**ked

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.560
if you don't deal with inequality. Yeah, yeah.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.560
And if the public know that,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.160
if they really know that,

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.800
then it doesn't f**cking matter what Labour do

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
and it doesn't matter what the Conservative do,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.840
it doesn't matter what Farage does,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.880
because

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.000
the public can say,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.280
we are not going to vote for f**king

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.800
anyone who doesn't deliver on this issue.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.160
And I think that that is, that is

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.240
what I would hope to achieve.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.040
And when I say that, like

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.240
this is one of the reasons why

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.400
I kind of wanted to have you on, it’s not just me,

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.920
and it's not just you, and it's not just me and you.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.160
This is a societal conversation.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.720
And if enough people get behind this idea and it's...

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.320
obviously because we have YouTube channels,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.640
we can amplify our voices.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.560
But everyone has a f**king voice.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.040
So everyone, everyone goes out like, this is not just

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.800
this is not something

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.480
that will be decided on YouTube, right?

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.080
Like people are going to watch this

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.240
and then they're going to go,

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.400
they're going to go to the pub with their mates, right?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.160
And they're going to talk about it

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:13.920
to their mates, right.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.520
And they're going to go to f**king church,

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.760
and they're going to go to f**king mosque,

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.920
and they going to go to f**king football,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.320
and they're going to go to a f**king hair salon,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.520
you know what I mean, like. Ultimately,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.120
what I want people to do,

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.000
what I want you to do, obviously you're your own man.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.720
What I want the people watching to do

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.960
is the same thing I'm doing,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.840
which is f**king convince people.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.160
Yeah. That's such a good point.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.400
Yeah.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.960
Like, if you can just make if, like,

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.280
if all job is to try and get the

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.120
yappy political guy in your group

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.400
to start seeing what we're seeing,

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.120
if we can get him on board, he...

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.800
and this could be anyone who's literally watching,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.160
you might not have a YouTube channel or something,

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.800
but it could just be some bro

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.200
who loves his politics

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.440
and that,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.760
and he's the guy who will chat about that

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.720
amongst his group,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.040
and he will softly influence his group.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.480
And then that can on a...

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.960
if that happens on a large scale,

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.360
that massively changes.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.520
The one thing I want to say on this

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.480
when you mention that is just like,

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.520
don't be pricks to your mates,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.120
because I know, like,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.760
you can p*ss people off if you're too aggressive.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.000
Like, and I know that I don't...

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.280
I try not to talk, and I hope I haven't done it to you,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.920
I try not to talk disrespectfully about people

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.880
who vote for Reform, and people who like

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.240
people who like Donald Trump, people

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.120
who like Nigel Farage, like, I don't, I don't...

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.000
I think these guys are misdirecting you.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.440
We need to be like,

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.720
you don't win arguments by telling people around you

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.400
that they're fucking pricks. That's exactly right.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.520
Like 100%

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.680
like we need to be bringing people in here, man.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.440
We need to be like, supportive, and like,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.960
people are scared, man. People are scared.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.360
People are hating immigrants, right?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.040
Because I watched Sky news the other day

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.400
and it said there housing crisis, immigrants. God damn.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.280
As simple as that, right. And people are...

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.480
people think,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.920
because people are being told

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.640
that they can't get house because of the immigrants.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:52.960
Yeah.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.240
So like you can't turn around

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.400
and be like anyone who wants

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.560
low immigration is a racist.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.600
Anyone who wants low immigration is a prick, like.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.040
We need to convince them.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.880
Look, it's the growing inequality.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.880
We need to make that case. And it's not about like,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.200
p*ssing people off and pushing people away, like.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.240
Like people are scared, man.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.440
Yeah, I agree,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.560
that's like one of those ones

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.720
where you're saying like, well,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.680
I was thinking earlier, you know,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.960
I said about the meritocracy,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.640
there's a few certain, like, sticking points

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.440
that I think people need more information

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.280
on, simplified

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280
because at some point people

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.200
didn't believe in meritocracy.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.280
At some point people didn't believe

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.640
immigrants were the cause of all problems.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.240
But they heard a few little things,

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.520
and they built up that story,

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.360
that like belief in their head.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.200
And I think like the immigration one is one

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.040
I try and attack at the moment.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.640
I've done a few videos, but it's like this zero sum...

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.000
people have a massive gap of information

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.120
with immigration.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.160
That was a bar.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.640
Information, gap of information about immigration,

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.440
because we see it's such a zero sum

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.040
way about when it comes to economics.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.240
And, this is like this thing that I realised as I got

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.120
older is like, little information on a topic

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.240
is worse than no information.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.840
It's like a classic thing people say.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.520
And like immigration is a really good one

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.040
because you could say something like, you witness,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.240
I don't know, you worked in this industry.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.040
Say it was like,

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.480
I don’t know, you worked at a shop,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.120
you're just stacking shelves or something,

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.000
and you noticed that there's now,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.920
like an Asian guy doing that job.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.800
In your head from an individual level,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.640
if you don't understand macroeconomics,

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.080
you have seen that guy took your job,

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.840
and that's how you see it. But

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.840
the understanding around immigration,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.160
how it affects economies is one of these areas,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.240
because we're so poorly informed about it,

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.880
you’ll look at it from a surface level

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.400
and not have a deeper understanding.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.200
It'd be like looking at the Earth

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.680
in front of you and going, the world is flat.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680
But we know it's not flat

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.640
because when we were in school, we were taught about

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.560
like how the f**king solar system works and all that.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.000
But because we see things

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.600
and we have such a gap of information,

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.280
you don't understand, like if an immigrant comes in

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.000
and he takes your job, blah, blah, blah, whatever,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.880
you see that as a net negative to your life.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.040
But that immigrant who's come

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.280
in, he's bought in, let's say

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.480
he needs his haircut once every week,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.680
or he needs to go get his car repaired

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.960
and he needs to go buy food.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.400
He goes to the local restaurant.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.840
That immigrant has bought trade

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.200
to thousands of businesses.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.840
So like the way we understand economy,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.400
on like an individual level,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.040
when we see this

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.840
guy's taking a job,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.000
we're not seeing the wider

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.720
invisible effect that he is bringing

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.240
benefits the economy.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.400
So like this is one of those things

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.760
where if there's a lack of information,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.160
then people will just use their sort of like,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.320
firsthand

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.080
interpretation of what immigration

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.800
looks like in their life or whatever,

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.040
and not expand it out to wider economics.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.360
Like that immigrant is a benefit

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.600
because he's bought a load of trade,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.800
or he’s a new customer to this business.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.280
If you fit carpets or whatever

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.920
he will one day need his carpet fit.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.680
He will employ you. Like do you see what I'm saying.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.120
And this is one of the topics like the meritocracy,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.760
where that lack of information,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.400
that lack of understanding

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.480
allows people

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.240
to just say like, yeah, they're taking your jobs,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.200
they're doing this.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:53.640
They're like,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.880
you know, stealing the houses

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.480
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, man, I just

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.160
I worry about

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.600
the like corrosive effect it has on like,

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.160
this community's basically like this.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.880
Because I know that,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.040
you know, people who want low immigration,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.080
they're not racists.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.880
Some of them there are some racists,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.240
but a lot of people are just told

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.960
that this is the economic problem, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.120
That's why they always say I'm not a racist, but,

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.400
and that's why I've got an Asian mate.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.320
Because they're not fundamentally hatred,

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.240
they don't have a hatred of their skin colour

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.640
or their skin colour, whatever.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.440
They're being told

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.640
that they're the root of the problem on a macro level.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.800
Yeah. I just see like it's f**king divisive.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.560
It is.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.680
It's f**king divisive. And,

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.240
you know, I come from East London, you know,

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.160
and it's like

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.400
very, very, very multicultural place, right

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.400
and that's not like unique

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.720
by any stretch of the imagination.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.640
Like especially when we talk about poorer

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.560
people in this country

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.640
especially when we talk about the cities.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.120
Especially when we talk about younger people.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.080
It's a f**king multicultural country now, right.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.160
And I worry

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.280
that all of this narrative,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.760
all of this like discussion about it,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.240
is driving people against each other

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.080
and making people distrust each other.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.200
And for me, like the message

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.520
I'm trying to push, the message

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.800
I'm trying to sell is like

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.800
that group over there, they're gonna take your stuff

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.360
and on an individual basis

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.680
they're much stronger than you,

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.840
and the only way you can defend

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.440
yourself is working together. Yeah.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.320
And

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.600
if you know the working classes, which is, you know,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.520
the working class is racially diverse

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.320
and the working class in this country

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.080
is racially diverse. And,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.640
listen talking about the levels of migration

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.160
you want is one thing, and like, I'm open to that.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.160
But like if this starts to spill into just like

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.720
distrust between

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.960
people of different races,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.240
we're f**ked.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.920
Are you saying like you think

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.720
instead of trying to dispel

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.640
every myth around immigration

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.600
or every argument

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.720
or whatever, even, you know,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.160
if they have some good arguments or whatever,

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.400
instead of going down that route

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.760
of trying to debunk and disprove and stuff,

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.680
you would say it's better to

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.960
just put the attention on the real like problem,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.080
which is obviously inequality.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.000
So like,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.640
are you saying from a strategical point of view,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.600
you don't know how valuable it is to like

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.880
go into the ins and outs of why these people are wrong,

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.600
but rather try and show why you're right.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.960
This is something I thought about quite a lot.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.760
There's a degree to which it's intentional

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.120
that I haven't engaged that much

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.200
with the debate on immigration,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.640
because I think it's f**king divisive. And,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.800
I grew up in a very multicultural area, you know, and,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.480
I went to...

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.040
the schools I went to, literally,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.200
I went to schools that were like 5% white.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:49.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.080
My school was at least 50%, 60% black,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.000
mainly Nigerians.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.400
So I was just completely normal with it.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.600
I was like, I didn't think about it.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.880
I just feel like if...

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.080
I would like to find a way to...

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.840
Obviously you’re affected in some way

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.520
by being like a small ethnic minority

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.880
in a place that you grew up but you,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.440
you form friendships.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.080
Of course, you form friendships

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.680
with people from different ethnicities, right. And,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.680
we need to be able to see each other as f**king people,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.480
you know what I mean?

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.040
And, like, not just the differences.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.680
So I always, always think that I'm always like,

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.520
yeah, no matter how much you think you're different

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.440
to, say, a guy who,

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.720
even, like, say, someone who's come in as a refugee.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.280
How different,

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.520
how different you might think

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.320
your lives are realistically

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.440
the things that happen on a political scale,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.000
those decisions

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.760
the same decision

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.480
if they raise a tax on,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.440
you know, working class people, or if they,

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.960
I don't know, if they cut, more

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.360
so, if they cut a certain public service,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.080
if they underfund the NHS,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.640
both you and the refugee

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.960
are very negatively affected

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.640
by that exact same decision,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.120
whereas the very wealthy person,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.240
they have private healthcare.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.240
So like your lives are affected by the same decisions

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.400
in very similar ways.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.880
If house prices go up, that affects you.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.360
And the guy who goes to the mosque

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.000
like your lives are both very negatively affected.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
The billionaire or the millionaire, even

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.160
they make money off of that.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.480
So it's like you got to start seeing

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.840
that the same things are affecting

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.680
the people we think we have a lot of differences with.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.760
Our lives are so similar, I'm sure. Let's talk about

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.120
how much do you think

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.240
we could achieve on YouTube,

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.800
and what do you think is the best way

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.720
to be effective?

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.760
Yeah, I think

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.320
so my channels are projected like 2 to 3 years

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.440
I’ll probably have like a million subs

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.520
which is like big.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.160
That's really big.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.560
And I mean like videos, it

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.160
depends, but it means on average

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.040
they'll probably hit like half a million views

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.640
and some like a million more often.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.560
And that's massive. And if my channel probably is...

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.720
I think your trajectory is probably steeper.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.680
So yours would probably be

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.640
in a similar category

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.400
and bearing in mind

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.040
that would put us three years out from the election,

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.520
so we'd be in a bigger position at a time

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.440
where we're still like, we're coming close to election.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.920
So that's like quite good.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.920
And I think if we can make this ecosystem

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.280
like it's great

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.240
that we're doing this because it's

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.960
like if we can make an ecosystem

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.080
of very similar creators and we talk to each other

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.320
and we make cool, interesting, fun, engaging content

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.640
that's relatable for just like average people. Yeah.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.600
I think,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.200
I don't know, I see it as a very powerful thing.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.520
Like, you got to think like Joe Rogan and all them lot,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.920
they all came from, like it was small in the beginning.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.600
Yeah. But it was well connected.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.080
And there were interesting people

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.160
from different backgrounds

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.080
and like, people love their culture.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.560
They loved the thing that it was like,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.400
you felt like you listened to Joe Rogan,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.640
you go to the gym,

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.320
you're probably into

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.280
maybe you got a little side hustle or something,

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.200
and you felt like you're part of a thing.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.440
And I think if we can create

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440
something like that,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.920
especially like, you know, we

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.640
we talk a lot about young lads,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.520
but I think, like on in my sort of channel and stuff,

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.320
but I think like

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.760
if we can give something for young lads

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.800
I think would be great because if we can connect them

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.600
then it will, yeah, it will just galvanize people.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.400
So I think we have a good timeline of doing this.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:04.960
This idea

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.880
about like an ecosystem of different creators.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.920
One of the reasons I wanted to have you on

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.240
is because I don't actually watch a lot of YouTube.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.080
I know you don't.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.520
I don't watch a lot of social media.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.720
Yeah, except for my ASMR, don’t

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.360
out me for watching ASMR.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.360
So I don't watch a lot of social media.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.080
I know you all are a lot more clued in.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.880
So maybe you can talk a little bit about

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.160
other creators that you think are doing good work.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.760
That people watching might want to go check out.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.840
And also about like,

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.720
whether you are doing work yourself to try to sort of

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.800
build a bit of community

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.880
that is trying to do something

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.960
a little bit more political.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.840
So I've started a discord

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.360
like maybe a year ago,

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.320
and that’s doing like pretty well.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.920
I think we’ve got like 2000 people and it's fairly new,

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.880
but they're super active and they’re always chatting.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.080
So like,

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:56.600
I've been,

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600
I understand

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.640
the need to do the connecting the people and that,

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.240
so I'm trying to get more into streaming

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.200
because that's like the perfect

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200
platform for doing that.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.640
So I've been working on like,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.040
it's tough getting the time to stream,

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.120
but the goal is anyway to stream

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.320
a lot more and do collabs of different people.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.640
And like a list of creators, I would say,

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.600
who are like killing it.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.040
That are sick, that I could see coming together

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.040
as a people like Ordinary Things, he's sick.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.120
We don't agree on everything.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120
But on the general problems

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.280
about like inequality and stuff.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.840
We're like pretty clued in, on that.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.480
And he makes great videos. They're very funny.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.720
He's just a Britishy lad, like,

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.760
you know, so Ordinary Things.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.840
And he's got a big audience. A million, whatever.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.920
Just Some Geezer.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.680
He's a younger, newer creator,

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.920
but he's been making these, like, pieces

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.920
on, like, right wing people.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.400
So he did one on, like, Tommy Robinson,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.560
and he did one on, like, Piers Morgan.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.520
And they're really good. He's quite funny as well.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.720
So I want to, like, connect that with him.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.160
Who else?

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.240
There's a geezer by the name of Tom,

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.760
is it Tom Nicholson? Tom Nicholson?

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.200
Yeah, he's much, I’d say he's a smart bru.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.360
He's like a brains.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.000
He makes incredibly good videos and he’s

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.960
yeah, he's funny and he's very switched on stuff.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.240
And his academic side is good

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.480
because it makes you like,

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.400
learn stuff that maybe you gloss over. Whatever.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.240
Who else?

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.280
A Different Bias. He's a guy who makes daily...

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.200
He's great, right.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.120
So we’ve got all these big video essay channels

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.240
where we talk about very nebulous

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.760
big topics,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.720
but, A Different Bias,

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.680
he makes, like daily

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.520
political commentary on British stuff.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.600
And he's very good.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.360
He's funny.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.360
They're off the cuff and they're like, good.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.240
So there’s people do this stuff.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.600
There’s people doing stuff, and they're funny.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.960
The charismatic people like, they think...

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.920
I often think like, it's going to need that.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.200
It's going to need lots of different people

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.400
doing lots of different things. And like.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.120
And I think streaming and podcasts,

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.560
like connecting these people

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.880
because that, that's like where everything's at.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.560
And I would like to say like, people watching,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.960
If you're interested in creating,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.800
like we need more people doing it,

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.480
we need more people do.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.960
And people message me sometimes, you know,

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.200
should I go into, should I study economics?

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.040
I'm quite anti it.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.760
But we need people studying economics.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.360
We need people buying into political parties.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.720
We need people going to the media.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.200
We need people doing like creative stuff.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.720
We need people creating art.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.680
Yes. Like musicians bruv.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.560
Yeah, whatever. Like wherever you are. Like

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.200
if you're thinking about getting involved.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.920
Yeah. Get involved. And in your own way.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.120
What you’re saying is right about music,

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:23.960
music is massive.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.240
Like I want to start making more music.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.760
You need to start making music.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.920
Get Gary on the mic.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.120
But yeah, like musicians and stuff.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.720
Because if you go back and listen to that

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.240
old Akala, Fire in the Booth.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.280
You listen to it.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.520
The man just f**king explained inequality in a song.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.160
But I want to encourage people like, Akala is great,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.240
but you don't need to be Akala.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.760
No. What I'm saying is,

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.400
we can all be influential in the sphere that we’re in.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.520
We can all be like

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.000
you know, it might be like,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.520
you might just reach wherever your school

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.680
we have people here who are still in school.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.560
You might just reach people in your workplace like.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.920
Make something like, do something.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.440
Reach people around you. That's what I would say.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.680
And I think, yeah, like,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.160
I know I keep banging on about that types of people.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.840
And I know it's sort of dumb and on a personal level

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.760
don't really care.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.800
But like if you're someone, if you're like a geezers

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.200
is f**king

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.880
absolutely TRT’d out

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.040
and you're massive

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.040
and who in our areas

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.520
looks like that is making that content,

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.000
and can speak to people that are similar like that.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:21.760
Same for like if you’re

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.800
like a f**king lad from the ends,

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.040
like if you started doing content

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.000
or just doing something and talking about these topics

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.160
you're going to speak to so many people

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.000
that the really academic lot who are great,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.960
they're never going to reach

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.840
and they're never going to appeal to you.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.720
Yeah that's what we...

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.440
you need like,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.800
the more diversity of voices,

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800
the more diversity of voices.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.800
And it can work in weird ways, it can work.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.440
Like I remember when I was a kid,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.600
when grime popped off

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.040
and it was like it was Dizzee Rascal and it was Kano

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.880
and it was Wiley.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.320
And like for me, those guys were me.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.200
Like, I was like, these guys are me like,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.760
so you never really know, like.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.440
Yeah and it's like when, so like...

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.560
I would like to add to a point like, you know,

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.800
we need women doing this as well.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.600
Like, I know, like I see the dem’s,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.800
I see the demographics on my channel.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.880
I know it's mainly men watching,

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.560
like everybody is welcome here.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.280
And we need people,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.280
we need people of all different demographics.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.480
And the ladies they’re a bit more ahead of us, man.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.760
They're more left wing,

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.200
so they're doing a good job already.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.760
So like we're trying like but yeah,

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.680
keep doing what you're doing.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.480
The ladies are smashing it.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.120
We need to pick up the the slack our end I think.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.240
But, yeah. I might need to try...

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.480
Women are killing it. I’ll try to get people more...

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.520
as many people on as we can.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.480
But anyway, I want to get to my next question.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.280
I know you've been following this channel for a bit.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.840
Is there anything that we've been talking about that

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.360
you think it's not clear

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.280
that you would like understanding better?

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.440
Is there anything we haven't covered

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.360
that you would like us to cover?

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.600
Yeah.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.360
The one that does jump to my mind is

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.200
if the wealthy own assets.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.400
I understand the housing.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.160
I can see, I can definitely understand

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:48.840
the argument

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.920
why housing, owning housing is very negative,

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.840
net negative generally for people.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.440
If they own stocks in companies

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.560
would the right wing argument not be correct,

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.480
that that would bring more money

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.120
to invest into the company to bring more jobs.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.360
And is that a fair argument?

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.240
There being more wealth is not a bad thing.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.080
You know, if they’re creative,

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.280
if wealth is being creative, that's a good thing.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.600
The problem is, is transfer. It's transfer.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.640
So like if those stocks used to be owned by

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.840
ordinary people

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.800
and then one generation down,

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.400
then the other ordinary people don't have them.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.320
This is a problem.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.120
It's a problem because you need to that's

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.760
that's what your pension is basically.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.520
You’re owning pensions.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.200
So like if these guys are owning the stocks

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.840
and you're not owning the stocks,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.840
well then how are you going to pay for your retirement?

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.800
You see what I'm saying. So

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.880
So is there like statistics to say that like

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.440
at some point

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.720
working class or middle class

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.560
families owned more stocks

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.000
and now more stocks are landing

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.240
in the hands of billionaires?

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.880
Is that probably something to say there?

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.800
Well, I mean, a lot of young people are just

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.120
are not I’ve never even thought about it.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.080
Like pensions, you know,

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.440
I mean, like pension contributions,

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.360
like it's it's becoming

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.240
way more difficult for young people to own pensions.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:54.760
These guys think.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.680
But the truth is like

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.320
so that kind of private asset in this country,

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.680
the working class has never had like a massive share

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.400
of those.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.880
You've kind of clicked something in my head, I get it.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.320
Yeah. Yeah.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.760
Like in a country like Germany or the US

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.320
where there's more of a culture

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.120
of owning stocks and shares for the working class,

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.520
they will see more like they’re

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.480
losing stocks and shares.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.040
In this country, the truth is, like

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.040
the middle class never owned

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.280
a huge amount, but like our generation versus

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.280
our parents generation.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.920
But they were saving pensions more than we were.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.560
What you're saying.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.240
I never put those two together,

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.080
that it's pensions that are stocks and shares.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:28.720
I never put that together.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.600
And I know for a fact that my generation...

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.080
Nowadays young people,

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.400
just increasingly just don't own stock and shares.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.080
That's what I was going to say.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.320
Like I don't know,

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.480
I know very few people that have an actual pension.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.400
And my dad is always like, when we was your age,

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.080
we starting building up our pensions. Yeah.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.320
But there's knock on effects, right?

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:42.960
Which is like.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.440
Okay, you don't have stocks and shares,

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.280
you don’t have a pension.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.920
Well, that means like, you can't

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.200
you can't save much money, you know,

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.880
and you can't

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.320
you're going to drop your spending, right.

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.080
Because you know, like,

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.320
oh my God, like I don't have a pension.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.520
You know, I mean, I can't afford this.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.240
And then...

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.680
it means

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.280
and then also the rich just on the other side,

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.560
this is side that doesn't get spoken about.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.320
The rich owning a shit ton is itself a problem.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.760
Because if the rich owned a s**t

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.040
ton of stocks and shares

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.960
as opposed to ordinary families,

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.880
they generate s**t on of passive income.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.440
What are they going to do with that passive income?

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.880
Buy the rest of the f**king assets.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.480
And that is why you're f**king...

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.040
you can't afford a house, right?

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.480
Like if you give these guys loads of money,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.400
the big thing that you see,

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.080
if the rich and people think about this,

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.320
if the richer a f**k ton of stocks and shares,

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.800
of course you can't afford a house.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.440
Like if that guy's making

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.280
£100,000 a year passive income.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.280
Yeah, You know.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.240
You can't compete on that.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.640
Yeah, this is the problem.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.840
They drive the house prices up.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.920
And it's not that,

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.680
I'm not anti wealth, I'm not anti wealth.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.760
But the truth is like the economy is not zero sum.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.000
But if it's growing very slowly like it is

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.640
it's kind of zero sum. Yeah.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.800
And if these guys are getting more

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.920
and more and more and more and more,

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.840
they start to buy the things that you need, you know,

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.680
why do you think it is

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.640
that, you know, rents go up in London.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.080
Somebody is f**king paying them.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.880
It's the f**king rich people that are paying the rents,

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.560
you know what I mean, and that's what they drive

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.720
the price of everything that you need.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.800
Yeah that clicks that.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.440
The pensions thing

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.400
that made that more,

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.840
yeah, that's a good way of explaining that

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.000
because I didn't I never even thought I was like,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.680
when did we have stocks and shares?

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.240
But then I realise

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.160
obviously pensions are stocks and shares.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.920
Yeah you're right. It's not it's a good point.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.360
People don't realise that. Yeah. Yeah.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:11.920
Well that's

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.360
how ordinary people hold their stocks

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.920
and shares, in pensions.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.800
It was kind of like, I've noticed that

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.920
I don’t know, is their theory about this.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.080
But it's like

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.520
I noticed the difference,

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.920
so my wife's Ukrainian, which I bang on about,

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.400
and they became capitalists in the 90s. Okay.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.160
And they're,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:30.520
they didn't,

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.560
to give you perspective,

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.800
They didn't have restaurants until like the 2000s,

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.480
you'd go to like a canteen,

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.240
and it wasn't going to be like state of the art.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.360
You just grab it and f**king bang it on a plate.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.080
In the 2000s, you see, like this insane rise.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:47.080
Well, really, it's sort of late 2000s into 2010s. Yeah.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.240
You see a rise in

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.280
what you could probably call

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.720
like early stage capitalism, where there's like a real,

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.120
what people think capitalism is, which is go work hard,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.960
have a good idea and life will rewards you.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.240
That kind of exists in this sort of Wild West

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.360
early stages of the Ukrainian economy.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.120
And so a specific thing I noticed, it's very specific,

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.040
I don't know if it's too granular

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.400
to make any grand points about,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.640
but is

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.360
I notice that if you go to Ukraine,

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.760
if you go to a cafe, you walk into that cafe,

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.640
it will look perfect.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.840
It will be incredible.

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.000
Every cafe, not just like one of them,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.400
every one of them.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.160
And you walk in, you go to the toilets.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.160
The toilets are immaculate. They cleaned, they are...

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.160
I know this is very random, we’ll come back to it.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.960
Learning a bit about Ukraine. Yeah.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.800
You’ll go in, toilets are perfect.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.960
Smells nice. They have high quality soaps.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.760
You come back

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.960
after you've taken your dump and you eat your food.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.120
Food's amazing, obviously.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:40.720
You wipe...

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720
I'm not just advertising Ukraine,

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.520
there is a point here, you want your mouth.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.960
You put your tissue down,

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.880
the staff comes, they take the tissue.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.920
Everything's perfect, right.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.400
You come to England,

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.480
you go to the toilets of most cafes.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.120
They stink of s**t. There's toilet paper everywhere.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.240
And if you go to like.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:57.760
You know,

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.600
you wait, you want someone to f**king serve you,

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.240
you need to scan an app. The QR code doesn't work.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.240
They take ages to get to you.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.240
And I wanted to know, is there like this theory

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.600
that when an economy is growing, they're competing?

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.520
The belief in capitalism

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.440
is that there's competition drives innovation.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.160
In the early stages of creating an industry

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.280
does that competition create innovation?

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.560
But when they've achieved their customers,

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.320
they've got a customer base,

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.160
I believe there's a crossover point

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.840
where they stop innovating to compete for customers

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.880
because they've got their market

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.960
and they start looking for shortcuts to make money,

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.600
which could be employ less people.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.200
It could be lower the quality of the meat in the food.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.160
Video games I noticed had a very similar trajectory.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.360
They were sick in the 2000s.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.920
Now it's all about loot crates and,

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.400
you know, microtransactions and phone games.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.200
Is there a point when you, is there a name

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.960
or is there a concept that once you reach, you,

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.000
you've caught your audience,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.280
then you stop innovating

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.960
and you start, like profit gouging, like you try and...

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.640
does that make sense?

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.600
It's a big question.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.720
And obviously, you know,

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.960
Ukraine is not the only country

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.280
which has very high service culture.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.520
I lived in Japan for two years

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.520
and the quality of services is phenomenal.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.080
And we can sort of debate how capitalist Japan is.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.600
It's kind of a complicated question.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.480
I think,

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.960
there is a thing that can tend to happen where I think,

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.520
and I'm, you know, I'm not anti-capitalist.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.000
I'm not not pro capitalist.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.920
I try to just be pragmatic on things.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.160
Capitalism tends to work

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.600
well when you have a lot of room to expand.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.240
And this is why, you know, I talk about being

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:47.760
the dangers

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.480
of high inequality and people,

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.960
sometimes use a counter example,

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.040
like the USA, which has high inequality and,

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.360
you know, has had for quite a long

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.520
time high living standards.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.560
You know, the USA is a, is still a quite a new country.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.080
And,

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.920
you know, Europeans arrived there

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:12.920
not that long ago and they were able to expand

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120
almost freely

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.240
because they were basically able

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.720
to take most of the land over time from the natives.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.520
So it's a f**king massive country to expand into,

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.400
and it doesn't really matter

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.320
if the rich, get really f**king rich.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.360
If you have like infinite land

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.000
and natural resources over there

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.240
because like, you can get really f**king rich

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.400
and I'll just go over there. Start something new..

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.000
Yeah.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.400
So like under that, kind of this like American context

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.480
for a long time.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.960
Inequality like,

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.640
didn’t really seem that dangerous, right.

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.840
Because you can get as rich as you like.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.920
And this kind of concept,

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.560
which is like politics of envy works right,

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.440
which is like,

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.600
you know, we go over there,

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.000
you know, like for a long time,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.480
America was effectively infinitely large

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.600
from the perspective of Europeans, right,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.360
because it was so big.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.680
And you could just keep going west,

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.760
you keep going west,

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.280
and there's more land, more land, more resources.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.440
Just go. Just go. Just go.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.320
That is very different to like,

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.400
mature, advanced economy, like

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.440
Britain's or increasingly like the US now

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.000
where every square inch of land is owned.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.680
Yeah.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.520
That's I've heard something about. Yeah.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.600
You kind of connected a thought there,

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.880
because I've heard that being called like,

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.800
The New Frontier or something like that.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.920
So capitalism works by finding new frontiers,

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.520
exploiting the frontier and then moving on to the next.

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:32.680
Yeah.

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.040
If there's,

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.560
if there's, like another, if there's loads of land,

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.120
it doesn't matter if you've,

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.480
you've like settled here and you've made this yourself.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.080
There's this infinite that I can just keep going.

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.760
But as soon as you run out of land, then suddenly

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.880
people can't keep going anymore.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.320
And they need to find land and they need to find work,

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.160
they need to find resources. Yes. And then also

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.400
the rich are still expanding, right?

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.120
Because the rich are still really rich

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:55.960
and they're still expanding.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.600
And then what are they expanding into?

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.040
Well, they're not expanding is empty land anymore.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.520
They have to take from somebody else, you know.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.600
So I think capitalism tends to work

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.000
well in like young economies that are growing quickly.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.800
The problem is like

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.720
when you kind of run out of stuff to expand into

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720
and then what tends to happen

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.680
is then the rich start to take the assets of the,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.080
of the middle class and the poor, basically.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.440
One thing that I think is

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.160
really, is quite interesting is,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:21.400
you know,

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.960
I made a lot of money in my early, mid 20s

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.400
and I did like a f**k ton of investments

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.760
and some of the investments were like,

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.080
oh let’s invest in a new company.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.160
And let’s build a new thing,

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.200
let's build a new restaurant.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.440
And a lot of them were just like,

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.120
let's just buy a property. And it's just buy gold.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.440
Almost all of the let's build a new thing failed. Yeah.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.120
And almost all of the let’s buy

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.400
an existing thing worked really well, basically.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:42.760
And that’s,

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.520
That's kind of what happens, right.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.840
Because when, once you've got nothing to expand into,

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.280
well, it's much easier to just...

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.080
because the rich are much richer than the middle class.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.080
Yeah. They can just out bid you. And that is what...

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.680
this rise in house prices, rising stock prices,

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.880
that is the rich outbidding

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.320
the middle class for assets.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.240
That's why at the board games, man.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.920
Everyone should play a board game.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.800
It's very much like the end of monopoly,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.240
which is like, you know, it works fine.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.520
We’re all buying, we’re buying, we’re all buying.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.440
But then suddenly, like, these guys own everything.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.520
And, you know.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.120
It's so logical when you think about it is so logical.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.280
Yeah.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:20.480
Yeah.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.280
Well, I mean, you know,

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.000
you look at history like earlier

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.800
industrial evolution like it

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.560
it wants to expand, it wants to expand.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.480
And that's why you saw like Europeans just...

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.360
that's why colonialism happened in a sense.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.520
Like it's like we have all this s**t

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.040
expand and go and like take them.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.840
But then eventually, like in a sense, you can view

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.920
World War One and World War Two

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.480
as basically like they ran out of world to expand into.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.360
And then once you...

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.600
but because you're still growing,

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.880
you still have all this like excess production,

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.360
but you don’t have anywhere to expand into

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.680
you have no choice but to fight each other.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.120
And it's like, okay, well,

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.880
like, we've already taken over the world.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.760
You've taken over the world.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.120
There's no way to expand into.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.880
Well, but we still producing s**t, we have to,

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.920
we have to go to war, basically.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.680
There's no other option. Like it's... Yeah, yeah.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.000
But what you see, what you're seeing now

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.920
is like,

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.120
the weak hands are being shuffled out

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.400
and the weak hand is the western middle class

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.880
and the western...

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.280
To be honest,

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.240
it's not a western elite, it's a global elite

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.960
is just absolutely decimating the western middle class.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.760
So it’s the end of a poker game.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.920
Yeah, but then but then what happens

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.480
when the middle class goes. Yeah.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.840
You know, once again

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.840
they'll be in a situation where the rich....

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.520
And that's the thing about capitalism.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520
The rich will go at each other.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.400
I mean, I mean, that's you know, that's

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.480
what f**king Putin is, right?

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.200
That is the rich going at each other.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.120
And it's funny that these lot they,

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.080
they have the access,

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.800
they have the best access to information.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.320
And they should see the writing on the wall

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.400
like it would be insane for billionaires. Don't

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.760
please don't assume they're intelligent.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.880
No, yeah, I don't believe that. Like these guys.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.920
I think the best way to...

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.240
I heard it described as like a Mongol horde.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:52.600
Yeah.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.320
Like these guys have money, they have power,

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.600
they have resources, they want money,

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.760
they want power, they want resources.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.160
They're not, you know...

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.640
It's like it sounds cartoonish to say it,

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.600
but they are so over driven

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.840
by greed, their greed will consume them and kill them.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.880
Like capitalism will...

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.280
But to be honest, it's more than the greed.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.760
They're just so f**king rich. There's...

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.840
it's easy for them.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.480
Like they can outbid you on everything.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.560
They can out bid you on f**king everything.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.960
Like it's not it’s,

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.680
like you know Rishi Sunak £700 million.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.040
What's the passive income on £700 million. Right.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.360
5% a year.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.400
He's going to be making £35 million

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.440
a year, a half million pounds a week, right.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.000
Conservative.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.480
Yeah.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.000
It's not difficult to outbid

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.280
everyone when you're making half a million

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.720
pounds a week passive income.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.080
In fact these guys won't even do it themselves,

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.480
they'll have a family office

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.240
that all they do is they just buys s**t, buys s**t,

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.280
buys s**t, buys s**t, buys s**t,

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.360
buys s**t, buys s**t, buys s**t.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.560
And your kid is out there

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.760
working a job for 50 grand a year.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.200
He's competing with Rishi Sunak’s kids,

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.360
who make half a million pounds a week passive income.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.480
And he's watching Andrew Tate.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.760
Thinking that he can f**king be with him one day.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.400
That’s mad. Yeah.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.720
Just to like make it very simple, right?

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.280
Power f**king matters.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.960
If you allow that group to get really,

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.000
really, really f**king powerful.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.080
Whilst your group is losing power.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.920
Eventually they'll take everything.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.680
And that is why the vast majority of human

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.480
history is a tiny group of super rich elites

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.320
and a massive group of impoverished peasants.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.440
Yeah, I don't know how people can like,

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.200
hey should just understand inherently through...

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.240
if you've even read any story in history,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.880
that's always been the case.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.000
But it's always been.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.080
It’s been a long time now, you know?

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.760
But, you know, I read,

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.440
I read a lot of classic books

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.760
as I'm encouraging you to do.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.960
Go and read Dickens

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960
it’s only 150 years ago we had that here.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.680
That’s the craziest...

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.880
the reading about that period of time

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.000
that led to World War Two

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.680
and then seeing the similarity.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.760
At the time of Dickens,

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.240
the UK was easily

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.960
the richest, most powerful country in the world,

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.840
and your average British person lived in absolute,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.280
desperate poverty. Yeah.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.000
And to believe that

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.440
that would somehow pan out differently is just.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.240
Yeah, it just ignores history.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.760
Every story of history.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.360
But, you know, the rich, they've got their own stories

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.320
and they've got their own stories,

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.720
and their stories are if you work hard, you’ll make it.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.560
Their stories are the reason

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.920
you’re poor is because of immigrants.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.880
The reason you’re poor is because of foreigners.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.520
Their stories are just go buy Bitcoin

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.720
and you'll be a billionaire, you know.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.480
You know they have their stories too,

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.840
they have their stories too. But

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.160
what they want is your stuff.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.400
And if you believe their stories, then they'll get it.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.640
But that's the power of story.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.760
And that is, that is why I do this YouTube channel.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.400
And, that is presumably why you try

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.440
and do stories as well.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.840
And that's why I like my stuff is like, it's not

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.840
I don't put just academic papers. It's I tell a story.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.360
It's like I'm making stories

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360
that you can relate and feel.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.440
There's music,

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.840
there's like emotions

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.520
because stories are the most important thing.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.520
And your story could be based on a lie or truth.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.960
And so I'm trying to put the truth into a story

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.600
that makes people feel something

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.600
that hopefully makes them think differently I suppose.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.440
Well, good luck with it. Yeah, and you bruv.
