00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Okay.

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.720
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.000
Today, we are going to do the second video

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.520
in our course on inequality and the economy.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.720
This one is called What is Wealth inequality?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.880
And if we get time we'll go on

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.440
to how it affects the economy.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.760
This is really the heart of my economic understanding.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.480
It's what I make my money on.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.320
And it's really important for all of our videos,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
so I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.200
All right.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.760
So second video, first video was What is Wealth.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.920
And that was just explaining

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440
that we're not talking about jobs.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.920
We're not talking about income.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.200
Wealth is about assets, physical assets.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.280
Who owns the assets.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.080
So in this country it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.080
largely property, not just housing,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.920
but also commercial property,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.520
offices, shops, restaurants, bars,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.960
factories, natural resources, like the farmland,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960
the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.760
power plants.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.760
So the generation of essentials like, food and energy.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.440
Who owns those things and also debt.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.240
So some people owe debt to other people.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.880
That is wealth.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.480
Not about jobs is about who owns the wealth.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.320
And this video is going to be about

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.360
what is wealth inequality.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.240
So when we talk about wealth inequality,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.960
it's about who owns those things.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.200
I think the best way to explain

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.880
this is through imagining

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.840
two separate kinds of economies.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.280
One which is relatively wealth equal.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.720
So all of that wealth is quite evenly distributed

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.040
throughout society.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800
And one which is very unequal.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200
So where all of that wealth is owned by,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.080
you know, a small handful of families.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.040
So in the wealth equal economy,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.160
basically everyone's going to own like a big chunk of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.040
the house they live in.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.800
Everyone will pretty much own the house they live in,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.160
but they're also going to own

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.760
a lot of the productive capacity in society.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.440
So the way we see

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.600
that nowadays is basically

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.520
everybody has like a big stock portfolio.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.120
So everybody owns their own house

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120
or a chunk of their house.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.640
And they also have like a stock portfolio,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.400
which means they own some of the corporations.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.320
Through those stocks they're going to own,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.760
you know, some of the commercial property,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.200
some of the buildings, some of the skyscrapers.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.040
They'll also own a chunk of the natural resources.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.440
So, they’s own a little bit of the farmland.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.280
They’ll own some of the power production,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
that's a wealth equal economy.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.160
Everybody owns.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.960
You know, not everybody's going to own the same stuff,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.600
but everybody's got like a decent chunk of the wealth

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
that exists in the country.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.280
That's the wealth equal economy.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.320
Now, the wealth unequal economy.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.080
This is where basically everything is owned by, like

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.840
a small elite.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.400
You know, it could be,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.760
you know, it could be a thousand people.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.560
It could be,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.880
it could be a million people, 1% of the country.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
They own everything basically.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.400
So in that economy, ordinary people don't own anything.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.640
They don't have a stock portfolio,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.680
they don't own their own house

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.200
so they're likely to be renting

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.400
or they're likely to be owning with a big mortgage.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.760
and everything is owned by this small elite basically.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.680
When you have this situation,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.480
then what you get is

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
like significant transfer payments.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.120
So when you have the equal economy,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.560
there's not really a lot of transfer payments.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.240
So if there are,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.720
they sort of go around because okay,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.000
maybe you own the shops

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.920
that I shop in,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.120
but maybe I own the farm where your food comes from,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.960
you know, sort of ends up kind of balancing out.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.520
We all have a bit of passive income.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.600
There's no significant transfer payments.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.160
But once you have a very unequal economy,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.360
you have these big transfer payments.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.320
So let's assume I'm

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.960
sort of rich elite

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.000
and you're just like a regular person.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.480
One thing to recognise straight away is

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960
the amount of wealth owned by the wealth owners

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.440
per person is much, much,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.400
much higher in the unequal economy.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.840
Because all of the wealth exists

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.560
but now, like it's only distributed between

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
like a thousand people as opposed to like,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000
you know, this country, 60 million people.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.680
So I own everything.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.000
And you're paying me,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.400
you're paying me rent for your house,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.280
you're paying me for the food that you eat.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.200
You're paying me for the energy that you consume.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.960
Every time you go

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.400
shopping, you're paying me to go to the shops,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.680
every time you go to the pub. Because I own the pub.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.560
I own the shop, I own, you know, I own the airport.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.080
You know, I own the hospital. I own the school.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.560
So every time, you're constantly

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.440
having to make this transfer payment to me.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.880
That's the wealth unequal economy.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.400
So what are the differences?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.880
I mean, the first obvious difference

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.480
is in a wealth equal

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.160
economy, you've got a lot more financial security,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.800
and you've got a decent passive income.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.040
Obviously, if you

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.120
if you had a decent chunk of the country's wealth,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.320
you could probably survive

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.240
without working for the same amount of time.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.680
Firstly, because you've got this passive income,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.120
you've got this stock portfolio.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.840
Secondly, because you're not paying rent,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.600
you're not paying a mortgage

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.760
because you own the property that you live in.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.640
So you've got quite a lot of,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.720
a lot of financial security.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.640
You've got passive income.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.200
If you want to stop working for a bit,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.680
if you want to like, pursue your hobbies,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.960
you can do that.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.000
Whereas in the wealth unequal economy,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160
you, the ordinary person doesn't

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.480
have any financial security, right?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.400
You don't have any savings

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.800
you can run down if you lose a job,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.240
you know, you basically you're not paying the rent.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.520
So you're much more financially

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.160
insecure.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.480
The flip of that is

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.280
that the rich have this massive, massive passive income

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.000
that they've got every year,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.800
every year, every month, every week, basically.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.680
What we should point out is like the real world

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.760
is somewhere in between this.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760
So there are some countries

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.120
which are super, super, super unequal.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.240
You know, if you go to sort of

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.160
some countries in, in Africa or Latin America or,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.960
or India,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.200
wealth is very, very unequal.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.800
Ordinary people don't own much.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.840
If they do own stuff, it's like sort of,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.760
they usually have debt behind it.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.200
But you know, this country we're in

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.480
now is it's like a middle point.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.080
So I'm not saying that this country

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.320
is that super wealth unequal space.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.360
We'll talk about that later

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.000
but the real world is somewhere in between.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.240
Yeah.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.040
So that's what you have in the unequal economy,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.400
you have these two groups,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.520
this very, very large group that has no real security.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.440
They have to work in order to live.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.600
They don't have much passive income.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.520
And you have this very small group

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.840
that is extremely wealthy

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.680
and has this massive passive income.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.480
And, you know,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.480
depending on how much inequality you have,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.480
those groups can vary in size basically.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.240
So when you have this large wealth-less group,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.960
they're insecure,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.840
they don't have a lot of income.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.280
So basically most of what they get

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.000
is going to get spent on essentials.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.160
the flip side of that is

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.040
when you have a very,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.520
very wealthy, wealthy group,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.560
they’re small but their income is massive.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.840
You need to understand

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.960
it's important to understand the economy,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.400
the economics of inequality,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.080
the way that very, very wealthy people spend,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.840
which is basically that they

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.520
save almost everything they make.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.840
And this is not because wealthy people are like crazy,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.040
they're obsessed with saving.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.720
It's just simply

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.600
because their passive income is so big.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.680
So, you know, I often use example of Rishi Sunak.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.520
His wealth,

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.840
according to the Sunday Times, is £700 million.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.280
So he'll make like

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.320
like £1 million a week passive income.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.680
So it's not that he's obsessed with saving,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.880
but you know, if you have £1 million

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.400
a week, passive income it’s basically impossible to.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.520
Maybe someone can manage it,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.560
but your average person

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.240
is making £1 million a week passive income.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.840
You know,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.920
even to spend for me, even spend £10,000

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920
I can't even imagine

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920
how you could spend £10,000 a week.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.440
But because their income is so high,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.760
they simply basically have no choice but to save

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.680
the money. So,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.000
so in an unequal society, you have a big chunk,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.560
a big chunk of people

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.640
on essentials,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.640
small group of people, but with massive income,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.520
just saving, saving, saving, saving, saving, saving.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.920
Whereas in the wealth equal society,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.880
because everyone is quite secure,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.480
they will tend to live

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.360
what nowadays

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.840
we consider kind of middle class lives,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.960
which is

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.160
they'll spend money, they'll go on holiday,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.880
they'll go to restaurants, they go to bars.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.200
You know, if they want to reskill or pursue a hobby,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.480
they might take time out of work.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.720
They might take time out of work

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.960
to take care of children

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.600
or to raise children or to travel

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.720
because they have this financial security,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.040
they have these assets they can sell,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.600
they have this passive income. So it's very different.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.520
There's these kind of three types of spending profiles.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.600
Right.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.280
The poor spending profile, which is only essentials.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.560
The rich spending profile,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.240
which is almost exclusively saving, buying assets.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.000
And the middle saving profile,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.280
which is

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.680
like a relaxed sort of modern middle class lifestyle.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.880
So the first big difference

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.000
you have between a more equal society

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.160
and an unequal society is that the unequal society

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.280
as a whole

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.120
cares less about spending and cares more about saving.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.680
And that is

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.280
because if we consider only this,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.000
the passive income that comes from ownership

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.280
in an equal society,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.600
that's all going to middle class

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.360
people and middle class people,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440
they tend to spend most of what they get

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120
over the course of their life.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.520
If they get more money,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.000
they'll tend to increase their spending.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240
Whatever, go on more holidays,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.120
buy a bigger house, this kind of thing.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.520
So if you're churning this passive income to middle

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.840
class people, it’s getting spent, it’s

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.960
getting spent, it’s getting spent.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.640
If instead we take all of that income

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.600
and we give it to this tiny elite group,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.920
of course they will spend a lot of money,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.240
but we can see from the spending profiles

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.480
of the very rich.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.400
You know, if you give £1,000 to a middle class person,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.720
you'll probably spend £600.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.040
You give £1,000 to Rishi Sunak, you’re

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.960
never going to notice right.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.120
He's not going to change his spending at all.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.320
So as we give more and more money to the very rich,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.360
basically societal spending starts to fall.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.520
They don’t want to spend money.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.800
And what they're doing instead is,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.680
well if we look at the behaviour

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.280
of the very, very rich is,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.040
they’re just

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.000
saving, they're just saving,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.120
they're just saving, they're just saving. Which,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.240
you know, saving can mean a few different things.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.880
It can mean investing.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.440
Or it can also mean buying existing assets,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.360
or it can be making loans.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.880
So they’re buying assets, they’re lending money.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.360
If there are good investments around,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.720
they'll try to do investments as well.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.160
So now I think we can consider

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.800
like what these two worlds look like.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.200
When you consider these two things paired together.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.360
Number one, in the wealth unequal world,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.400
there's a lot of people

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.360
who are very financially insecure

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.280
because they don't have savings to fall back on.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.880
They don't own their own house,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.240
they don't own their own food or energy.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.440
They don't have any passive income.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240
These people are very insecure,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.520
and they live in a world

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.320
where all of the

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.160
spending power is held by a very small group of people

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.000
who don't spend a lot of money.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.160
So they live in this world where

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.400
they really, really, really need to work, but society

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.880
doesn't really want to spend that much

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.040
because the group of people with spending power

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.200
is quite small

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.160
and those people tend to save like 98% of their income.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.520
So you can see straight away

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.680
they're in a bad situation, right?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.520
Because you have a world, loads of people need to work.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.000
There's very few potential customers,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.760
and those people don't actually spend much,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.640
like as a proportion of their income.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.040
Add on top of that,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.800
these guys have a ton of wealth, right?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.840
And that wealth includes in a high technology society,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.320
it includes a lot of like labour saving stuff.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.440
So these guys own factories, but high tech factories

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.000
don't actually need a lot of workers.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.160
Increasingly, you know,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.200
we're moving towards an AI world where, you know,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.440
these guys, they've got really high tech factories

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.520
that don't need a lot of workers.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.000
They'll have AI,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.480
which means you need even fewer workers.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.160
I think when you add these things together,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.200
you can basically see

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.000
my conclusion, number one,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.520
which is unequal economies have very low wages.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.200
And that is because,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.160
well, first thing I'll say is

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.520
I think if you look at the world,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.280
you know, it's

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:50.880
not I'm not saying

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.200
this is the only factor that matters,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200
but I think if you look at the world,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.640
you will see that very unequal economies

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.520
have low wages, whereas more middle class economies

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.720
like Western Europe,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.400
like North America, like Japan,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.840
like Australia, have higher wages.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.200
But once you see this logic,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.400
I think you can understand why, right?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.640
Which is when you have a very unequal society,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.240
you have a huge group of people

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.480
desperate to work for a tiny group of people

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.760
who don't spend much money and don't need any workers

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.040
because they've got all of this

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.320
productive capital, productive technology.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.280
So that's number one.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.680
Conclusion number one,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.160
you can put it up there if you want.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.400
Unequal economies have low wages. That's number one.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.840
So the second thing is,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.080
you know, the reason that wages are low

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.240
is because, okay

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.160
there's a lot of desperate workers,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.800
but also because the money

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.280
is being controlled by people who don't want to spend,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.920
what they're doing instead is saving.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.960
So, you know, there's this kind of argument

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.920
and you get this sort of trickle down economics,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.360
which is actually this is good

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.480
because you're giving the money to savers

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.000
and saving is good

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.720
because if we save then, we're going to invest

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.360
and we're going to grow.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.480
The problem you get is

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.880
when there's not a lot of end consumption demand,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.920
companies don't actually want to grow.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.720
They don't want to invest

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.920
because there's not really a lot of customers.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.000
And what companies want,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.160
if they want to grow, is they want customers, right.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.920
So what do rich people do

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.560
when they're in a world that they have all this

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.680
massive passive income, that they're not spending,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.000
but there's not a lot of actual investment

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.640
opportunities around.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.800
The answer is they buy assets.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.520
They buy assets.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.560
And they will try to buy assets from the middle class

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.040
if there is a middle class,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.000
or they will try to buy assets

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.080
from each other basically. And what you have is

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.600
when you have this unequal economy,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.160
you're giving all of the consumption power

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.520
to very, very rich people.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.600
Very rich people, percentage wise,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.720
have a very low demand to consume and a massive

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.280
demand to save.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.400
Basically what these people want is assets.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.160
So the second thing you will see

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.720
is increase in asset prices,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.800
massive increase in asset prices.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.920
Because you're giving all of the money

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.680
to people who are just trying to buy assets.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.040
There's not a lot of investment opportunity.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.560
So they’re buying assets,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.640
they’re buying assets, they’re buying assets.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.120
So I think this makes sense, right.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.240
If you take the consumption power

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.320
away from ordinary people who spend,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320
you give it to rich people who save.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.600
Wages will fall and asset prices will increase.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.000
So these are for me,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
these really are the two key features

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.160
of an unequal economy, low wages, high asset prices.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.760
But you can probably see

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.640
instinctively that these two things

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.200
like interrelate in quite problematic way, right.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.040
Because if wages are low and asset prices,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.160
like including house prices, are high,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.880
and this includes like other

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.600
like basic essentials of life, like,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.920
you know, like the farms

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.960
which produce food or, you know, the power plants

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.080
which produce energy, these are assets as well.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.440
These will be expensive.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.360
What you have is a world

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.240
where ordinary people have no wages

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.560
and the things which they need

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.920
housing, food, energy are really expensive.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.600
This is kind of like a

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.480
really bad combination basically. So

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.880
what you see there is

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.960
basically really high levels of financial insecurity

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.600
because not only are you desperate for work

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.000
and it's hard to get a job,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.560
but the things

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.680
which you need, the basic essentials of life,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.880
housing, food, energy,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.880
the assets that produce those things, including houses,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.240
are super, super, super expensive.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.400
So you have financial instability,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.000
but also you have this...

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.520
It's becomes really, really difficult to climb up

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.520
because if you live in a world where wages are low,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.400
housing is really expensive.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.640
Even if you're able to get a higher than average wage,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.000
it becomes

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.360
quite possible that you'll never be able

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.920
to afford a house, basically.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.800
So there you have the next thing, which is

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.320
basically low social mobility, low social mobility.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.920
And also increasingly work becomes

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.800
like less important in a weird way.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.560
It is important in one way,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.800
because if you don't work, you'll die

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.800
because you need to work to eat.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.000
But work ceases to...

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.320
the idea that if I work hard

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.720
or if I study hard, I get a better job,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.600
I get a house becomes less and less realistic

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.920
because wages are falling, house prices are rising.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.360
You know,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.160
even if you get two or 3 or 4 times the average wage,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.240
it might be that

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.680
something like a house is out of reach.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.800
So you get this kind of crystallisation

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.440
of the class system,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.680
it becomes impossible to work your way up.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.080
The next thing I want to talk about

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.080
is how this leads to a kind of concentration,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.200
economic concentration in capitalism.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.720
So we're talking about a concentration

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.560
of wealth, right.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.880
But this manifests in different ways, right.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.080
So we have really once we concentrate wealth

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.000
we concentrate passive income.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.480
We also concentrate spending power.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.600
Suddenly then if I'm a business and I want to grow,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.720
what am I going to do?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.280
Well, I'm not going to produce stuff that you want

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.440
because you've got no f**king money, right?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.240
You're saving up everything

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.400
you can just to buy a house.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.920
You know you can't afford to go to the pub,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.880
you can't afford to go the restaurants.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.640
So your pub's going to close down.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.400
The restaurants in your area are going to close down.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.920
They're going to get turned into basic

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.920
like slum accommodation.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.760
I'm a business, what am I going to invest in?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.160
What do the rich want?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.080
Because they’ve got so much money,

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.440
so much money, more and more money.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.160
It's growing, it's growing. What do the rich want?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.520
So what you see is increasingly

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.000
this split in industry,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.680
which is industry stops producing for the middle class.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.800
It starts producing just like bare bones

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.560
essentials for the poor

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.800
and increasingly focuses on luxury industries.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800
So I think you're seeing this or you're seeing this...

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.720
I live in London, we're here in London now.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.120
You see this in the...

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.080
you see this literally in the housing stock.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.040
So I grew up,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.600
where I grew up in Ilford in East London

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.960
it used to be...

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.640
It was a poor area when I grew up,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.120
but it was like lower middle

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.320
class, upper working class families.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.560
If you go there now, those small terraced houses,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.440
they've been expanded out backwards, expanded up,

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.640
and they're running up by the room

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.200
to, you know, recent, very, very poor recent migrants.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.080
And what that is, is,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.960
you know, we're no longer

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960
producing middle class housing

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.400
because there's no middle class.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.040
This is the thing.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.440
Inequality means no middle class.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.400
So bare bones essentials.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.800
But obviously now I live closer to central London.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.240
If you live in and around central,

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.760
what people always complain is

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.760
there's only luxury housing being built.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.640
And, you know, that’s an obvious consequence

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.400
of this wealth inequality, which is that

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.560
capitalism will adjust if the middle class has no money

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.880
and the rich have all the money.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.560
We're going to stop producing middle class cars.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.040
We’re going to stop producing middle class housing.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.960
We’re going to try and transition that to the rich.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.120
I’ve got a lot of friends who are dentists.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.800
I've got friends who are doctors

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.840
and the ones who make the most money,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.320
they don't fix teeth of middle class people,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.920
they do plastic surgery

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.440
and cosmetic stuff for rich people.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.320
And that's what you would do

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.520
because these guys have the money. So the next thing is

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.720
wealth inequality leads to industry concentration,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.680
industry concentration.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.560
Businesses no longer really produced for the middle.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.760
They produce for the...

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.400
basics for the poor and luxuries for the rich.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.680
But it's also geographic concentration, right?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.760
So when we we go back and we talk again about

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.640
the relatively equal society

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.080
in a relatively equal society, everyone was an owner,

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.320
everyone was a worker,

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.640
and everyone was a consumer.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.880
And, this is nice, right?

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.960
Because workers need consumers

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.400
and consumers need workers, right.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.440
Like, if you want to work,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.800
you need somebody who’s going to, you know...

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.880
You’re a cameraman, nobody's making videos, you’ve

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.560
got no work, right?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.200
I'm making videos, I need a cameraman.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.240
It works together, right.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.640
These two things come together. But

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.800
once you move to that

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.720
wealth unequal society, you split.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.680
You have a big group of workers,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.680
but they don't really spend much.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.000
They're not really consuming.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.440
And you have this small group of consumers, they’ve

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.640
got a lot of money, but there's not a lot of them.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.920
And they don't need to work, basically.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.640
This causes geographic problems, right?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.000
Because if everyone is a worker

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.520
and everyone is a consumer,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.840
then whenever you have a city,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.160
you've got workers and consumers.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.720
This is like, it works really well, right?

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.360
Because the workers need

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.800
consumers, consumers need workers,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.960
every worker is a consumer.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.680
So basically cities work economically

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.560
because wherever there's people, there's people.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.880
Wherever there's workers, there’s

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.840
consumers, wherever there’s consumers, there's workers.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.400
But once you have this unequal economy,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.800
then the workers are not consumers,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.800
and the consumers are not workers.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.080
So what that means is

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.000
if you cannot attract rich people to your city,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.080
there's no consumers in your city.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.560
And these guys own your city, right?

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.600
They own the housing, they own the food.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.200
You need food.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.520
You need energy, right? Well, these guys got the food.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.800
They got the energy.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.520
What are you offering? You need to offer something.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.040
So if you live in,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.560
you know,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.400
we talk about parts of the North which historically

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.680
were big centres of industry.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.840
You know,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.600
I could keep listing lots and lots of places,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.240
you know, places like Newcastle, places

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.440
like Glasgow, places like Wigan.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.760
Nothing wrong with these places, but,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.800
you know, places that these...

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.440
people have been living there for hundreds of years.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.920
And they used to be like centres of industry.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600
They're struggling now

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.480
because there’s no rich people there.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.600
And then you have workers without consumers.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.960
And if you have workers without consumers,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.720
then there's no jobs.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.920
So what do those consumers have to do?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.760
They have to go to where the rich people are.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.440
And, you know, we've spoken about this in other videos.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.240
I think there's a bit of a misconception

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.440
in modern economics

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.400
that what we're having is a big city, small city split.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.280
But it's actually not

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.680
that it's a rich city, poor city split.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.720
You know I studied in Oxford for two years, it’s

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.240
not a big city, very expensive.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.280
You know, places like Glasgow, places that Newcastle

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.960
much bigger, much, much cheaper.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.360
Cambridge is also expensive.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.280
You know, if you go to the places

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:54.880
where rich people go on

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.040
holiday, phenomenally expensive, you know.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.840
Any popular holiday destination

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.680
for the rich is unbelievably expensive.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.680
If you go to the place where they study, like Oxford,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.160
you know, it's very, very expensive.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.600
So basically,

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.480
geographically the poor people have to move.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.320
You have to move,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.960
you have to go to where the rich people are.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.160
But the problem you have is

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.920
when you have a very unequal economy, you know, if it's

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.160
90% : 10%.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.000
Well there’s 9 poor people for every rich people.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.040
If it’s 99 : 1, it’s

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.880
99 poor people for every rich person, right.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.160
And also, you know, rich people,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.680
they kind of, they tend to like the same things.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.120
They tend to want to live in the same places.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.440
They tend to want to study in the same places.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.880
They tend to go on holiday in the same places.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.360
They're kind of like a community, right?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.800
You know, rich people,

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.760
they don't spend a lot of time in Wigan,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.600
you know, they don't spend a lot of time in Newcastle.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.200
They don't spend a lot of time in Glasgow.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.600
They don't spend a lot of time in Blackpool.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.800
You know, they don't spend...

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.280
they just don't spend time in these places.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.040
And then you’ve got to leave because economically

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.520
people, most people are now workers but not consumer.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.360
So you’ve got to move.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.880
So then you get these big floods,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.560
you get these big floods of people

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.240
from

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.560
the north of England to places like the south east.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.240
But you know, it's not at all UK specific.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.440
You know,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.680
you see

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.680
really, really similar things happening in the US

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.560
where places like the Rust Belt, people are leaving,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.240
they're being moved. They have to move to the coasts.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.480
You see southern Europe, these things are happening.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.000
Spain and Italy, people are leaving.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.880
People are going to like

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.720
the industrial cities of Germany, even the UK.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.040
China, same thing is happening.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.120
Same thing’s happening in China,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.440
same thing is happening in India.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.720
These historical places

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.840
where people have lived for hundreds

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.520
or even thousands of years,

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.960
they don't work in a very unequal society anymore.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.400
So people have to leave. People have to leave.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.000
The problem you have then is

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.480
they have to go to where the rich people are.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.520
There's not a lot of rich people.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.120
So those places become very overcrowded.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.280
So you get this flood of people and then you kind of,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.560
you then create a sort of

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.360
a two world world

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.640
where there's either places

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.360
where there's no rich people

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.280
and no jobs, or places where there are rich people,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.160
poor people having to flood there.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.600
They become extremely dense, extremely overcrowded,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.520
sometimes dirty, sometimes polluted,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.160
but most obviously because everyone has to live there

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.880
really, really expensive,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.280
most obviously really, really expensive,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.880
really, really expensive rents.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.000
So you force these people who

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.600
really, really need work, can't get work,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.000
can't afford a house

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.800
to live in cities with rich people

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.240
where rents are expensive

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.480
and they can't afford to rent. So it's

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.800
kind of disaster on disaster on disaster, isn't it?

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.000
And this is the kind of

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.120
set of mechanics

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.160
which I sort of started to recognise

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.880
when I was a trader.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.600
The next video, I'm going to talk about,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.000
why economists never talk about this.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.680
Because I didn't learn these ideas from university.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.520
So for people who don't know, I did an undergrad

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.680
at London School of Economics, three years,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.720
I did a masters at Oxford for two years.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720
So I’ve studied economics

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.280
at universities for a long time,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.760
these ideas where never taught to me at university.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.440
I learned these as a trader.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.400
We're going to cover that in the next video.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.720
But before I finish this video,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.400
I just want to add one other thing,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.720
which is going back to transfer payments

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.280
in the equal society.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.280
They go around, they go around like in a circle.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.480
In the unequal society, transfer payments go one way.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.680
The people who don't own assets are paying money

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.160
to people who own assets.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.480
The people

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.160
who have the assets

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.840
then use that money to buy the rest of the assets

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.800
Which means next year,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.920
the people who don't own assets have to pay more.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.800
Once you understand this, you can see that

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.520
there's a worryingly accelerating nature to inequality.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.080
Which is the bigger inequality is, the higher

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.240
the amount of transfer payments

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.560
made from the poor to the rich,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.840
which means the higher

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.400
the rate at which the rich dispossessed the poor,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.480
which means the higher the rate of transfer payments.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.520
So this is, and probably the thing

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.720
which sort of caught me the most

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.800
and worried me the most about this.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.120
Mathematically, this is not self containing.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.000
This is the thing

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
that spirals out of control once it becomes...

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.360
and I think this is why,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.840
if you looked throughout history, you'll see that

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.440
in most of history inequality is very high.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.240
Okay.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.760
So that's it.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.680
Quite a big one, second video on the course.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.240
But I think it's really important.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.280
Because it was quite long,

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.920
I'll quickly run down the main points, which is,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.600
when inequality is very high,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.000
there's a high level of financial insecurity.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
There's a high level of transfer

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.520
payments from the both the rich.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.200
There's not a lot of spending,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.840
a lot of poor people trying to work

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.000
for a small amount of rich people

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.160
who have productive capital and don't need workers.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.360
Wages are low. Number one, wages are low.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.320
The rich have enormous amount

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.080
of passive income, way more than they can spend.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.960
They want to invest it,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.840
but there's no investment

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.080
because there's not a lot of spending.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.400
They're trying to buy assets, asset prices are high.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.920
Wages are low, one.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920
Asset prices are high, two.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.240
Industries tend to concentrate

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.960
in whatever the rich people want.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.040
But people are also forced to concentrate on whatever

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.240
the rich people want.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.200
So poor people are forced to flood to the cities.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.880
Places where the rich

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.320
are not living, become very economically deprived.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.560
Places where the rich are living

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.280
become extremely expensive.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.840
Rents become high,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.920
and because the poor paying lots of money to the rich,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.440
inequality tends to increase

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.760
and the situation tends to get worst year after year.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.480
Okay, that's number two.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.040
This is one of the more

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.280
depressing videos on the channel.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.920
I suppose, but it's really important to understand it.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.360
And you know,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.720
I made a lot of money betting on these things.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.760
I think it's what's happening,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.280
it’s helped me to make the really good predictions

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.000
we've made on the channel.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.720
Next video will cover why

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.560
economists never talk about it if it's so important.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.400
And we'll keep building up more and more videos

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.800
to build a really comprehensive course

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.960
of how inequality affects the economy.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.480
And that’s it, video done.
