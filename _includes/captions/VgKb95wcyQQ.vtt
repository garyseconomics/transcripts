00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
So I've been wanting to do a

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.360
video about immigration for ages.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.880
There's two subjects

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.360
that I've wanted to do videos about,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.040
for ages that I've not done, which is one immigration

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.560
and two inheritance.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.200
And, I've avoided doing them

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.240
because they are such contentious issues

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.360
and they're so serious.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.200
And I feel like if you do them, you better do them

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.520
f**king well, basically. And,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.200
I really want to do a video on immigration

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920
because I see it becoming like a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160
bigger and bigger and bigger issue.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.360
But I feel like it's such an important video

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240
that I don't f**k it up, basically.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.880
And I feel like

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.720
because I'm tired,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.040
I just feel like I don't have the energy to do it,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.680
like the justice that it deserves.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.080
But obviously we've got the election coming up now.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.040
We're talking about, you know,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.200
we did our election video, right?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.520
We put it out, like, I guess maybe a week or two ago.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.280
And, we didn't talk about the rise of Reform.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.760
Another thing

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
we didn't really talk about is the fact that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.880
the Conservatives

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.000
could possibly get pumped so hard in this election

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.120
that they drop down into third or fourth place.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.880
They probably wont.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.240
But it's definitely possible.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.200
And,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.960
you know, of course, we have this two party system

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.600
which makes it, like almost impossible

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.160
to, like, replace the top two parties.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.840
And the top two parties have been the top tea parties

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.880
for like a hundred years,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.160
where like Labour replace the Liberals or whatever.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.000
And to be honest, I think it's a stupid system.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.280
I think proportional representation is a better system.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.000
I think when you have this two party system,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.920
like what we've got now,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.120
you can get this kind of stupid situation

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.600
where both the parties are basically complete

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.760
shit and like, you got no choice but to vote for them.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.120
But also it's undemocratic really,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.520
because all of the power is within the parties,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520
you know, like you only have two choices.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
You know,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.960
they’re kind of similar really like all of the...

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.760
The power is not really within the people.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.680
You know, look at Rishi Sunak like,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.560
you know, people voted in Boris Johnson.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.800
They kicked him out.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.040
The party members voted in Theresa May.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.920
They kicked her.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.640
So not Theresa May. Liz Truss, they kicked her out.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.560
And then the MPs, in some ways,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.720
here’s Rishi Sunak, he's the guy we want.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.640
You know, it's really undemocratic, right? But,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.440
so I guess there's something kind of sexy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.840
and kind of something exciting about, well,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.720
we can actually kick out

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.160
one of these two major parties.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560
And, you know, I get excited about that.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.360
You know, I think that,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.200
to be completely honest,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.000
I think the conservatives are basically

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600
totally bought by the very rich.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.160
And I just think, like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.200
our campaign

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.320
to reduce inequality,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.080
I don't think we're gonna get anything under them.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.960
Don't get me wrong, like,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.400
we need to be willing to be flexible.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.760
And if the conservative

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.440
became of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.400
like a, like a meaningful vehicle for it,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
you have to use what you can buy like

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.600
you can't see happening right.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.800
So it's exciting to see them getting like, smashed,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400
but then like

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400
when you see

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
the growing sense

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.560
that we see it in the YouTube comments,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.800
which is the problem is immigration.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.640
The problem is immigration, the problem is immigration.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.960
You see Nigel Farage

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360
coming back, the growth of the Reform Party.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.200
It’s hard to even be excited

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.760
about the conservatives being smashed,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.640
because if that happens,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.360
they might get replaced by Reform.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.080
Nigel Farage might take over the Conservative Party,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.840
and it's just really hard to see

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.200
to see anything

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.480
happening other than

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.160
a new right wing alternative coming up that is more

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.360
anti immigration.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.440
That is more xenophobic

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.880
that could over time

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.800
potentially become more racist, right.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.840
So it's hard for me to even be excited

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.240
about something

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.560
that I would have liked to be excited about,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.040
which is the demise of the Conservative Party.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920
So let's just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560
talk about this immigration thing.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.240
I haven't got, like, a prepped video, right.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.840
The reason I struggle to talk about it

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.000
is because I know

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.680
first things first, right,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.400
The target audience for this channel,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.760
nobody's excluded from this channel.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.520
But this channel, for me,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.080
is about connecting

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.840
with just ordinary people,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.760
ordinary people who feel like they

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
are not being spoken to by economists on the news.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.200
They don't understand what those guys are saying.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.040
They're not being represented, that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.720
nobody's on their side, nobody's.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.600
That's all I want, you know.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.040
So, you know, you're talking about, you know,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.560
basically people who might not have like,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.000
you know,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.200
a degree in economics from Cambridge or whatever.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.520
But of course, you know,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.240
it's also a campaign

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.120
to raise tax on the very rich,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.800
to reduce inequality, to improve living standards.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
And for that reason, we've always had

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.280
lot of support

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.400
from the political left

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.280
and the people who like first sort of help, you know,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.760
you know, one of the first people who ever, like,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.600
helped me, like, grow my profile was,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600
you know, Grace Blakeley, you know,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.280
who's an economist on the political left.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.720
And of course, like

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.640
a lot of our early growth came from Novara,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.400
which is like a big political left channel

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.320
So even though I don't see myself

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.640
as talking to the political left,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.240
like we've had a lot of support

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.680
from the political left, right, and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.840
a lot of the media

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.640
and people like Nigel Farage

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.560
and of course, people like,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.600
increasingly people in the Conservative Party.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.640
They use immigration as a wedge issue. Right.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.320
So we should explain what a wedge issue is, right?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.080
A wedge issue

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.080
is when a political group sees

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.400
an issue which divides their opponents

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.320
from the general public.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.120
And the conservatives know

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.720
that a lot of the political left

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.920
hates anything that's anti-immigration.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.840
But they know that a lot of ordinary people

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.560
think immigration is too high.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560
In particular,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.400
a lot of ordinary

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.480
people think that the reason why they can't get a house

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.400
and the reason why they can't get a well-paid job

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.920
is because of immigration.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.400
And you can understand why they think that, right?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.640
There was a piece on the news, Sky news.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.000
So like totally mainstream

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.280
news the other day, Sky news,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.640
housing crisis and immigration.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.520
And it's a really simple narrative to make.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.200
Which is these guys are coming over,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.520
they live in houses.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.040
You need houses. They compete with you for houses.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.640
They compete with you for jobs.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.680
They're bringing your wages down.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.480
They're pushing house prices up, right.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.440
So ordinary people who are

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.160
struggling are being told these things.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.840
You can understand why they become

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840
anti-immigration, right?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.080
Because life is getting hard for most,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.480
you know, for most people,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.640
the most obvious thing is getting a house

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.360
or getting a job.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.400
These are like some of the most obvious problems.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.120
And they're being told, the reason you can't do

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.600
that is because of immigration, right?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.520
I don't personally think the primary reason

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.360
why life is getting harder

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.960
is because of immigration, right?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.640
I think the primary reason that life is getting hired

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.640
is because of this growing inequality.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.320
But this is what people are being told,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.640
people are being told it's immigration and it's...

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.680
My voice is a lot less loud

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.880
than these other voices, right?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.240
These are the voices, like pushing against immigration.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.880
And, the truth of the matter is,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880
I don't know how to stop it.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.720
I don't know how to stop

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.160
ordinary people who are being told the reason that they

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.000
can't afford the house,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.960
the reason they can't get a good job

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.440
is because of foreigners.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.560
I don't know how to stop them from believing that.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.280
And I'm very, very confident that

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.680
the economic situation will get worse

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.480
because the inequality will get worse.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.840
And, you know, we're going to get a Labour government

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.840
that is not going to deal with the inequality.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.360
They're not going to successfully

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.320
stop the fall in living standards.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.800
And people are gonna want something new, right?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.480
Like,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.920
you can see the Conservative Party has basically lost

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920
almost completely economic

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.480
credibility at this point, right.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.560
So we've got a Labour government, okay.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.440
You're second in charge.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.760
What are you going to do?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.640
They’re not going to fix it, right.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.960
They're not going to fix it.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.600
So then people are going to be like, all right,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.760
who's next? And it's really, really obvious who's next.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.680
It's really obvious who is next in line,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.000
it is Nigel Farage and is the...

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.880
it is reduce immigration, it is stop immigration.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.960
And I don't think that

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.800
those guys will win.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800
But you can see them taking over,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.040
you can see them taking over.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.560
And I don't f**king know what to do it, basically.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.680
I don't know what to do about it.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.960
And you can see it divides, the sort of,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.240
ordinary people from the political left, and you can...

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.280
you know, I can see that the political left is...

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.520
a lot of it is going to try and hang

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.040
to, like, no,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840
whatever they don't, they're going to

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.400
consider that they have a

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.120
like a moral need to protect the immigrants, right.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.560
And then that's going to divide them more.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.680
And then the left are going to die, right.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.080
And then

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.120
the right is going to come in

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.960
and they're going to try to reduce immigration,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.880
but that's not actually going

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.240
to fix the living standards problem,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.800
because it's not the actual cause of the problem.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.600
So they're going to say, well, we need to go further,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.880
you know what I mean?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.800
And it's really hard for me

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.000
not to be reminded of what happened

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.480
in the early 20th century.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.840
And, you know,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.680
people in the comments, you’re

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680
not talking about immigrants,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.880
you're not talking about immigrants...

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.960
I don't know what to say to them,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.080
you know, what do I say to them?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.760
You know, because I don't think that is the problem.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.640
But then you see people on the political left,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.840
and I think often

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.960
sometimes the political left

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.120
has a kind of a condescending,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.680
sneering attitude towards these people.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.280
And

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.840
these people

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.880
are struggling to pay the bills

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.520
and they're being told it's

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.160
because the immigrants, you know, I mean.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.880
We need to offer them something.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.280
You know, we need to offer them an alternative.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.680
And I've been trying to build

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.680
like a political coalition on the left of like,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.160
let's make inequality the big thing.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.200
Let's make inequality the big thing.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.280
And I've been failing.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.920
It's f**king hard, basically.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.320
But,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.240
I think we’ll put this one out after the election one.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.400
And, I just want to say, like,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400
to the people who think it's

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.120
because of the immigrants, like,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.640
I understand why you’re saying that

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.400
and I understand that life is hard, but, you know,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.560
I just...

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.160
I don't think that's the cause,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.280
you know, I don't think that's the cause.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.080
And that doesn't mean

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.560
I think we should have more immigration.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.080
And it doesn't mean

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.160
I don't think that we should have less immigration.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.000
I think this...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.160
listen, I want to tax rich people, right.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.080
The rich are getting richer

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.680
and richer and richer and richer.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.240
Ordinary living standards are collapsing.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.320
I want to tax rich people. The rich don't want that.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040
And you

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.640
can see

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.800
living standards collapsing and you want something.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.120
They have to offer you something, right?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.040
They're offering you, let's kick out the immigrants

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.400
and they're going to offer that more and more.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.360
And it's,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.520
this has happened again and again

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.520
throughout history, right?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.960
It's happened again and again

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.280
throughout history that inequality rises,

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.920
living standards fall

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.880
and the rich,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.240
the easiest thing for them to do

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.120
is to sell you a scapegoat.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.200
They can sell you a scapegoat,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.240
and then they can use that to divide the working class.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.480
And you know, I'm talking to you here from Britain.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.840
The working class is very multiracial.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.960
My grandma was an immigrant.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.680
You know what I mean? Like.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.520
This

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.280
could be used to very effectively

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.120
divide the working class and make them hate each other.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.400
And if that happens, we're f**ked.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.040
We're totally f**ked. And

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.000
I don't know how to stop it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.840
Yeah, I don't know how to stop it.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.440
All I can do is keep saying what the real cause is

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.920
and keep offering my alternative. And,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.760
I think if you manage to reduce inequality,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.920
if you redistribute away from the very rich towards

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.760
working people, cut working people's taxes,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.720
we can have much higher levels of living standards.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.440
Ordinary people can afford their own homes

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.760
like my dad did,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.520
like my friends dads did,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.920
who were themselves immigrants

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.480
and came over with nothing.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.800
I think the problem is inequality.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.280
And, I'm honestly, I'm really worried.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.880
I'm really, really worried that,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.440
the left's not going to get its act together.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.760
It's not going to centralise inequality.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.000
The right is going to drive a massive wedge

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.960
between the left and the general public,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.440
and the left will not win an election.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.080
And we end up with increasingly

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.400
xenophobic governments which veer towards eventually

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880
racism and,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.000
you know,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.240
look at history, look at history, look at history and

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.600
that's not because I love immigrants.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.920
That's not because I hate immigrants.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.680
That is, you know, I hope

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.560
that people can see that

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.680
that is my clear eyed economic analysis.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.840
And now, you know,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.440
I've got no skin in the game on this,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.000
you know what I mean?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.960
You know, I'm obviously a white person here in Britain.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.360
You know,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.560
when the immigrants get kicked out,

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.040
they probably won't come for me,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.560
you know what I'm saying?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.120
This can really effectively divide the working class.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.920
Really effectively divide the working class.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.280
And I'm worried about it.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.040
I'm worried about it.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.760
So, I'll still be happy

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.240
if Jacob Rees-Mogg loses his seat though.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.720
But

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.080
there's bigger battles to fight, and,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.200
we need to be united.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.720
And if we can't unite across things like

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.120
race and ethnic origin,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.240
they’re trying to divide us in other lines as well.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.600
Gender, age,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.440
whether you're from London

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.840
or whether you're from the North.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.760
If you own a house or not.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.760
If we’re divided we’ll lose and,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.600
we can't allow that to happen. And,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.320
I wish I had easier ways, I wish I knew how to stop it.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.000
But I'll just keep doing what I do and I hope it works.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.640
And that's all we can do.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.240
What's that one thing Labour could do when they win?

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.120
Labour are going to win.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.400
Like what

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.640
can they do in power to stop a kind of rise of...

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.480
Labour need to fix the economic problem.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.080
Labour need to fix the economic problem.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.000
But I'll tell you one thing

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.680
I think we could do from a comms perspective.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.480
I think we need to...

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.400
We need better class representation.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.600
We need better class representation on TV.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.080
We need better class representation because

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.800
I grew up in London,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.400
I grew up in a very, very immigrant area.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.520
You know, I mean, it's like it's a very Pakistani area.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.480
I grew up, you know.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.760
The kids I grew up with, come from Pakistani families.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.640
Okay. Their religious background is different.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.880
Their cultural background is different.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.400
They've got the exact same economic problems

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.440
as my f**king sister,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:20.720
you know what

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.280
I mean,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.800
can't afford the rent, can't afford to buy a house,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.800
can't get decent wage.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.040
Economically we're facing the same problems, you know,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.640
you know, the white working class

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.280
and the nonwhite working class face

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.200
exactly the same economic problems, you know, and...

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.120
If you...

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.760
We need to

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.840
put working class people...

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.040
And it's not just about race, it's about age.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.800
It's about gender.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800
It's about whether you're from London,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.640
whether you're from the North.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.120
You know, we need to put these people together.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.280
We need to

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.480
show, show, listen,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.000
these people who might have different backgrounds

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.240
and different identities in other ways

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.040
have the same economic problems

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.880
because we need, you know,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.960
the working class

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.000
is very multi-ethnic and it is, you know,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.480
it's older people and younger people

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.760
and it's people from London and it’s

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.840
people from f**king Grimsby and people from Glasgow,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.920
people from the countryside, you know, it's like.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.320
We need to be,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.160
I think there's a...

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.160
we need to be...

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.760
And, you know, I would like to do it

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.160
more on this channel if we, you know,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.560
we struggle for time and we struggle for my energy.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.080
But I would love to get working

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.800
class people from different backgrounds,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.120
older people, younger people,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.320
you know, together on this channel

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.080
and put them forward.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.280
But

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.880
Labour, Labour need to fix the economic problem,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.960
you know, and...

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.520
We need to make it more about class.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.280
You know, we need to make it more about class.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.200
Because if we allow ourselves

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.400
to be divided on things like race and,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400
it'll be other things as well,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.520
I mean, age is a massive dividing factor

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.520
in British politics, and it's not just race.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.240
But, you know, this is one thing

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.960
everybody watching can do that, can be like, listen,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.200
can I try to bridge those divisions

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.640
rather than build those divisions

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.920
and it's not always easy.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.440
But it's something that we have to do.
