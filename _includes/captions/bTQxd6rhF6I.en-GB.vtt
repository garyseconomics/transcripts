00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm Gary Stevenson 
welcome back to Gary's&nbsp;Economics 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.260
today we're going to&nbsp;explain 
"Trickle Down Economics"

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.480
okay so trickle-down economics is the term used&nbsp;
to describe the idea that if you allow rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.440
people to get a lot of money, to accumulate&nbsp;
a lot of money, it will grow your economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.940
on the basis that because rich people have a much&nbsp;
higher rate of saving from the income if they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.040
money they will save more and that will lead to&nbsp;
more economic investment and more economic growth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.120
this is important now because here in the UK&nbsp;
we have a new government Liz Truss is a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.340
prime minister and they are saying they want&nbsp;
to drive growth in the country by cutting tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.280
on rich people which will lead to the rich having&nbsp;
more money and growing the economy so we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.160
to talk today about where the idea comes from&nbsp;
and basically why it doesn't work so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.420
the first thing you need to understand is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.420
what is investment? and what is growth?&nbsp;
Okay so as an individual you might think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
if you buy a new house that is investment&nbsp;
from your perspective or if you buy

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.940
stocks and shares that is investment from your&nbsp;
perspective it's important to understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.420
investment will only grow the country if it&nbsp;
is investment in new productive assets so for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.620
example if you build new houses or if we build&nbsp;
more wind turbines or if we build factories or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.260
if we build more productive equipment or if we&nbsp;
upgrade the machinery on our farms this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.440
increase productivity in the country and it will&nbsp;it
will cause growth so the idea behind trickle down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.580
economics if you give money to rich people they'll&nbsp;
save it, then invest it and the country will grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.820
and this is quite a sort of it's a simple idea&nbsp;
from economics which is if people save more then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.140
there must be more investment but what this&nbsp;
misses is that when rich people save money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.520
they have other options other than simply&nbsp;
investing in building new assets right they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080
don't need to just build new houses or build&nbsp;
new wind turbines the other thing that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
can do and often what they do do is buy the&nbsp;
existing assets so you know in the last few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860
years we've seen a massive increase in the cash&nbsp;
holdings of very rich people in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.360
and they didn't rush out and build new houses or&nbsp;
build new wind turbines or build factories in many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
cases what they did is they gave that money to&nbsp;
their children and the children used that money to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.260
buy houses and that's why we've seen in the last&nbsp;
few years a very big increase in house prices in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.820
this country the UK and also many other countries&nbsp;
at the same time as a very big increase in cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.000
Holdings of the rich so I think this is the first&nbsp;
problem in trickle down economics is if we give&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
cash to the rich they're not going to necessarily invest&nbsp;
in building new assets they might simply use that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.980
money to buy existing assets which means that you&nbsp;
and your kids can't afford existing assets so in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.140
the last few years I've said a lot on this channel&nbsp;
your average Rich individual has accumulated about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.060
100-200 grand cash that means that people from&nbsp;
poor families who haven't accumulated that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.720
their deposits are no longer enough for them to&nbsp;
compete with the rich families so what you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.460
then is that all this money has done in this&nbsp;
case has meant that instead of younger people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.840
from poorer families buying houses, younger people&nbsp;
from rich families have bought those houses so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.740
it can lead simply to rich people buying extra&nbsp;
assets the other thing that rich people will do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.380
is they'll lend the money out you know um they'll&nbsp;
sit on the money and they'll lend the money that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.680
might sound good if rich people lend more money&nbsp;
out but if rich people lend more money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.080
then not only are they lending it possibly to&nbsp;
you but they're also lending it to other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.260
so that means that when you go to buy a house you&nbsp;
are competing with other people who can get bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.480
mortgages which means that house prices will go&nbsp;
up and the end result is that it's harder for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.220
poor people with lower deposits to buy houses&nbsp;
because they can't get those big mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.260
and the people that do buy houses will end&nbsp;
up having bigger mortgages so the two big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.880
consequences that we've seen from giving cash to&nbsp;
the rich are higher house prices and fewer people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.820
from poor families being able to afford houses and&nbsp;
also bigger mortgages so more debt for ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.560
families so I think this is the the key thing&nbsp;
that you need to realize right when rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.580
are given money they don't necessarily&nbsp;
go and build a wind farm you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.300
the main thing they'll do is they'll buy&nbsp;
existing houses and that does nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.000
to improve the productivity of the country all&nbsp;
it does is make wealth inequality worse right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.960
because it means that ordinary families have&nbsp;
less assets and richer families get more assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.300
and that that brings us to this this big&nbsp;
point of you know 'does it work?' and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.340
we've got a great example to look at to&nbsp;
explain to us whether it works or not which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.800
the idea is if they have money they're not&nbsp;
going to build the wind farm themselves right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.500
what they're going to do is they're going&nbsp;
to lend the money to the corporation tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.540
by the wind farm and the idea is that means that&nbsp;
corporations can then borrow at low interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.980
so hopefully they'll go and invest and they'll&nbsp;
build these things which will grow our economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.240
but we've had a really long period of trying&nbsp;
this out right since 2008 we had 14 years of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.920
basically zero interest rates and that meant that&nbsp;
corporations could borrow basically for free for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.040
that whole period did they then make loads of&nbsp;
Investments well if we look at that period&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.700
2008-2022 is actually one of the lowest growth&nbsp;
and lowest investment periods in the whole of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.420
British economic history so when we actually tried&nbsp;
giving corporations access to very cheap loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.720
they didn't invest they they in many cases they&nbsp;
simply accumulate the money and used it to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.540
existing assets then after that in Covid we&nbsp;
tried this period of just absolutely smashing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.940
tons of cash to rich people and did it create&nbsp;
economic growth did it create boom economy well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.440
what we actually saw was massive increase in&nbsp;
inequality, massive increase in house prices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.080
massive increased inflation and a collapse in the&nbsp;
cost of living and that is because of the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.620
fact which which I mentioned in last week's video&nbsp;
money is the resource which we use to determine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.040
how we allocate the real resources like housing&nbsp;
food energy so if you give a ton of money to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.720
rich they will also consume more housing food&nbsp;
energy you know there's more space if you give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.400
them money loads of money they will use more&nbsp;
stuff which means ultimately the prices go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.480
and you guys will get less stuff so I think&nbsp;
if we look at the reality of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.520
it hasn't worked if you understand the theory&nbsp;
of the situation there's this very simplistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.360
theory which they'll save more than invest more&nbsp;
but as soon as you take a step back and realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.560
they don't need to invest in new assets they&nbsp;
can simply just buy existing assets which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.040
ordinary families have less assets then you&nbsp;
see that what this actually does is increase that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.900
spiral of increasing inequality which mirrors&nbsp;
that spiral of decreasing living standards so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.520
you know I understand the theory you know&nbsp;
you know despite what I sound like I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.760
studied a bit of Economics I've got two&nbsp;
Economics degrees I understand the theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.160
um I think the theory is horribly naïve and&nbsp;
it simply neglects to realise that rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.120
don't need to invest in new assets they can&nbsp;
simply buy existing assets from poorer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.840
more ordinary families um so I think it's really&nbsp;
really important that we push back against this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.800
um because if you don't push back against&nbsp;
it then things can happen like what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.220
two weeks ago where the Government tried to&nbsp;
massively slash taxes for rich people and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.400
will massively decrease your standard of living&nbsp;
um I think what is very interesting is that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.460
know financial markets refused it and I think&nbsp;
that is in this instance very very fortunate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:15.420
but that doesn't take away from the fact that we&nbsp;
are still in a situation where during Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.160
£600 billion was transferred from the government&nbsp;
to the rich, now as part of trying to fix the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.820
energy crisis another 150 billion pounds is going&nbsp;
to be transferred from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.960
they're trying to convince you it's going to grow&nbsp;
the economy but in reality it's going to mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.180
ordinary families lose their assets, younger&nbsp;
people from ordinary families can't buy homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.460
um the rich will get a bigger and bigger share&nbsp;
of consumption which means ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.900
living standards will decrease so basically&nbsp;
the end message of this video is that um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.640
and I think people already know this&nbsp;
trickle down economics it is an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.800
there's some thinking behind it 
it's&nbsp;horribly simplistic and it doesn't work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.060
um if you allow inequality to increase especially&nbsp;
if you're allowed to increase massively like it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.900
has done in the last few years they're living&nbsp;
standards for ordinary families will decrease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.580
um oh the last thing I wanted 
to add was you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.660
if you give a ton of money to rich people&nbsp;
even if they do give it to businesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.580
businesses are not going to grow not going to&nbsp;
invest in growing their the size of their product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.220
if the middle class can't spend and what we've&nbsp;
done in the last few years is massively crushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.940
the spending power of ordinary families so&nbsp;
if you combine these two things at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.380
time crushing the spending part of ordinary&nbsp;
families giving a ton of cash to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.880
of course they're not going to invest in growing&nbsp;
businesses you know what we're actually seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.120
is businesses shutting down you know local pubs&nbsp;
are shutting down because people cannot afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.500
to go to those places so um if&nbsp;
you want to grow the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.140
you need to have a strong consumer businesses&nbsp;
will not invest and grow unless there's customers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.620
and in order to do that you need to get more&nbsp;
money in the pockets of ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.600
um if you give it instead to the rich, prices will&nbsp;
go up and ordinary families will get poorer so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.500
um so yeah um trickle down economics it doesn't&nbsp;
work um send this video to your friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.100
family, maybe who believe in it um and yeah help&nbsp;
us push back and fight against it thank you

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.820
at the moment these guys are profiting from a&nbsp;
crisis that is going to keep our economy in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.380
stump for 50 years. there is one other thing&nbsp;
they can do with that mass amount of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.420
they can buy your mum's house
