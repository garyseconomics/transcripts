00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.340
I think the thing what I believe with the thing&nbsp;
that gives me hope is I honestly believe if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.340
people understood what was happening here&nbsp;
they would not accept it and we would get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.320
change if people knew the direction that we as a&nbsp;
society are heading and where we're going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.360
70,80,90% of people would vote&nbsp;
against it and the only reason that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.040
we are able to make Society worse and&nbsp;
worse and worse and worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.480
the way we are doing is because people are&nbsp;
misinformed and not giving good information

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.540
for me I just wanted to get you on the&nbsp;
channel basically because I know you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
been watching it from the start and I know&nbsp;
like your mates watching stuff like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.140
and really I just wanted to get somebody in who&nbsp;
watches it to sort of take the place of the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.560
who watch it and ask the questions that they might&nbsp;
be wondering things they don't understand things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.460
they would like to hear more of yeah I mean I&nbsp;
dip in and out to be honest with you I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.580
up to date fully on the most recent so I guess&nbsp;
it'll be good to know kind of where you're at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.520
and what today's what you're looking to work on&nbsp;
today yeah yeah so today basically I wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.960
get seem to come over in the evening so we could&nbsp;
film some stuff that was like a bit more chill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.240
basically because sin is going away and then I'm&nbsp;
going away so we're not going to be able to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
for the whole of November yeah um and the channels&nbsp;
really growing loads of new people are coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.060
um and we've been like really like doing&nbsp;
up to speed stuff on what's Happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.100
but we're not gonna have to do that in&nbsp;
the next month so like I wanted to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.680
do some stuff that was a bit more educational and&nbsp;
it's a bit more chill to really give the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.980
who are watching the understanding basically&nbsp;
that they're going to need going forward because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.960
I'm not going to be able to give like on the&nbsp;
button analysis of the news every week but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.440
is not is there a requirement to do that though&nbsp;
with this whole idea something big happens not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.660
necessary I know that some people watch this&nbsp;
channel because they want to understand what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.860
happening and like when big things happen&nbsp;
like last week so much happened right like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
prime minister resign we had this big budget which&nbsp;
people like for example when the budget came out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.040
like we arranged the emergency shoot date because&nbsp;
it's like we cannot put out like some sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.080
you put out videos like boom on the Moment Like&nbsp;
This what's happening now and sometimes it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320
educational videos we had like an educational&nbsp;
video and it was like after something mad like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.520
that has happened we just have to respond to that&nbsp;
thing that happened you know what I mean like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.360
yeah it's like it's almost like a responsibility&nbsp;
because some people oh my God crazy storm going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.440
some people are relying on us for analysis and&nbsp;
like um but we don't need ultimately this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.340
not a news channel you know this is not BBC News&nbsp;
this isn't this is a channel about helping people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.920
understand the whole big picture situation and&nbsp;
how we can improve that over the long term because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.720
it has to be over the long term because we are&nbsp;
not going to win this in the short term but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.300
can win this in the long term and what is this&nbsp;
what is this that we're winning number one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.300
stopping the collapse in people's living standards&nbsp;
that's the number one and in my opinion the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.540
way to do that is to stop the massive increase&nbsp;
in inequality um and the way I envisage that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.920
is it is going to come from people&nbsp;
insisting on it people demanding it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.520
you know because before I did this I did a&nbsp;
lot of different things I went to University&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.320
change is not going to come from there and&nbsp;
I bounced around like think tanks and things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.940
like that and there's good people in these think&nbsp;
tanks and stuff like that but ultimately these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.960
think tanks they talk to the politicians and&nbsp;
the politicians say oh we're not going to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.720
you a wealth tax because people don't like it&nbsp;
people are not going to vote for it you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.200
so you know these Think Tank guys are richer&nbsp;
people the politicians are richer people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.040
they're in their little space they're not&nbsp;
really getting hurt by it they're not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.120
to give you unless you demand it so for me what&nbsp;
I saw was nobody is talking to the people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.360
are actually being hurt by this you know what&nbsp;
I mean that was the thing that frustrated me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.360
the most I think about the way that like the&nbsp;
whole conversation about economics hmm it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.220
like Rich professors Rich journalists Rich guys&nbsp;
on the TV rich people writing articles you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.420
and yet none of them are really making the&nbsp;
effort to turn around and talk to the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.180
that are getting hurt you know I'm very aware that&nbsp;
I am not getting personally hurt you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.860
mean yeah and but then would you say you're&nbsp;
not getting personally hurt on the basis of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.640
what you've accumulated for yourself or because&nbsp;
of your lifestyle I mean I mean financially I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
don't because I own assets you know what I&nbsp;
mean and you know I have wealth and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320
these are the people you know people with work&nbsp;
for people who've been protected you know yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.360
um but like you're not an extra struggling person&nbsp;
on a personal level but I understand like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.580
you and I both know what is happening you know&nbsp;
what I mean there's families that are literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.040
worried about feeding their kids here right and&nbsp;
you know you know I don't have to worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.220
their own getting paid I don't have to worry about&nbsp;
the Bills game you know yeah the bills got to 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.660
grand and I could still pay them yeah it would be&nbsp;
expensive I could still pay them you know so I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.200
just aware that there's people are being hurt like&nbsp;
viscerally and I'm not getting hit in that way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.740
um but then it just drives me mad to see all of&nbsp;
these richer people having a discussion about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.520
oh we can't do it because people are not going&nbsp;
to vote for it who are you which of you is even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.180
explaining to the people what's happening you know&nbsp;
what I mean so what what I really wanted like oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.360
before I started this YouTube I was writing&nbsp;
articles you know I wrote for the guardian I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.760
wrote open democracy you know and it got picked up&nbsp;
by these kind of economy people and I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.820
these are a lot of these people are good people&nbsp;
they want to make positive change happen right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.680
but I was very aware that you know people that I&nbsp;
grew up with I'm not reading those articles you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.660
know what I'm eating yeah and I just felt like who&nbsp;
is talking to these people you know I mean like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.240
if these people are going to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;
over at the very least they deserve to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.840
have explained to them what's happening you&nbsp;
know what I mean but instead you just get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.480
baffled by the stuff on the TV in the news so&nbsp;
um that's like for me ultimately at his heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.240
I think the thing what I believe with the thing&nbsp;
that gives me hope is I honestly believe if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.240
people understood what was happening here&nbsp;
they would not accept it and we would get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.220
changed if people knew the direction that we as&nbsp;
a society are heading and where we're going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.000
70 80 90 of people would vote against it&nbsp;
and the only reason that we are able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.460
make Society worse and worse and worse and worse&nbsp;
and worse the way we are doing is because people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.600
are misinformed and not giving good information&nbsp;
if people knew what is happening what was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.360
to happen they were not accept it so I feel like&nbsp;
this misinformation sorry yeah is that intentional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.140
um there's a degree of intentional misinformation&nbsp;
so you know if you look for example at like Rupert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.360
Murdoch's news Empire like they definitely want&nbsp;
to push don't tax the rich they'll leave they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.200
definitely want to push that this is because of&nbsp;
immigrants this is because of foreigners you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.700
um and that is I think Kim protecting himself&nbsp;
and his class as a billionaire and you know if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.860
you look at things like the iea which is a big&nbsp;
right-wing think tank that gets funded by rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.900
people and they put people on the news you know&nbsp;
like I saw a clip the other day of a lot of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.460
American news channels and they were all talking&nbsp;
about how amazing Liz trust's Economic Policy was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:43.320
and when I saw that what that said to me was look&nbsp;
how much money is going into convincing you that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.540
this is good like it's I think it's more obvious&nbsp;
in that American Media where like there's so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:54.000
aggressively right with media you know it's funded&nbsp;
by billionaires but to a later extent it happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.440
here you know who owns The Daily Mail billionaire&nbsp;
you know who owns a telegraph millionaire who owns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.000
a times billionaire you know what I mean all&nbsp;
of these newspapers are owned by billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.420
you know so you know who owns Skype billionaire so&nbsp;
like and you know I speak to people in journalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.200
and they'll they'll tell you of course there's&nbsp;
a degree to which individual journalists get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.780
freedom but ultimately there is an editorial line&nbsp;
that comes down from the top you know and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.340
if when the money is coming from rich people it&nbsp;
influences the way people say it the way what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.180
people say so I think there is a degree to which&nbsp;
it is intentional which is rich people pushing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.460
narrative but there is also a degree to which it&nbsp;
just comes down to the fact that the media is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.360
really designed to inform you it is designed to&nbsp;
entertain you this is something I've spoken about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.100
some other videos which is like I've worked in&nbsp;
the city you know say what you like about the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.580
there are some liquids there and there are some&nbsp;
guys that are not that smart at the end of the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.680
these guys are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] paid to be right and they're&nbsp;
trying to be right you know at least a lot of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.220
are you know what I mean and they can't just they&nbsp;
can't just chat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they can't put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.380
trades on they have to try and be right because&nbsp;
if you look at the media you know I get called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.820
to go on the news right I know what it's going to&nbsp;
be like it's just blah blah blah blah blah what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:08.160
sounds good what looks good no like and I've I've&nbsp;
cut down on doing media because I started coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.340
away from them and thinking who was educated&nbsp;
what what did anybody really learn you know I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.320
can go on LBC and have a fight with Nick Ferrari&nbsp;
you know what I mean but ultimately what do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.360
learn as a listener all we do is just we just put&nbsp;
poison into it you know what I mean what I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.760
to do is to educate ordinary working people all&nbsp;
the new people in ordinary Financial situations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.780
that I think that ultimately of course only that&nbsp;
is going to lead us to a positive outcome so when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.580
we talk about educating and backtracking ever so&nbsp;
slightly towards the start of the conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:50.580
so a couple things you're saying that you want&nbsp;
people to to demand the change yeah who are they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.040
demanding it from I know you did talk about the&nbsp;
think tanks and politicians and certain things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.140
going into place who are they actually demanding&nbsp;
it from how feasible are these demands yeah and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.020
if they're making these demands yeah then you know&nbsp;
there has to be some give elsewhere whether that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.180
affects you know the super wealthy or whatnot&nbsp;
whether they they notice that that difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.060
like it's obviously going to have to give&nbsp;
somewhere else and will it effectively mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.120
that it could affect you know other services&nbsp;
that are available would they kind of take from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.800
them like they have been or or they currently&nbsp;
do I don't think they're going to turn around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.080
and take for you because you made demands um I&nbsp;
think you know we do still live in a democracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.760
right and I think what you see I think brexit&nbsp;
is a good example right when brexit came around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.080
when they're when the referendum came around&nbsp;
both the two major parties you know we live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.640
a two-part system we're very anti-brexit and they&nbsp;
push they lost the referendum and they were still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.260
anti-brexit but eventually people demand enough&nbsp;
people demanded it and enough people ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.420
said we're only going to vote based on brexit&nbsp;
that both parties essentially had to come around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:04.080
um I think that tax in the rich will be a harder&nbsp;
fight than brexit because I think a lot of rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.460
people don't really care that much about brexit&nbsp;
because they didn't really hit them um whereas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.580
tax in the rich they'll be bigger pushback um but&nbsp;
I think voting is important you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.900
and I know a lot of people don't like to hear that&nbsp;
but it is important and it's it's not even about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.740
I spoke about this bit in the last video it's not&nbsp;
even about conservatives or labor it's about being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.380
it's a you know these guys are always doing&nbsp;
polling they're always asking people what do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.800
you want what do you want what do you want I want&nbsp;
these guys to do a poll group and have everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.360
say to them I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unless you fix&nbsp;
what's inequality I want this to be the message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.520
coming out the polling groups and that comes I&nbsp;
think actually people have a lot more power than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.740
they actually think and not as individuals but&nbsp;
as the the conversation that we have as a group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:52.140
you know if everybody turns around and says&nbsp;
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these guys we want brexit then they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.680
get it and if everybody turns around and says&nbsp;
listen these guys are just a bunch of crooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.220
they're not doing anything unless they fix wealth&nbsp;
inequality with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and if that is the message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.720
coming out from you know I want people phoning&nbsp;
into LBC saying that I tell you this is a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.800
story right and I can't mention any names right&nbsp;
but recently I've been getting contacted by a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.020
of politicians right and I was in a room with&nbsp;
politicians okay and a conservative politician&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.660
puts her hand up and says that money that 450&nbsp;
billion pounds given that in covert who's got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.440
it now well and there was people in that room&nbsp;
looking at turning and looking at me because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.740
they know I've been pushing that line they are&nbsp;
from day after day after day and it's just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.520
realization that she's just met or that person&nbsp;
this politician didn't hear it from me but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.660
heard it from someone and ultimately that person&nbsp;
would heard it from someone who would have heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.080
it from someone who probably would have heard it&nbsp;
from me and that is because of the conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.180
that we have as a group like this is not I run a&nbsp;
YouTube channel and everybody comes to me this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.660
I run a YouTube channel and you start asking&nbsp;
this question to your mates and people start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.200
calling into LBC and people start posting on their&nbsp;
Twitter people start posting on their Facebook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:59.580
like ultimately the conversation that we have as&nbsp;
a society has the power to push these politicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.380
you know and if enough if it becomes generally&nbsp;
accepted that listen the only way we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.820
fix this is wealth inequality the politicians will&nbsp;
have to do it and don't get me wrong it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.620
a fight but the thing is at the moment we are not&nbsp;
there yet but it's like that you know you get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.700
message out I tell you you tell your mates you&nbsp;
know your mates come and watch this Channel and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.960
then they start they people start using their&nbsp;
own media channels you know what I mean it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:28.260
it's an echo chamber and it's like everybody&nbsp;
has a voice and it's like okay not everybody has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.540
a YouTube channel but you you have your mates at&nbsp;
football your mate to the pub you have your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.280
you know what I mean you have the people at work&nbsp;
you can influence this conversation you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.880
I mean and you know I would encourage people put&nbsp;
the phone in to talk radio and LBC and whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.900
whatever the news programs are phone in get it&nbsp;
out put it on your Twitter put it on your Facebook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:51.600
tell your mates tell your friends or your family&nbsp;
and then eventually I here get politicians coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.440
back to me quoting the lines what I am saying&nbsp;
but they didn't hear it from me it's because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.640
it's because we are a community and&nbsp;
we are a society and and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.920
you have a power to influence the beliefs&nbsp;
of the people in your life you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.480
mean yeah and it's you you share it and&nbsp;
I share and then eventually it becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.760
it becomes common sense and the politicians have&nbsp;
to do it you know and but don't get me wrong we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.300
will get pushback and you know we're not at that&nbsp;
stage here because we're not at that level yet you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.560
know there are still people who disagree with&nbsp;
these ideas but we need to get it you know not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.780
just me but you and the people who are watching&nbsp;
you know and I will do as much as I can but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.380
will only work you know it's not going to work&nbsp;
because everyone in the country subscribes to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.800
YouTube channel you know what I mean it's going&nbsp;
to work because enough people subscribe to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.000
YouTube channel and they tell their friends and&nbsp;
then they tell and they tell their friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.220
you know everybody shares the voice you know it's&nbsp;
that's that's how it works you know I did spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:50.640
for a community it's not like it's not one person&nbsp;
it's a it's a is a combination of many one people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:58.380
working together you know is is your plants kind&nbsp;
of like address this globally because inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.360
exists everywhere and anywhere I would love&nbsp;
for it to be Global and you know I do as and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.840
where I can try and build up International links&nbsp;
it's very important for people to realize that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:13.260
this problem is not a UK only problem this&nbsp;
is happening everywhere um I'm aware that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.680
I my voice is much louder in the UK than&nbsp;
it is around the world and also like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.980
you know people are just more amenable to a&nbsp;
mess like I understand what's happening here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.900
you know and people hear me and they know this&nbsp;
guy is from here you know what I mean yeah you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.220
know I get people from all over the country&nbsp;
I think a big thing is like in the UK there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.720
not a lot of like regular working-class voices&nbsp;
especially talking about economics on TV on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.520
radio so like you don't need to be from London I&nbsp;
get messages from people from Scotland or people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.080
from the northwest or people from Wales or people&nbsp;
from the Midlands all over saying like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.080
they watch the video in ilford and they're&nbsp;
like I grew up just like you you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.420
mean so I know that like in the reality like&nbsp;
I have a lot more power to make a voice hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.120
and that is what I'm focusing on but you know&nbsp;
when the book comes out it's going to come out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.000
in America and it's going to kind of come out&nbsp;
all over the world you know what I mean and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.280
if you look at the like the one big time in&nbsp;
history when we did achieve a big decrease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.900
in inequality which is after the second world war&nbsp;
it was very much an international thing okay and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:22.140
um I think that success will be a lot easier&nbsp;
if we can have people saying that these kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.500
of things you know like I say we're a&nbsp;
community in the end of the day you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.920
we're not just a national Community these things&nbsp;
are happening everywhere you know and if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.780
if you do have connections in other countries talk&nbsp;
to them and they will tell you you know you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.900
there are countries that have a lot worse&nbsp;
inequality than here and there are countries that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.200
have less than here but inequality is increasing&nbsp;
everywhere and the same problems can't afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.980
housing can't get a decent job you know worried&nbsp;
about being able to have a family these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:51.060
happening everywhere so do these things cycle&nbsp;
so does it get worse and then get a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:58.140
better and then get worse um yeah they do but you&nbsp;
know if we use like history as a guide you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.000
things got really bad before they got better&nbsp;
you know the last you know you know we had the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.960
first world war and that didn't really fix things&nbsp;
things got worse after that and you know you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.380
you don't need me to tell you what happened after&nbsp;
the first world war you know I mean we had whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.460
countries brought into fascism we had the Nazis&nbsp;
we had the Holocaust where the Second World War&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.760
and you know only then after that did we get a&nbsp;
reduction in equality and a good sign of living so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:27.480
yes things cycle but things cycle because we make&nbsp;
it happen you know I mean it's not like a natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.620
thing it's not like the sun goes down the sun&nbsp;
will come up there's some will only come up if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.360
we make no one is going to turn around and give&nbsp;
us this this increase in living standards and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.220
decreasing inequality that is only going to come&nbsp;
from us fighting for it and us making it happen

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:53.100
yeah but I guess it kind of goes back to&nbsp;
where do you kind of Target your fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:00.120
who who am I to fight like if I haven't&nbsp;
even got enough time or money to get on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.240
with my day-to-day why am I going to waste&nbsp;
time in this fight that is not necessarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.440
gonna happen and then that's me exerting my time&nbsp;
wasting my time wasting my energy trying to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.940
don't get me wrong I fully understand what you're&nbsp;
saying there has to be someone out there to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.380
a change it takes people to make this change&nbsp;
yeah but I just feel there's a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.800
that will just be like and I'm not talking&nbsp;
for anyone in particular I maybe maybe have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.240
it in my mindset where I'm kind of like you&nbsp;
know I've just got to do what I've got to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:41.340
do you know I I do what I do and then I go to&nbsp;
sleep yeah like anything that can can happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:49.020
within that is a bonus but yeah realistically&nbsp;
how much time and effort can I put into this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.360
but what do I need to put into this the way I&nbsp;
see it and the way I approach it myself for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:04.320
I see it as I take what I need and I give what&nbsp;
I can and like I'm 100 aware I'm in a situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.320
where it is much much easier for me to give a lot&nbsp;
than it is for a lot of people you know I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.540
doing this work unpaid for years of course not&nbsp;
hardly anyone can do that you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.160
yeah um and not only that you know I've got this&nbsp;
background of studying this stuff for years I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.760
not going to expect you to turn around and be an&nbsp;
expert on this stuff and make a website about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:30.720
you know what I mean yeah um and I'm also aware&nbsp;
that there is this problem of first of all like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.500
this YouTube is open to everyone but really&nbsp;
who is fought in my mind is the people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.980
see the economics on the news and think what the&nbsp;
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about I don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.640
we're talking about and and people who are worried&nbsp;
it's the people who are getting hurt and not being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.380
spoken to you know because I feel they need to be&nbsp;
a space for just ordinary people you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:55.980
mean um and I'm aware that increasingly people in&nbsp;
the average financial situation is increasingly a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.100
struggle so I'm aware that people I'm speaking&nbsp;
to very often you know don't have a lot to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.880
and you know I'm not asking for money I wouldn't&nbsp;
expect money but often they also don't have time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.840
and energy because they're just struggling to take&nbsp;
up their families in this and I would never turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.040
around to anyone I would never turn around to&nbsp;
you and say bro you need to help me with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.520
you know what I mean like you're here today you&nbsp;
know because you have a bit of time to come right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.000
but we're never talking about if you if you say to&nbsp;
me like I can't because I'm working I can't I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.240
got to do this for my for my family I would never&nbsp;
say you have to um I would leave you totally like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.780
in the power and the decision of the people who&nbsp;
watch but I know I know like from the I've seen it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.460
that the people who have little are&nbsp;
still in many cases willing and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:44.160
want to help you know I went up to Richardson's&nbsp;
constituency in North Yorkshire to a food bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.060
um so I feel like to speak to people about like&nbsp;
do you know how rich vicious and the cost of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.500
living crisis and just coincidentally&nbsp;
it happened to be immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.440
the invasion of Ukraine so I'm going up this food&nbsp;
bank in North Yorkshire right and it's you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.960
oh everyone in there just packing stuff&nbsp;
everyone is in volunteers packing stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.900
and then four guys are gonna drive put it in&nbsp;
lorries they're lorries and drive to Ukraine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:20.220
and um I asked the people like who are these&nbsp;
people here and it was the food bank users&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.960
so these are the people that don't even have&nbsp;
enough to eat and yet you see this thing happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.060
like a thousand miles away and you are going&nbsp;
to go and do that and I think that is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.520
I've seen that in my life like I know that&nbsp;
people don't much but they are willing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.080
I wouldn't ask anyone to give more than&nbsp;
they can give yeah it's just like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.580
just like if all you can do is watch the&nbsp;
videos and understand as best you can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.580
do that and even if you can't watch&nbsp;
other videos don't do that but like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.760
just tell your friends to your family look try&nbsp;
to understand what's happening just say listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.980
there's a guy I think he knows what he's talking&nbsp;
about he says the only way to fix this is to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.080
wealth inequality you know it seems like he&nbsp;
knows his stuff check him out you know he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.880
just and then it's what can you and like there&nbsp;
will be things that you can do that I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.380
even think about people ask me what can I&nbsp;
do what can I do the truth is I do I make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.680
a YouTube channel I'm talking about economics&nbsp;
because I know economics you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.120
yeah but as an ordinary person you know I'm not&nbsp;
you know I've lived in Japan and I've lived in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.420
Oxford and I've been all over right I'm not&nbsp;
really as connected to the local community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.080
but there will be a lot of people who what they&nbsp;
just have is you know there will be guys around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.440
here watch my videos and then they just got&nbsp;
the Masjid you know what I mean tell the guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.680
at mustard you know I mean I don't know those&nbsp;
guys you tell it you know what I mean like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.180
and there'll be people who like you know there'll&nbsp;
be people who are created you know what I mean who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.460
who know who can make other ways of communicating&nbsp;
these ideas I think what it is about is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.920
you don't need to do anything you know what I&nbsp;
mean and I would never demand it from anyone but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.560
look at your situation and say what can I do and&nbsp;
it's if it's just something that's like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.600
you know if everybody tells one other person&nbsp;
then you get everyone that's what it takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:06.840
you know what I mean just try and understand&nbsp;
it and try and communicate these ideas with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.380
with the people around you and just get&nbsp;
into the conversation it's like that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.320
that's who I would ask and you know I get messages&nbsp;
so many messages for people I want to help I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.600
to help and I find it difficult because I can't&nbsp;
I would love to reply to all of them yeah like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:30.480
just it's enough to just spread the message he&nbsp;
said it's enough to understand it to recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.000
that it is good and that is important and to&nbsp;
spread it like that is ultimately if everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.500
supports it what happened so really all you need&nbsp;
to do is to support it you know and if you can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.660
more fantastic but like and if you're in a space&nbsp;
where literally you are struggling to pay the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.160
bills then do that you know what I mean I wouldn't&nbsp;
ask for anything more it's a question of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.640
how much time and energy do you have and I know&nbsp;
because I've seen it that people are struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.880
still want to help I've seen it enough times&nbsp;
yeah definitely oh that sky looks amazing

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.880
money currently is Flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.020
government with big powers of debt and the&nbsp;
rich would be part of money there's one other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.860
thing they can do with that mass amount&nbsp;
of income they can buy your mom's house

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.360
