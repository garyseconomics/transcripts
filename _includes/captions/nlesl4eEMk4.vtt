00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually weak. And I came to this
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
actually weak. And I came to this

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
The rich are accumulating it. And I
 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.590 align:start position:0%
The rich are accumulating it. And I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
realized straight away that's going to
 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
realized straight away that's going to
get<00:00:49.760><c> worse</c><00:00:50.000><c> forever.</c><00:00:50.719><c> And</c><00:00:50.879><c> that</c><00:00:51.039><c> that</c><00:00:51.280><c> was</c><00:00:51.440><c> how</c>

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
get worse forever. And that that was how
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
get worse forever. And that that was how
I<00:00:51.680><c> made</c><00:00:51.840><c> my</c><00:00:52.000><c> big</c><00:00:52.160><c> money.</c><00:00:52.480><c> Basically,</c><00:00:52.879><c> I</c>

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
I made my big money. Basically, I
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.470 align:start position:0%
I made my big money. Basically, I
realized<00:00:53.360><c> in</c><00:00:53.680><c> 2011</c><00:00:54.879><c> that</c><00:00:55.199><c> the</c><00:00:55.440><c> economy</c><00:00:56.160><c> for</c><00:00:56.480><c> at</c>

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
realized in 2011 that the economy for at
 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.389 align:start position:0%
realized in 2011 that the economy for at
least<00:00:56.800><c> for</c><00:00:56.960><c> ordinary</c><00:00:57.440><c> people</c><00:00:57.920><c> would</c><00:00:58.239><c> get</c>

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
least for ordinary people would get
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
least for ordinary people would get
worse<00:00:58.879><c> forever.</c>
