00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Okay.

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.920
Today, we are going to ask the

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.840
question, can Labour be saved?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.480
Okay, so this is the first ever part

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.680
two of a two-part video this week.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.160
So last week, we discussed the question of

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.080
whether Labour have been unlucky and whether

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.960
global center-left political parties have been

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.520
unlucky, and that is why they were very unpopular.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.240
And the conclusion that I came to is they're not

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.080
unlucky in the way that they like to say they are.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.120
They like to say they have inherited bad

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.920
economies from the right, from the center-right,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.760
and that's nothing to do with them.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.320
In reality, the weakening economies were

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.640
predictable long before Labour came into power.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.000
I've been predicting them for five years.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.920
I tried my best to let Labour know before they

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.760
came into power that there was going to be big problems

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.400
of government spending, government funding, big

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720
problems with inequality, and they ignored it.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.320
So they are not unlucky in the sense that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.880
the economic problems were unpredictable.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.280
But where they are unlucky is that the economic

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.440
problems that Labour are facing and the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.080
UK economy is facing is not at all unique.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.480
This problem of weakening economy, falling

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.080
living standards, has basically been experienced by

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.640
every government in the UK for the last 15 years.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.040
It brought down Rishi Sunak for the same reason

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.960
that it would... that it's bringing down Keir Starmer.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.760
It will bring down Nigel Farage

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.280
if and when he comes into power.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720
The same thing is happening to Donald Trump in America.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.880
The same thing is happening to the German

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.040
government, the French government, the Spanish

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.880
government, the Italian government, even the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.200
Japanese government, the Australian Government.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.480
This is happening to governments all over the world.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.320
It's not a Labour-specific problem.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.280
And what this is, really, is more of a broad

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.120
intellectual failing where our economists

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.480
and our politicians are simply unable to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.920
recognise that we have a structural growing

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.960
problem of growing wealth inequality, and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.240
that is the cause of the economic crisis.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.640
Okay, so once we accept that, that what we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.400
have is a broad intellectual failing,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.040
that raises the question of, what do we do?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.600
We're in a situation here where

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.440
inequality continues to rise.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.560
That means that living standards will continue to fall.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.880
It's important that we recognise that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.440
that is like, really, really serious.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.320
That means people not being able to heat

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.920
their homes, feed their kids, buy houses,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.240
have families, have financial security.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.720
It's going to be really, really serious

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.920
here and across the world.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280
So we need to ask ourselves, what can we do?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.440
How can we get governments to change

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.000
policy to stop inequality from rising?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.760
Which basically means policy on taxation, wealth taxes.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.840
And here in this country, and I think in most countries,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.200
you basically have two choices, assuming you don't

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.880
get anything on inequality and taxation from the right

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.440
and the center-right, which I think is probably true.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.560
You have to either build a new political party

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.040
or try and influence your centre-left parties.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.840
Here in this country, under our first-past-the-post

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.640
political system, which I think is a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.920
bit of a stupid system, it is very, very

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.760
difficult to displace political parties.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.400
So we need to figure out, can we save Labour?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.040
So that raises the big two questions of this video.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.800
Why have Labour failed to recognise inequality as

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280
the core central message, and can they be saved?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.720
Okay, so, you know, I speak

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.920
about why they've failed a lot.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.880
I spoke about it a lot in last week's video.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.720
This is a misdiagnosis of an economic problem.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.000
Economists don't look at inequality a lot.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.320
We have a crisis of falling living standards

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.520
being caused by growing inequality, and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.120
economists are missing it, and that's causing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.720
political parties, including Labour, to miss it.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.840
Why that is happening, I think...

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.160
To be honest, I'm not 100% sure.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.400
I've got a lot of theories.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.440
And We're going to run through them.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.240
It's important that we understand why

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.360
these guys are missing it if we want

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.000
to move into a more sensible position.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.920
A big part of this, in my opinion, is coming from

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.920
problems in the academic discipline of economics.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.360
So economics in the way that it is

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680
understood and taught at universities.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.120
I've spoken about this in some past videos.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.120
Maybe we'll flash a link up to 'Why economists are

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.720
always wrong' which is a cool video of me walking around

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.480
Oxford years ago when we used to do things like that.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.960
When you study economics at university

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.040
nowadays, it is a very complicated and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.480
difficult and extremely mathematical subject.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.760
You spend an enormous amount of time doing

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.640
complicated algebra, complicated calculus.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.920
If you take it to post-grad or PhD or post-doc level,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.400
you are going to spend 10 years doing complicated calculus

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.440
and algebra on very, very mathematically complicated

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.760
models, almost all of which contain no inequality.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.040
This is a very, very effective way

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.280
of training economists not to think

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.080
about the economy in terms of inequality.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.920
If you have spent 10 years locked in stuffy,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.240
windowless university library rooms doing simultaneous

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.360
equations and complicated algebra and calculus, when

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.360
you see a real-world economic problem, you are going to

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.640
have a very strong temptation to try to apply the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.160
things you learnt and things you studied at university.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.360
If you spent 10 years studying very, very complicated

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.240
mathematical models that include no inequality,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.760
you are very, very unlikely to look at an economic

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.400
problem and think, "Maybe this is being caused by

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.760
inequality." I think there's also a kind of

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.360
hothouse, very competitive culture within economics

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.000
specifically, although I do think it's happening in

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.680
lot of academic disciplines, which really, really

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.200
aggressively rewards students for studying and

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.280
writing papers on kind of fashionable ideas and not

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.280
really stepping outside the box and writing about

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.440
things which are unfashionable, like inequality.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440
You know, a good example of this is Ha-Joon Chang,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.160
who is a Korean economics professor who I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.640
think is really smart guy, really thoughtful.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.640
I've got a lot of time for him.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.440
We had him on the channel earlier this year.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.680
He writes a lot of great books about things like

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.160
how Korea went from being poor to being rich.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.600
He has a lot of things to say about how

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.640
countries can improve living standards.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.160
And yet, because he does not talk and write

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.400
in the way which is approved within economics,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.600
despite the fact that he is the best-selling

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.280
economics author in the entire country, he is

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.520
largely shunned and ignored within economics.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.120
Another great example is Thomas Piketty. French

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.000
economist who had a very prestigious, illustrious,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.680
successful economics career, who decided in 2011, "I'm

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080
going to start talking about inequality." Probably because

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.280
he was smart enough to recognise what a big deal it was.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.120
And since then has been kind of criticised,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.760
attacked, shunned, and sidelined a

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.240
lot within the economics community.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.280
So, within economics as a whole, you have a

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.280
discipline which is not able really to look or

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.480
think in terms of inequality, and tends to

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.160
punish people who think outside the box, who

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.000
are willing to think in different terms.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.720
I think COVID is a great example of this.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.320
We had the crisis, which from the very

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.920
beginning it should have been obvious was going

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.640
to cause a massive increase in inequality.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.760
And yet basically nobody in academia, in the think

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.000
thanks, the central banks, which are kind of extensions

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.880
of academia, was ever able or willing to think about it

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.640
in terms of inequality, in terms of distribution.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.920
You then have the additional factor that

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.480
specifically within economics you have this other

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.120
optional career path, which aggressively

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.520
rewards people who think outside the box and

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.120
challenge conventional wisdom, which is trading.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.200
So, I have studied at the London

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.960
School of Economics and at Oxford.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.360
I can tell you with a very high level of

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.680
confidence the vast majority of economics undergrads

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.440
really, really want to work in finance jobs like trading

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.520
or perhaps other jobs nowadays, like tech or AI.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.280
They're not trying to get into government.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.800
But they know that in trading, trading is quite

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.160
interesting in that it really, really heavily rewards

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
people who turn around and say, "Everyone around me

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.560
is wrong" as long as you get proved to be right.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.400
When I was a trader, I was a very heavily

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.120
counter-trend trader, so I liked to really bet

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.400
aggressively on things that everybody thought was wrong.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.920
And if you do that, you get paid a lot of money.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.040
So, you have one side of economics, which is the kind

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.480
of public-facing side, which is the universities, the

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.240
governments, the think tanks, which really, really

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.760
punishes people for stepping outside the sort of

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.760
acceptable box and saying, "I think everybody is wrong.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.520
I think something different." And then you have

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.360
another much better-paid side of economics, which

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.960
really, really aggressively rewards people who do that.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.640
So obviously, if you are the kind of person who

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.080
wants to challenge conventional wisdom in economics,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.120
there are very, very strong reasons why you might try

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.880
and go into finance and trading rather than economics.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.360
But even if we accept this that economics as a

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.720
discipline kind of slightly brainwashes its students

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.880
into not really breaking the rules and then really

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.240
pushes the students who are a little bit more inventive

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.080
in their thinking out of academia and into trading,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.760
we're now in a situation where in the last 17 years,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.880
living standards have been falling quite consistently.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.200
Existing political parties have

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.520
been losing again and again.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.760
They've been consistently failing on the economy.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.360
The far-right is growing all across the world.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.360
There's this outrage against popular economists,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.440
popular politicians, against the status quo.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.040
It's like really obvious that

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.480
the status quo is failing.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.760
We have in the Labour Party a government

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.320
that is phenomenally unpopular, looks

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.400
very likely to lose the next election, is

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.920
desperately in need of money and new ideas.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.840
And yet despite this, like, very long-term track record

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.040
of quite consistent failure, this really powerful

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.200
demand for new ideas from the public, economists and

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.480
politicians have still been really, really stubbornly

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.920
ignoring and, and unwilling to talk to people like me.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.800
And it's not just me.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.560
We have other people like Thomas Piketty...

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.640
Gabriel Zucman in France saying similar

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.240
things and meeting really strong pushback, even

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.680
from politicians who are supposed to be on the

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.880
left, who you might imagine would be more open to ideas

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.720
like taxing very rich people, reducing inequality.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.680
So, why is it that economists and politicians have

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.520
been so stubborn in ignoring these ideas about

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.560
inequality in spite of the massive popular demand?

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.440
Now this, to be honest, is something which

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.440
I'm not 100% certain on, and it's something,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.280
which I think about a lot, because obviously

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.080
we're at a point now on this channel where

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.040
we've had a huge amount of cut through with the public.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.400
And what we are kind of coming up against is

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
we're hitting this wall of politicians

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.480
and academics and kind of this intellectual

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.800
middle class who are refusing to accept it.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.680
And if we want to actually get this into power, we

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.560
do need to try to understand why these guys are so

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.960
unwilling to listen to us, so unwilling to work with us.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960
So, I've been thinking about this a lot,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.240
speaking to a few different people and

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.560
we're trying to understand what it is.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.720
And I've got a list of ideas here, which might

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.480
be what is stopping them from listening to us.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.320
I'm going to go through them and you can

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.240
let me know if you think any of these are

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.760
right, if you think any of these are wrong.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.640
If you think there's anything

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.240
I'm missing, put it in the comments.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.080
But I'll go through the list of ideas I've got here.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.680
So, number one is, I've

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.320
got here the far-left theory.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.360
And this is that me and my ideas have kind of

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.720
been branded in the eyes of the political class,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.560
the politicians, maybe the media as far left.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.360
And a lot of politicians don't like the

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.720
far left, and they are unwilling to

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.400
countenance anything that is branded as far left.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.400
This is very frustrating for me because

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.720
I don't come from a political background.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.080
I don't come from the far left.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.200
My background is I studied economics at LSE.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.480
I was very successful.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.640
I got very good grades.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.040
I went on to become a trader.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.280
I was very successful and made

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.720
a lot of very good predictions.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040
I went to Oxford to do a two-year master's.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.400
Again, I did very well.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.000
Classic, classically trained economist.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.960
And then I've been out here speaking publicly,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.240
making very good predictions as well.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.040
Like for me, I have never tried to be far left.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.960
I don't come from a political background.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.240
I have a very, very good track

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.640
record of being right.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.000
And this is the kind of thing which

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.640
gets you a long way in the financial world.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.480
People will look a lot at what your

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.520
track record of predictions are like.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.840
If you don't believe my track record of

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.560
predictions, go and watch the video from...

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.760
first ever video from this channel in June 2020.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.720
You'll see how good the predictions

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.920
were just at the beginning.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.800
But it does seem like this might be one of

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.200
the reasons why Labour are not listening

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.600
to us, that they think we're far left.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.840
We need to think about how can we

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.360
try to rid ourselves of that brand.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.840
Honestly, you know, I

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.240
don't... I'm an economist.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.440
I don't think of economics

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.000
as left or right, you know.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.640
When I look at the economy... When I first

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.480
started making these bets in 2011 as a trader,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.800
because I was heavily financially incentivised to

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.440
bet on what's right. I've been betting

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.400
on these things since the beginning of COVID.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.800
I've made a huge amount of money.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.720
I don't say these things because

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.640
I have some political motive.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.560
I say these things because I have a very

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.200
good track record of accurate predictions.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.960
My current forecasts are for

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.360
a collapse in living standards.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.400
I don't want living standards to collapse even further.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.160
But unfortunately, this, this branding as far-left is

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.400
perhaps one of the things which is about stopping us.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.920
I've got here the Zach Polanski theory.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.440
I went on a podcast with Zach Polanski,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.880
the new leader of the Greens.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.600
I asked him, why is there so much resistance?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.760
And he just basically said, like, they're all bought.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.960
He goes, "This is it. Like, they're all

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.800
bought, they're paid for by the rich.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.320
Their donors are very, very rich.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.040
They go and work for rich people."

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.840
Which some people might say is quite conspiratorial

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.240
and quite negative but I think there

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.760
might be some element of this involved.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.560
You know, when we were looking at the Conservative

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.920
Party, we had Rishi Sunak, who was phenomenally wealthy.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.680
We had David Cameron, who went on to make a

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.600
huge amount of money after leaving office.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.520
Before that, Tony Blair made a huge

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.040
amount of money after leaving office.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.360
I don't know what Keir Starmer's plans are, but it

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.160
does seem that part of the problem may simply be

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.800
the political class, especially at the top level, is

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.360
people who are very rich or are about to become

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.160
very rich and are often funded by the very rich.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.240
That could be an element.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.520
That could be an element to it.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.280
If that happens, that will be tricky.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.320
We have to think about how we can work around it.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.800
Okay, I've got here the class theory.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.360
This is the theory that basically the kind

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.400
of intellectual class... I wanted to...

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.280
Thomas Piketty, the French inequality

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.200
economist, calls them the Brahmin class.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.960
So he uses the term the Brahmin class, which refers

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.200
to... The Brahmins were the top caste in the Indian

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.960
caste system, and they're basically priests, and

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960
uses this term to talk about this kind of, this

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.440
kind of group of intellectuals who... High-level

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.560
economists, high-level academics, high-level

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.080
journalists, high-level politics, media, high-level

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.120
perhaps business, who sort of determine what

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.600
the public think and control a lot of the media.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.560
I've had this theory for a while.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.640
And when I first started this channel, it was... I

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.280
didn't know at the time it would become as big as it

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.120
has done, but a big part of it was I felt that there

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.360
wasn't really any sort of economic news source that felt

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.120
just accessible or understandable to ordinary people.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.120
And I was writing for the Guardian at the time

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.840
and I really thought because I come from a working-class

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.000
background, and I look and I sound working class,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.440
I thought ordinary people would appreciate having

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.840
somebody from an ordinary background talking to them

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.520
about economics in a way that they could understand.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.520
And that was a big part of the idea of this channel.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.760
And that means that really ever since the beginning,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.160
I've always been trying to talk to the public

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.200
rather than trying to talk to the politicians.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.080
And I'm obviously English and this is a country which

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.640
has had a long history of a class system, and

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.880
I do think there is a problem that when especially

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.600
more middle-class people see or hear somebody from a

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.240
working-class background, they perhaps make assumptions

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.840
that this guy is maybe not smart or maybe not honest.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.840
And I do think that sometimes is

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.720
one of the reasons why I'm not taken that

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.600
seriously by these senior Labour politicians.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.520
Again, it's very, very frustrating because, you

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.520
know, I was a very successful, very well-paid

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.320
trader and I was taken very seriously in that space.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.000
And it's very frustrating to not be taken

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.920
seriously by people who would very, probably

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.600
very happily give me their money to manage.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.240
I think a great example of this is when

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.240
I went on The Rest Is Politics, which is,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.200
for those who are not in the UK, the most

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.640
popular politics podcast here in the UK.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.360
It has a couple of presenters, one of whom is from a,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.080
a very posh, you might even say aristocratic background.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.800
And I made this case to him

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.520
that I felt like one of the reasons why

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.920
I'm not taken seriously by politicians is because

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.640
I'm from a working-class background and because

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.760
of how I talk and because of how I sound.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.760
And he replied, "You know, I don't think that's right.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.680
You shouldn't patronise politicians.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.520
I think it's because of your class anger."

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.080
Which is, Well, it's a wonderful thing

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.040
to say really, because it's... What he's saying is

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.120
it's because of my class and the way that I speak,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.960
which is, which is exactly what I what I said,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.960
in a way, so... I put the case to him that posh

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.680
people don't take me seriously because of my class

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.560
and how I speak, and he said, "No, it's not that.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.520
It's because of your class and how

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.480
you speak." I do think it's a problem.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.360
I think the way that we get around this is really

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.680
I need yourselves and people like you to try as

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.080
much as you can to infiltrate those elite spaces.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.640
So, get yourselves and your kids into fancy

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.880
universities, fancy jobs, media, politics, academia,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.320
banks, finance, civil service, central banking,

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.920
and get those ideas that way.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.400
I would never tell anyone to change the way you

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.720
speak but we do need posh people with posh

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.800
voices, I think, to be taken seriously.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.680
The next one I've got here is the Gary is a dick theory.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.520
And this is basically the fact that, like, from the

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.520
beginning... So, I've made all my money basically

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.840
by betting on the fact that economists are wrong.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.120
And my whole career history

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.000
since 2011 is aggressively betting on

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.560
the fact that economists are wrong.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.080
And I do believe, I say it all the time,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.960
that I think we have a problem in economics where

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.120
economists are just failing to recognise this very,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.800
very serious problem of growing wealth inequality.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.720
And because of this, you know, sometimes

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.480
I... The way I speak about economists or

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.520
politicians or economists in

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
politics is perhaps a bit disrespectful.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.160
Last week's video on, on whether Labour

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.000
are unlucky or not was actually originally

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.320
scheduled to be called Why Are Labour So ****?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.120
And and this, I think kind of typifies, I think

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.240
a problem that I have, which is I'm very, very

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.360
frustrated with this political and economic class.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.840
And I spoke with Oscar, who's the manager of

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.640
this channel and he sort of talked me off the

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.560
cliff edge and said, "Listen, if you want Labour and

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.880
Labour politicians to listen to you, you can't be

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.920
saying Labour are ****." And the truth is, the

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.640
history of this channel has been quite a lot of me

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.360
sometimes in somewhat flamboyant ways saying that

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.960
I think economists and politicians are a bit dumb.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.320
And that perhaps worked very well in making this

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.720
channel very popular, but it's maybe not the

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.600
best way to get Labour to listen to you.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.800
And I've got here attached to this is that

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.280
Gary is a classist, which relates to the previous

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.800
issue that people don't like that the middle class,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.240
the sort of intellectual class don't listen to

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.200
me because I'm a working-class background.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.640
I think I do have accept that to a degree I am

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.560
frustrated and a little bit angry with this sort

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.600
of upper middle class, intellectual class that

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.320
are allowing the economy to fall off a cliff

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.280
while in many cases, they themselves get richer.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.440
This is probably best typified by a video

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.280
I did really, really early on called Elite Idiots,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.320
saying the economy is being ruined by rich idiots.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.640
The fact is, the way that I communicate,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.720
the way that I talk about economists and the

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.080
way that I talk about politicians is perhaps

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.200
a bit rude, and that has probably p***ed them off.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.320
And we need to think about that because yeah,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.640
we do need to figure out ways to speak to these guys.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.520
The last one I've got, which is about me personally,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.080
is the Gary style of approach theory, which is that

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.200
basically they don't respect me because I'm coming

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.560
up through YouTube, and they need you to be coming

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.280
up, you know, the sort of acceptable way you go

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.400
and you get your PhD and you work your way through.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.640
Just to be clear, I did go and do a

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.160
two-year master at Oxford before I started

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.920
doing this, and it was just so bad.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.440
The quality of education was just unbelievably bad.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.920
I felt guilty for having paid for such a poor education.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.360
And I could also see, you know, the economy

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.680
was going to get worse quickly, and I didn't

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.280
think I wanted to do another six, seven years

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.120
wasting my time getting locked in libraries.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.560
But this is the truth, right?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.240
You know, I think the way that I've come through,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.640
through YouTube, through trading

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.680
being a bit rude about posh people was

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.920
never going to endear me to posh people.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.280
So we do need other people to go in,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.240
push these theories, push this understanding,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.040
not using my face, not using my name.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.320
It helps if you got a posh voice.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.400
Just don't talk about me.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.920
Take the ideas, take the ideas and run with them.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.400
But, you know, criticisms of these last

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.880
ones, all of these ideas are sort of based

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.440
on Gary specifically is doing it wrong.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.840
The thing is, we've got another guy.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.200
There's a guy called Gabriel Zucman, French economist,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.480
who is doing great work pushing for wealth taxes in

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.520
France, and he's come at it a very different way,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.800
very academic, got his PhD, very prestigious academic.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.240
You know, didn't go through trading, didn't go

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.440
through YouTube, went direct to the politicians

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.120
and he's doing a really, really good job and we

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.480
hope he gets it, but he is also getting pushback.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.520
And if the problem was just specifically me,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.560
then you would imagine that other people in other

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.520
countries would be doing a better job of wealth taxes.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.680
So I'm not really sure whether these

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.760
ideas that focus very much on me are the real answer.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.800
I've got a couple more ideas here.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.640
One is the small C conservatism theory,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.200
which is basically just that because this

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.520
Brahmin class, this intellectual class is largely

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.640
richer people from richer backgrounds getting paid

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.920
quite well, they are just very comfortable with the

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.920
status quo and they don't want things to change.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.640
They don't like ideas about taxation

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.000
because they see themselves as rich.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.560
They don't want to pay higher taxes.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.400
Next is the big picture thinkers

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.280
are all in different jobs theory, which is basically

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.280
what I said before, which is, if you are the kind

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.440
of person that wants to challenge the status quo,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.120
think strategically, you are going to get rewarded much

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.640
better generally in business or in finance or in

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.800
trading than you will do in places like politics.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.040
You do see a few... Well, the most obvious

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.760
counter-example to that is Dominic Cummings, who was

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.920
a kind of very radical guy, who became very senior in

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.520
government here before being publicly defenestrated,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.120
Which means thrown out of a window.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.080
Not literally.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.760
And the last one here is the social mobility theory,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.480
which is basically that, you know, I think back

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.960
in the day, this country, with young kids like

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.520
me, it would often, like very smart young kids

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.080
from poor backgrounds, would send them to grammar

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.160
school and they would bring them into places

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.360
like the civil service or like in government.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.680
And you did have a situation where a lot

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.520
of the smartest young kids ended up in

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.640
some sense or another running the country.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.360
Great example of this is John Major, who

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.160
was the prime minister in the early '90s, who I

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.040
believe came from a very working-class family.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.040
I think his dad was a clown or something, wasn't it?

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.880
Something like that.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.160
Worked in the circus, I think.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.640
But went to a grammar school

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.520
and ended up running the country.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.520
And I think if you look at countries like China

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.520
or like Singapore, they do still make sure that

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.600
a lot of the smartest kids in their country or,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.240
you know, the kids that do best in exams, end up

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.080
working in government, end up running the country.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.760
So what you see is, in the UK in the past

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.320
and in countries like China and Singapore

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.000
now, they make sure that the best people, or

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.800
at least some of them, end up in government.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.600
Whereas now having been to sort of some

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.920
of the best universities in the country, I can

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.040
tell you the truth is not many of the smartest

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.720
kids aspire, especially from poorer backgrounds,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.520
aspire to work in government.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.360
Just simply because it is really, really

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.080
not a financially competitive job with

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.960
things like finance, with things like tech.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.240
And what that has led to, I think, is really

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.320
just basically not a lot of great people in

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.560
government really, and which I think is,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.080
is connected to the collapse of the country.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.240
But of course, I have to be careful about saying

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.680
things like that because as we've established, me

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.960
loudly saying that I think politicians are not very

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.880
competent is probably not the best way to win them over.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.840
So maybe forget that one.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.000
So I'm fascinated to understand why it is.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.840
I'm going to go on a bit of a break soon

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.480
and I'm going to really try to think about why.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.320
If you have ideas, let me know.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.640
But I think the theory which I think, I

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.720
think is most likely to be true, in my opinion, is

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.760
this last one, which is called the bubble theory.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.080
And this is just that basically as the economy has

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.400
become more divided, we have really divided the

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.800
lives of richer people, you know, the sort of

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.760
middle class, upper middle class, from the poor.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.840
And now we have this situation where

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.880
most elite jobs, including politics, have a

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.560
very high over-representation of people from

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.240
richer families, from private schools, from

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.880
this kind of elite, upper middle class space.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.080
There are still some working class people in

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.560
politics, but they're less likely to be at the

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.040
top and they are a minority in that group, which

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.560
means the overall culture of the space, elite

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.520
level, politics, media, banking, academia, all

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.640
of these spaces are very, very middle class.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.000
And what it means is you end up in a bit of a

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.120
bubble where most of the people in this space

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.440
went to elite schools, come from wealthy families,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.440
went to elite universities, end up in elite well-paid

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.440
jobs, and simply do not have a good understanding

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.520
of or connection to life for ordinary people.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.120
And I see this so often when I interact with people

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.280
from richer backgrounds and try to tell them what's

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.520
happening, this real unwillingness to even accept

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.640
that life is getting worse for ordinary people.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640
You see this all over the media.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.920
When I went on Rest is Politics, you had...

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.080
you had Rory Stewart saying, "I think,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.920
life is getting better in America." And then when

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.240
I went on LBC the other week, you had Tom Swarbrick

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.440
saying, "Oh, but things are okay in Australia."

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.640
Or we saw so much in the US press the last few years,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.120
this idea that the vibes are off, which is actually

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.800
life is getting better and it's the working

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.040
class just don't understand their own situation.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.560
Or there was the... the fantastic

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.840
piece by, was it John Burn-Murdoch?

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.440
Is that his name?

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.360
John Burn-Murdoch, the Financial Times journalist

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.560
saying, "Life is unambiguously getting better for

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.840
the poor." I think we have this problem now as

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.600
inequality is increasing and as social mobility is

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.040
decreasing, that when you go into elite spaces like

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.800
politics, they are really just full of wealthy people

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.760
who, because we exist in a crisis of inequality

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.320
where life is actually getting better for richer

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.720
people, they simply cannot see or understand

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.400
that life is getting worse for ordinary people.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.840
And I think probably this is the biggest problem

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.280
we have, the bubble theory, that the people who

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.440
are in charge of power are stuck in this bubble.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.520
Okay, so what do we do?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.440
How do we win them over even though

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.560
they're stuck in this bubble?

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.960
Well, actually, in a bizarre way, we have a great

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.080
opportunity here because these guys that have been

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.280
stuck in this bubble have been willing and able to

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.200
ignore us for a long time, but the reckoning is kind

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.800
of coming for them because unless they start taking

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.600
these ideas seriously, they will continue to fail

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.800
on the economy and they will lose to the far right.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.440
And I think a lot of these people, this intellectual

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.640
class, really do not want the far right to win.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.920
So we do have a really good opportunity here to

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.400
really keep banging the drum, really make sure these

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.840
people know if you don't move seriously on inequality

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.640
and the economy, you will lose to the far right.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.800
I think that that is a really good message to

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.640
have because that intellectual class specifically,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.960
that Brahmin class, I think a lot of them don't like

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.200
the far right, so we have a good opportunity here.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.000
But I have to be honest, I'm going to do

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.880
everything I can to win the next Labour leader.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.400
I think we will get a new Labour leader next year.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.360
I think probably we won't win them.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.880
If we don't, then that leader will fail on the economy

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.200
and Reform and Farage will win the next election.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.520
And they will fail on the economy

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.640
for the exact same reason.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.840
So, you know, I know this is not the best case scenario

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.880
because that would then mean nine years of no wealth

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.440
taxes, because I don't think we'll get anything

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.800
from Reform, but it will only strengthen our case.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.240
Yes, that might be a bit depressing, the idea that

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.160
if we don't get the next leader, we can't stop Reform

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.600
from winning and then it's nine years of no wealth tax.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.800
But don't lose hope entirely.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.400
I think there's a good chance that if Reform win

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.000
in four years, it could be a very small majority.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.880
It could be even a hung parliament, so a minority

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.800
government, that I think they would also become

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.480
very unpopular very quickly because it will be seen

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.280
that they're going to fail on the economy and there is

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.480
a good chance that that government will fall quickly.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.040
And it will strengthen our case even further.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.440
One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.520
is every single government you see in this

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.960
country or wherever you are for the next

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.480
20 years will do either one of two things.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.000
Either they will give us something serious

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.800
on inequality and taxation or they will

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.720
fail on the economy and living standards.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:05.080
So basically, we can only get stronger until we win.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080
So that's it, basically.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.280
We need to keep banging the drum again and again.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.000
We need to do everything we can do to de-radicalise

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.360
this brand, to de-leftise this brand, make it

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.200
clear that this is not about left or right; this

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.480
is about do you want the economy to fail or not?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.680
As much as we can, we need to separate the

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.080
brand from me as a person, which means I need

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.040
you guys to run with these ideas yourselves.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.440
I need you guys to use these ideas in your everyday

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.320
lives, with your communities, in your job if you can.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.960
But look, I know the situation looks bad,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.680
but we are actually in a very strong position

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.400
because whoever wins, either they give us

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400
what we want or they fail on the economy.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.200
And every time another idea fails, we will move closer

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.120
and closer to being the idea that takes power next.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.200
And even if Reform do win here and

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.320
it's nine years with no wealth taxes

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.560
we're not the only country in the world.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.560
This same thing is happening everywhere.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.400
You know, I got Chlöe Swarbrick on from New Zealand

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.920
really largely because I wanted to show you, especially

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.840
to our British viewers, this is happening everywhere.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.080
I think a lot of people think, oh things

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.080
are fine in Australia or in Sweden.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.400
I was in Sweden earlier this year.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.600
Same thing's happening there.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.720
Same thing's happening across Europe.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.880
Same thing's happening in Japan,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.880
which is a country know very well.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.920
This movement... one of the reasons why I've

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.240
been traveling around the world is I'm trying to

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.880
plant this seed everywhere because if it doesn't work

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.000
here, you know, it could work in another country.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.360
There's great work being done

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.720
by Gabriel Zucman in France.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.240
We just need one country to manage it, get a

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.160
wealth tax seriously, and show it can increase

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.120
living standards, and then we have a much better

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.320
chance of getting it here or wherever you are.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.040
Okay, so I'll keep doing it.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.240
You keep doing it.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.120
I want to answer the opening question of

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.320
this video, which is, is Labour saveable?

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.280
And the honest answer is I don't know.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.000
I don't know.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.120
I hope that it is.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.840
If we don't win Labour over, if we don't get the

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.680
next leader, then Labour will lose the election

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.200
and Farage and Reform will win the election, living

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.040
standards will fall, and we probably won't get

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.400
anything for nine years on wealth taxes here.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.280
That would be serious.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.360
Poverty will get worse and politics can get worse.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.000
But look, things will change.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.400
I think Labour will get a new leader next year.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.200
I know we haven't heard much from Labour

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.120
in the last few months, and it's disappointed

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.480
me as much as it's disappointed you trust me.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.040
But you know, Labour have a lot of very

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.800
new MPs that have only been there one year.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.680
They're not very powerful.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.760
They're finding their feet.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.080
I think next year there will... there'll

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.080
probably be a push to push out Starmer

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.560
and a new man or woman will come in.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560
And I think a lot of these new MPs

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.160
will start trying to find their feet

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.880
and establish themselves more seriously.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.240
You know, we did a call-out to Labour MPs

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.240
a few months ago and we did get a lot back.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.280
We got, you know, we got I think more than 10 MPs

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.760
have asked for meetings or have given them meetings.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.080
And we're trying to meet with all of them,

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.960
as well as some Liberal Democrat MPs.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.560
Look, there are people in there and we're

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.200
going to try the best we can to work with them.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.960
They're not all d**kheads.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.080
They're not all idiots.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.400
I've had some good meetings with some good

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.720
people and I'm going to try my best to build on it.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.320
And I know there'll be people out there

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.160
saying, you know, "Forget Labour, they're rubbish.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.040
Work with Zach Polansky, work with the Greens."

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.040
I'm talking to Zach, I'm talking to the Greens.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.240
We're not ruling anybody out.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.320
This is not football.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.240
This is serious.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.240
Things will get really bad if we don't do it so

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.760
I'm going to try my best to build something with Labour.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.280
And I want to do a message to Labour MPs

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.040
because I know I've spoken in ways that are

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.080
perhaps a little bit disrespectful sometimes,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.080
and I'm sorry if I've done that.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.280
I'm frustrated, you know.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.520
I see living standards falling

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.880
in this country, in my country.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.040
I come from a poor background.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.120
I know what it's like growing up poor,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.920
and I don't want that to grow.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.840
I don't want that to grow.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.280
And I've been betting on these things for 14 years.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.280
I've been making a lot of money on them.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.320
I don't want them to get worse

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.040
and I'm frustrated at the lack of

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.480
support I've been getting from Labour.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.000
But I keep turning up, I keep doing these

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.920
videos because I want to make things better.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.960
And you guys, you're in there, you're

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.400
in the seat of power, your job is supposed

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.880
to be to protect the British people.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.480
You're unpopular, you need money, I'm here to help.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.280
I'm here to help.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.840
And I don't, I don't mean

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.640
to say that in a disrespectful way.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.760
We will always be open to speaking to Labour MPs as

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.400
long as the situation is as it is, which is we need

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.760
you to help us stop this country from collapsing.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.880
I don't want the country to collapse,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.320
you don't want the country to collapse.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.640
Let's try and fix this together.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.840
But you need to be open-minded about the economy.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.760
You need to be open-minded about the idea that there

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.920
might be big economic problems that need fixing.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.720
You need to be open-minded about the idea

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.760
that it might not be just about looking at

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.480
next year's budget and next year's budget.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.440
You need to be willing to consider the idea that there

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.720
might be a big problem of large-scale wealth inequality.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.920
You need to be able to consider that distribution

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.160
might matter, that wealth inequality might matter,

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.920
that government wealth-holding might matter.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.440
And I know if you're an economist that these

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.960
ideas might be like outside of what

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.240
you were taught and outside of what you

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.400
studied and that might be, like, scary.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.680
But look at what's happening. I know if

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.200
you're from a rich background you might not see

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.520
it, but I encourage you to go and speak to

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.200
people, and get into people's lives, and look

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.600
at what is happening to poverty, and look at how

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.520
much harder it's becoming for people to buy a home.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.120
You know, I know big new ideas are scary,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.520
especially if you've got like a background in economics.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.760
And I know you might think that I'm just some working

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.320
class chancer or some kind of idiot, but look,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.520
I've got the qualifications, I've been to LSE, I've

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.000
been to Oxford, I did very well, I've got a very,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.320
very good track record of predicting as a trader.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.320
In The Public you can look at my predictions from 2020.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.840
They were very, very good.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840
Work with me here.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.120
Work with me.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.240
We need to do something.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.600
If we don't take action on growing

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.520
inequality, I absolutely guarantee you that

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.880
living standards and poverty will get worse,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.520
and worse, and worse, and worse in this country.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.920
And I don't say that lightly, I don't take that lightly.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.120
And I'm not just saying it, I'm betting on it,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.120
I've been betting on it for a long, long time.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.680
I've made a lot of money betting on it,

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.800
but I'm trying to stop it.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.280
If you do not do anything about growing inequality,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.360
poverty in this country will get worse, and

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.160
worse, and worse, and it will be your fault.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.080
Okay, so that's it, right?

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.080
I'm here, I want to work with Labour.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.120
I'm sorry if I've been

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.000
disrespectful in the past, you know.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.080
I speak with my heart sometimes.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.760
I'm worried about the future of this country.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.880
I know I need the political parties to help me.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.920
I will be here to speak to you

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.200
when you guys want to work with us.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.880
People out there who say I should forget Labour and I

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.520
should work with the Greens, I'll be here, you know.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.160
I'll be speaking to the Greens, I am speaking

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.840
to the Greens, I am speaking to Zach Polansky.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.520
I don't rule anybody out, you know.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.920
Politics is not football.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.960
This is serious.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.320
This is your life, this is your kids, your grandkids.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.240
Can they buy a house?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.560
Can they afford a family?

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.320
This is too serious to say, "I only like this

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.400
guy, I only like that guy." I will work with

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400
whoever I need to work with to make this happen.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.360
But look, if we don't win Labour and Reform come in,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.080
we keep fighting, we don't give up.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.080
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.480
And I want to finish this on a quote which

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.880
I've used before on this channel, but since it is a

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.960
quote from a somewhat legendary Labour MP, I thought

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.440
I would use it again as an olive branch to the Labour

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.720
Party, who I've said a million times I'm willing

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.360
to work with to make this country better, which is

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.840
a Tony Benn's quote that, "There is no final victory

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.000
and no final defeat, only the same battle to be

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.720
fought again and again and again. So toughen up,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.920
bloody toughen up."

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.200
I think that's how it goes

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.040
Look, thank very much, for all your support.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.960
I know it's a tough time but we keep fighting.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.880
I'll keep fighting if you do.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.360
Good luck.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.320
Tax wealth not work.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.480
Thank you.
