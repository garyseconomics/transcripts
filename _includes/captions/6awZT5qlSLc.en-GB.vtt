00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay, welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.760
Today, we're going to teach you how to

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.080
take over your country on YouTube.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.320
Okay, so I have been back in the country for

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.040
just over a month now, and I've been trying to

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.280
take in the changes in the political landscape.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.600
We find ourselves in quite an interesting situation

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.960
here in this country, across the world, especially

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.840
us as a YouTube channel, which is we are increasingly

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.440
looking like we are basically going to win the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.080
public debate on the need for some form of wealth

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.800
taxation, on the need for stopping increases in

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
inequality, on the need for preventing wealth

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.000
being sucked out of society by the very rich.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.640
But increasingly, it looks like we are basically

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.120
going to win the public and we are going to be blocked by

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.240
various institutional powers,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.400
most obviously the political parties.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.840
Here in this country, it's super interesting because

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.280
we have in power the center-left political party,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120
which is kind of the party which in theory is supposed

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.280
to be the party which allows these kind of things

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.560
to happen, allows inequality to stop increasing.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.120
We're probably going to get blocked by them, and it puts

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.960
us in this interesting situation where we have obviously

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440
taken huge amount of power politically here on this

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.200
YouTube channel, but it might end up not being enough.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440
And it leads us into this situation where we

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.080
basically need to ask ourselves, "Can we take more

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.000
power?" And that is what I hope we are going to discuss

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.440
today, how to take over your country on YouTube.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.840
And I want this to function really as a how-to.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.520
What I want to do today is really slow it down,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.600
so I think it's going to be a bit of longer video.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.520
And I want to really explain, how do you do this?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.640
Because I think if we end up in this situation where

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.240
the vast majority of the public wants something done on

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.760
inequality, but we are being blocked kind of by these

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.560
elite classes, including the left-wing political

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.440
parties, we're going to need a situation where we

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.000
really build a broad popular movement, and it will

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.360
really help if that movement is international.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.000
So I want to do a how-to here which kind of explains

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.600
what we're doing and what we're going to do, but also

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.120
explains how you yourself can try to take over

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.280
your country using social media and using YouTube.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.880
So obviously, this title, "How to Take Over Your

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.000
Country on YouTube, " is, intentionally a little

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.160
bit controversial, a little bit salacious, and I think

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.840
when you hear it, you might think, "That's ridiculous.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.520
You can't take over a country on YouTube."

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.080
and to that, I would answer, look at Donald Trump.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.200
Look at the US.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.400
Look at the US alt-right.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.760
They basically did take over their country with

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.320
a largely social media-led political campaign.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.800
Donald Trump, as you will be aware, does

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.320
not have a history of being a politician.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.120
He was not historically part of the Republican Party.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.800
He was not senator for years,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.520
like every previous president.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.800
He was basically a celebrity, and he used his

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.280
celebrity power to take over the Republican Party.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280
And especially in the most recent

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.160
election, he really aggressively used

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.640
social media to win the election.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.240
Here in the UK, we have Nigel Farage, who is

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.480
the leader of our far-right party, and I think

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.800
he will win the next election, largely because

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.400
his party and his broader political movement is

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.040
far more effective on social media, on YouTube.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.560
So as absurd as it sounds, I think if you

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.760
step back and look at it, it is obvious,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.920
and really it has been obvious for years,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.000
that traditional media is losing power.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.080
Especially in the realm of politics,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.040
social media is gaining power.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.280
And over time, social media is going to become

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.640
more and more and more powerful, and more and more

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.040
important in the realm of traditional politics.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.720
And I think what is super interesting is that even

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.520
though that move was really quite obvious five or maybe

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.960
even ten years ago, the traditional political players,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.400
by which I mean not just the traditional historic

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.840
parties, like the Conservatives and Labour

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.320
here, or the Republicans and Dems in the US.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.240
Not just the traditional political parties, but also

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.560
the traditional power players in terms of newspapers

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.080
and traditional media, simply didn't move into

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.440
this social media space, which was and still

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.240
is obviously going to become dominant in politics.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.360
And it created this just massive opportunity

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960
to almost just walk in and take political

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.120
power because the media format changed.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.080
It moved to this new space.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.600
We had all of these, like, massively powerful

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.440
institutions, like political parties, newspapers, TV

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.120
channels, that simply did not move into the new space.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.440
And the obvious example of a group that moved

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.560
into this is the US alt-right or the US alt-right,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.320
far right, whatever you want to call them.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.880
They aggressively moved in to this online space,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.320
and I think you have to give credit to them.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.120
They built a relatively successful

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.520
online political space.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520
And I've been calling

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.400
the model that the US alt-right used, I've

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.960
been calling it the WWF model, which is WWF...

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.680
WWE is the massive US wrestling corporation.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.360
I was a big fan, like most people in my

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.160
country were when we were teenagers.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.400
When you start watching WWF or when I was a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.520
kid, you walk in and there's 30, 40, 50

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.760
wrestlers, and they all have their different faces

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.520
and personalities, larger than life personalities.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.720
These guys are a group.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.000
They hate those guys.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.480
They're allied with these guys.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.320
And it creates like a very social space, basically.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.480
You pick your favorites.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
You pick the guys you like.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.600
They talk each other.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.240
You and your friends know them.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.160
And I think that, that model is obviously a very

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.440
successful model for politics, basically, because

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.840
we live in a world where young people

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.280
can't afford to go out very often.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.600
They're working really hard.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.560
Life is difficult.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.040
So they want to consume their politics

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.360
in a form that is very social.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.520
So this new kind of politics, which takes place

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.080
on social media, and which the US alt-right

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.640
has done very effectively, I think it just is

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.680
a very powerful way to do politics.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.840
And I think that the group that does

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.280
that successfully and does that well will

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.160
basically win politics in the future.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.360
But the situation we have is there is really only one

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.760
group in the world that has effectively done that, built

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.280
this kind of full and social like a cultural

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.200
space in online politics, which is the US alt-right.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.280
And because they're making this stuff in

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.000
English language, that is being watched all

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.480
over the world, especially by young people who

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.760
are comfortable watching YouTube in English.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.840
And, I think this is one of the big

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.200
reasons, basically, why the far right and

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.560
the alt-right have done really well.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.240
But you need to combine this also with the other

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.160
thing, which we talk about a lot on this channel,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.600
which is living standards are falling very quickly.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.080
Yeah, this is something I talk about in

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.920
every video, so anyone who's watched before

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.600
will know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.040
Wealth inequality is increasing very quickly.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.800
Wealth is being sucked out of governments.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.400
Wealth is being sucked out of the middle class.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.200
That is really badly affecting living standards.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.480
Western welfare states are being shut down.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.560
Ordinary people can't afford to buy homes.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.080
And that is creating this very strong sense

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.800
of dissatisfaction with current politicians

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.440
and with the current economic setup.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.120
So if you combine these two things, like an

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.320
aggressive move towards a different kind of media, that

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.120
the traditional politics and traditional politicians

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.000
and traditional media has not adapted to, and this

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.400
aggressive, and to be honest, I think justified,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.800
collapse in faith in the existing economic setup,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.400
it creates this unbelievably huge opportunity to take

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.360
an enormous amount of political power to basically

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.920
anyone who is willing and able to fill that space.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.400
So I started to realise this in 2020, basically.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.000
And from here, I'm going to kind of explain a little

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.600
bit of what we have done up till now and what my

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.520
plan has been to take the amount of political power

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.800
we've taken and to try and take more from now.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.080
I developed my ideas about inequality

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.720
when I was a professional trader in 2011.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.400
I wasn't able to successfully quit trading till 2014.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.720
And then I spent sort of a long period of

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.080
time trying to figure out, "Well, how do

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.080
we actually do something about inequality?"

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.640
And I did a variety of different things.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.120
I don't come from a political

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.840
background, and I didn't really know where to look.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.080
But since my work was trying to reduce

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.320
inequality, I kind of looked to the political

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.960
left 'cause I think that's the space you

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.640
imagine that this work would be done.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.800
I looked in the political left.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.280
You'd be surprised that there's not... there was not

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.160
actually lot of work being done in inequality there.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.120
I went back to university.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.440
I did a two-year masters at Oxford.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.320
And eventually, I decided to try

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.520
and get involved in the media.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.640
And I started to get involved in the media in 2020,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.960
which was obviously when COVID started to happen.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.600
It's easy to forget now that during COVID itself,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.640
the general narrative in the news was that

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.600
after COVID we would have a really booming economy.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.720
People used to talk about the Roaring '20s,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.120
which would be driven by pent-up demand.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.200
But I was convinced, because of really aggressive

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.120
increases in wealth inequality during COVID, that we

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.400
would have a phenomenally weak post-COVID economy.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.880
We'd have a cost of living crisis.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.440
We would have an inflation crisis.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.960
We'd have an inequality crisis.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.080
We'd have an asset price crisis,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.480
all of which has happened, obviously.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.680
If you don't believe I made those predictions,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.800
you can go and watch the

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.840
first video on this channel from June 2020.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.000
So I started making these, like, really,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.280
negative predictions in 2020.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.000
And I was writing them in The Guardian.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.800
I wrote for lot of newspapers in 2020.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.720
And a lot of my friends who were aware of

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.600
what I was doing, especially my friends from

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.200
poorer backgrounds, spoke me about these

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.320
articles, and they were like, "Oh my God,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.840
like, do you really think,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840
do you really think that's going to happen?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.120
Like, what should we do?" And,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.920
loads and loads of my friends from poorer backgrounds,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.200
were having these conversations with me.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.720
And what it made me realise was we were about to move

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720
into a period of really aggressive economic worsening.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.280
And this is on the back of, I think, 12

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.440
years already of economic worsening for

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.000
living standards for ordinary people.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.720
I realised that my friends really didn't have anywhere

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.360
to go to, to get good economic analysis.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.840
So obviously, there is economic analysis on places like

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.400
the BBC or in The Guardian and in the mainstream media,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.480
in the newspapers, but, but it's rubbish, mate.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.400
First of all, the

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.840
quality is genuinely bad, right?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.240
So I'm, you know, a former trader.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.040
As a former trader, you... I

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.400
worked for a very big investment bank.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.360
You get enormous amounts of economic analysis.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.680
We are obviously not watching,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.640
the stuff on the news.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200
Some guys might read the Financial Times, but the truth

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.320
is that economic analysis is simply qualitatively bad.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.920
But even if you separate from the low quality... And

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.320
I would add that that's largely because,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.480
like, if you're a good economist, if you're

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.920
a really good economist, you're not going to be

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.400
******* writing for the Financial Times, right?

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
You're going to be working for a bank,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.680
obviously, 'cause you just get paid so much more.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.040
Never mind, like, talking for the BBC.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.440
So the analysis itself is bad.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.080
But beyond the badness of the analysis, the

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.680
packaging and the delivery is horrendous.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.760
So, like, what chance does, like, a regular guy

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.720
have of understanding this, like, low quality, like,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.760
really unwelcoming, really inaccessible, really

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.400
difficult to understand economic analysis?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.960
And I saw that when I was writing

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.960
for The Guardian and other such newspapers in

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.440
2020, when it was obvious, to me at least, that we

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.920
were about to head into a massive economic crisis.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.480
And, when I saw that, I saw immediately, like,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.200
you are about to enter, like, a historic, massive

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.000
economic crisis, which is not even going to be

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.760
temporary, which is going to be permanent and worsening.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.880
And like 80, 90% of the country do not have

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.080
a single journalist or media outlet that

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.120
they trust to deliver economic analysis.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.680
Like, I saw that and I stopped

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.160
writing for newspapers immediately.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.440
And I, I just... Well, I was complaining

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.000
to my mates on WhatsApp like, "This is ridiculous.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.640
This is ridiculous." Like, the space

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.520
for good economic analysis on YouTube is

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.080
already massive and it's going to be enormous

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.560
and it's insane that we're not doing it.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.600
So was very fortunate, like a friend of mine in my

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.080
sort of group WhatsApp, from high school, was

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.320
like a big camera enthusiast and he was like, "Yeah,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.200
let's just start shooting videos basically." So

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.920
we started shooting videos in 2020, and I

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.160
guess now I should probably speak a little bit about

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.040
how you do build up a YouTube channel.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.920
But, first I just want to make

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.080
like the context extremely clear.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.320
I know I've said this already,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.440
but the gap is ******* massive.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.760
You know, I'm speaking to you here from

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.440
the UK, but I don't care what country

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.400
you're from, this is true in your country.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.480
The vast majority of people in your country are

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.160
really worried about the economic situation and

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.560
they do not have anybody delivering to them good

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.440
quality economic analysis, in a way they understand.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.920
That is like the

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.240
commercial gap here is enormous.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.640
People want it in video form, they want it

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.360
on social media, that is the way media is going.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.080
Nobody's delivering this.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.560
Nobody's delivering this.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.480
The gap is enormous.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.320
All right, so say you want to fill that gap.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.000
I think I'll split this bit into

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.480
two parts, which is basically what I did

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.400
and then I'll try to relate that

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.040
to like what you can do if you want to do it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.720
Because I think with social media and YouTube,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.200
the first thing to say is I don't

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.960
consider myself a social media or YouTube expert.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.800
I consider myself to be like a really good economic

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.480
expert, and I think I'm really good at economics

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.680
and I've got a lot of evidence to justify that.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.240
And I had to develop a style of communication.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.320
But for me, from the beginning, the big

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.240
picture pitch was really clear, and it's

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.640
basically what I just said to you, right?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.920
Which is good quality economic analysis, which

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.080
is clearly explained, easy to understand,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.680
accessible and welcoming to ordinary people.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.360
That was always my pitch.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.880
And I always wanted to focus it on this

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.920
particular thing, which I understand, which I think is

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.280
missing from the analysis, has been for a long time,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.960
still is to a degree, even though we are filling it,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.000
which is that wealth inequality and the

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.640
aggressive growth in wealth inequality is really,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.000
really aggressively driving living standards.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.760
So, I think what is interesting about what I did

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.280
is, it is really like in lot of ways a direct

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.520
continuation of what I did when I was a trader.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.040
So if you've read my book, you'll sort

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.160
of know that I made my money by catching this

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.720
back in 2011, that growing inequality was going to drive

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.760
the economy and was going to drive living standards.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.840
And I speak lot in my book about how

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.920
the way to make money as a trader, it's not

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.360
about being right on the economy, it's about

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.000
specifically recognising when something is

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.360
missing, when the majority opinion is wrong.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.760
Because if the majority opinion is wrong on a thing,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.240
then it means financial market prices will be wrong,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.880
which means you can make money in financial markets.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.800
So that's how I made my money as a trader,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.960
and I basically wanted to do the same thing as a

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.160
YouTuber, which is just point out this one thing,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.760
which is people don't recognise that growing

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.320
wealth inequality is really driving the economy.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.600
And that is going to mean that their predictions

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.160
are wrong, and then that's going to give us

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.800
like a really good opportunity to continually

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.600
make correct predictions in advance.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.240
And if you watch the first video on this

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.120
channel, which we'll put in the description,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.000
you'll see it's like really predictions-focused.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.120
Like, I come out and I say, "There's

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120
going to be a cost of living crisis.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.640
There's going to be an inflation crisis.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.880
House prices will go up, stock prices will

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.200
go up, gold prices will go up, inequality

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.680
will go up, government debt will go up.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.840
There'll probably be austerity." Like, it's...

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.000
And all of these predictions were predictions

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.160
which were super not consensus at the time.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.320
So when I approached the YouTube, it was

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.840
really an extension of what I did as a trader,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.280
which is, as a trader, I considered my job

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.960
to be understanding the, like, consensus

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.320
understanding of the economy and isolating

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.160
specifically what important things were missing.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.800
So, the big picture mistake that economists

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.800
have made for, 20, 30 years now is

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.280
simply not looking at the wealth distribution.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.800
Really, all you need do is really look at the

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.480
wealth distribution and you'll be like, "Oh my

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.200
God, this is like changing, like really, really,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.640
really dramatically." But at the beginning of COVID,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.960
there was this like... To be honest, it was really

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.320
amazing what happened at the beginning of COVID.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.920
Like, you had this situation now where like

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.160
the UK government has given out... total UK

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.720
government deficit since the beginning of COVID

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.920
is a trillion pounds, £20,000 pounds per person.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.400
The US number, last time I checked,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.080
was $13 trillion, $13 trillion.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.840
Like, unbelievably huge, which is

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.280
something like $50,000 per US taxpayer.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.960
So we knew these huge amounts of

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.320
money were going to be given out.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.760
We should have known that that was going to massively

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.800
affect the distribution, and we should have

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.200
known that that was going to massively affect living

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.280
standards, and nobody was talking about it.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.120
So it was, it was just a massive opportunity

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.160
to highlight something in the common understanding

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.400
and the common portrayal that was massively wrong.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.880
And, like I knew if we could get ahead

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.720
of it, we can make the videos way in advance,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.560
correctly predict everything that would happen,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.400
like, it would be like... It's gold for us.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.120
Like, at the time, obviously we... It

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.160
was the first video on the channel.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.320
We didn't have any followers.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.720
I can continue pointing back... continue pointing

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.160
back continuously to that June 2020 video

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.680
and say, "Look, we knew it in advance.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.320
Nobody else knew it." So, this obviously

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.320
was my strategy to building a social media channel,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.960
which was to basically take the thing I'm an expert

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.000
on and my preexisting expertise, which was the economy

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.800
from like a trading perspective.... pointing out what's wrong.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.280
And just explain that thing again and again,

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.320
like, really, really clearly, and, really,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.120
like, understandably and accessibly on YouTube.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.440
And if you go and, like, look through the

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.960
early videos, like, you'll see there's a lot

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.560
of, like, me ******* around in my friend's

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.440
back garden and us walking around the canals.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.160
And you'll see us basically, like, developing a style,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.280
and me developing, like, my communication style.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.360
For about a year and a half, we sort of ****ed

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.920
around trying to figure out how to do videos.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.480
The channel started in June 2020.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.680
Jan 2022, I was away for a couple of

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.680
months in Colombia, and then I came back and

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.240
I decided to get really serious about it.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.000
That's when we started doing weekly videos.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.600
We really, I really increased the

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.120
amount of energy I put into the videos.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.800
We started to make, I think, really

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.640
good videos beginning of 2022.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.320
My approach was always, there's no point trying to bring

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.080
an audience until you've got, like, 20, 25 good

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.960
videos, because you have one really good video, you

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.720
bring in an audience, there's nothing for them to watch.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.160
So I started in... in Jan 2022.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.560
That's when we started to make really good videos,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.280
and in the middle of that year is when I got

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.720
called up by a literary agent for the first time.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.480
And then we were in a situation where

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.720
we were making really good videos.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.080
I felt we were ready to bring the audience,

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.520
but the audience wasn't there yet.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.920
And, I basically saw the book

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.720
as, like, an opportunity to just

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.960
finally we've got the product there on YouTube that

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.200
the political potential power is massive.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.520
Really, I saw the book as an opportunity to basically

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.600
get a free massive PR campaign for the YouTube.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.920
And I thought that if the YouTube is ready,

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.320
and I can write, like, a really ******* good book,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.720
I can get a really good book deal from a big publisher,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.440
they will have to give us massive publicity campaigns.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.840
It will come out at a time when the economy

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.360
is collapsing, and we have the potential

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.600
to build just a massive YouTube channel.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.840
And I always remember in my early pitch meetings

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.160
with Penguin, because we were having these pitch

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
meetings in 2022, and I remember saying to them, like,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.360
"You might be worried that we are talking now in the

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.640
midst of the economic crisis, and when the book comes

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.720
out in 2024, the economic crisis will have recovered.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.520
I guarantee you the economic crisis will

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.040
be worse in 2024 than it is in 2022."

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.240
And I think time has proved that right.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.760
So, what I'm saying is, that gap to explain

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.560
what's happening economically and politically

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.800
in a clear way, is only going to grow because the

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.040
economic and political crisis is only going to worsen.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.360
And for me, that is the way that I approached it.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.040
That is the way that we approached it.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.040
I really aggressively used the book

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.800
as a way of blowing up the channel.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.080
But I want to make it clear, you don't necessarily

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.280
have to use the model that I used, and you

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.520
don't have to do the kind of content that I do.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.680
I think on social media,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.720
it's very important that you leverage... you kind

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.560
of lean into your personality and your expertise.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.600
Because if you try and... I mean, unless you

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.640
are also, you know, somebody with, like, a really

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.520
strong background in inequality economics and

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.400
trading, you're not going to be able to do what I do.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.680
But that doesn't mean that replicating in

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.600
your own style what I do is not possible.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.160
For long time I was quite worried that

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.880
my social media success was very heavily based

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.680
upon my unique backstory, and that it wasn't

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.200
replicable, which would mean that I would kind

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.840
of have to carry the weight for a long time.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.080
And that was why I was really pleased when I

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.440
saw Jimmy the Giant, who is another YouTuber,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.800
social media, politics, economics guy.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.320
When I saw him making videos about politics,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.160
economics, earlier in the year, that's why

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.920
I was so pleased see the success of his channel.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.440
Because when I saw the success of his channel, for those

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.360
of you who haven't seen Jimmy the Giant or haven't seen

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.840
his, interview on our channel, Jimmy the Giant,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.440
he's... I think he's a really nice guy, hardworking guy.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.880
I would consider him a friend now.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.320
He, you know, he hasn't been a trader.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.120
He hasn't been to these fancy economics universities.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.320
Regular guy, smart guy, hardworking guy from Milton

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.520
Keynes, just ordinary guy, ordinary background, willing

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.400
do the research, willing to do the understanding,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.000
really good at designing videos, making

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.080
videos, had a preexisting YouTube channel

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.760
doing things like parkour and subculture stuff.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.680
And he moved into this space, politics, economics,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.600
and his channel grew super, super quickly.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.760
And I think what that shows you is

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.480
people want this, people want this.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.240
There's massive demand for

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.000
doing politics, economic stuff.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.840
And you don't have to necessarily

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.120
have the background that I've got.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.920
So, the demand is there.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.600
It's not just me and Jimmy the Giant doing it.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.800
I think another guy who is really

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.560
interesting, in this country is there's,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.920
an economist called Richard Murphy.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.640
He has channel called, I think it's

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.320
called Economist Richard Murphy or something like that.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.640
Anyway, you'll find it on YouTube.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.040
And, yeah, he's not your classic influencer type,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.600
but he's created this channel which talks about

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.840
economics, aggressively talks about economics.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.080
And, you know, I don't know if he's in his

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.680
50s or his 60s, you know, gray-haired older

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.520
gentleman talking in, you know, slightly posher

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.800
accent about economics, and this guy's got

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.320
quarter of a million subs on YouTube, right?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.800
And it shouldn't work, but it does work, because,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.720
number one, Richard Murphy works, incredibly

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.280
hard, does a video every single day, which

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.200
hats off to Richard Murphy for doing that.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.640
But also just because the demand is there.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.520
And, you know, it's not just Richard and Jimmy and me.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.320
There's a guy called Ordinary Things, who does

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.760
longer form documentaries about politics, economics.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.280
He's got over a million subs.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.680
You know, that's just here in the UK.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.600
There's tons of people.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.720
Obviously, in the US you've got guys like Hasan Piker.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.000
The demand is there.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.120
The demand is there.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.560
Traditional media has just not stepped into the space.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.360
And then you have just, like, just ordinary

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.960
people like Jimmy, like... There's a guy called

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.200
Josh who runs Ordinary Things, or like me,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.080
you know, making videos in our kitchens and

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.240
getting more views than ******* Question Time.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.320
You know, getting more views than Sky News, getting more

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.400
views than BBC News, because the economy is collapsing.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.440
People want the media in a new form, and the

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.040
traditional, powerful media and political

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.360
institutions are simply not filling the space.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.400
So the opportunity there is absolutely,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.760
absolutely massive, and I would love

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.960
to see more guys making videos, running

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.320
into the space, creating video content.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.360
Have to be realistic.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.240
It's hard work.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.440
If you are successful, you will lose your privacy.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.080
You won't make ****-all money early on.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.480
You can make money from it.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.720
So we have never put like in-video advertisements.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.240
You know, we're not like... I'm not

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.280
trying to sell you Huel in these videos.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.760
I didn't get paid to say that.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.000
If you put adverts in the videos, you can

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.200
make it work, and if you see these guys, I

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.560
am independently financially secure without this,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.720
so I'm able to do it without advertisements.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.880
Stick the adverts in there,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.520
make it work, build a channel.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.600
The audience is there.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.680
If you build it, they will

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.920
come, like come into this space.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.880
And if I'm going to say that, I should shout

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.040
out the other guys who are doing it.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.920
There's a British-German influencer

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.600
making good videos called Anna Bocar.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.880
There's guy here in the UK called

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.760
Kwajo Housing, he's popular on Twitter.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.160
I'm trying to convince Jordan Stevens, who's a

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.840
member of Rizzle Kicks, to start YouTube channel.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.120
He's quite big on Insta.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.320
Novara Media have always supported us.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.160
Know Justice is another channel,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.680
who she's also on Novara Media.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.000
But there's tons, and just join the space.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.680
Jump in, jump in, if you can.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.680
Obviously, I don't need all

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.600
of you to go to YouTube Channel.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.600
You don't all need to go and, create a

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.000
social media channel, because we already have

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.680
this one, and we already have other people

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.960
who are hopefully going to fill that space.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.520
If you not going to be the guy that makes the videos, and

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.080
you don't need to be the guy that makes the videos, what

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.200
do you do to support the channels that exist, like us?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.960
And what do we do, what do I do, once you

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.360
have built this very successful political channel,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.320
to then break through these barriers that are

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.400
being put in the way by a lot of institutions,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.480
but most obviously by the political parties?

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.560
Okay, so for me, the YouTube project was always from

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.280
day one, like fundamentally, a political project.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.360
and when I say that, I don't mean I'm

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.840
trying to become an MP or I'm trying to become

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.600
Prime Minister, because I'm definitely not.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.920
I'm really hoping I never have

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.840
do either of those things.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.760
But I came into social media because I

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.520
saw this opportunity to aggressively take

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.760
political power, basically.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.600
And, the aim, for me, has always been very

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.000
clear, which is growing wealth inequality is,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.080
is totally ******* up living standards.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.640
it's going to make your kids poor and your

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.400
grandkids poor, and I want, at the very least,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.560
to stop that aggressive growth, so that

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.920
we can stop the fall in living standards.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.160
It's a simple project and I think the

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.200
simplicity is part of the power.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.680
There's a lot of potential power here, in the

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.760
sense that what is happening economically is

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.360
going to really devastate the future economic

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.280
lives of like at least 70, 80% of the country.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.720
And that, that's true both here in

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.240
the UK and it's true wherever you're watching,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.760
wherever you're from, if you're not in the UK.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440
So in a sense, politically,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.840
it's illogical, right?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.160
Because we live in democracies, and yet we have

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.200
these economic political systems which are going to

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.080
impoverish 70 to 80, maybe more percent of families.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.240
So I've always been like really, really strictly

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.640
focused on having like a very single issue

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.480
plan, which is what's going to happen is not

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.480
in the interest of the vast majority of

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.160
the public, or even a lot of the politicians.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.280
So my focus has always been to be very

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.160
single issue and strategic.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:05.200
And this is not as easy as it looks, because

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.280
we have used traditional media to grow this channel.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.760
And I've done a lot of radio, I've done

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.040
a lot of TV, I've done a lot of podcast.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.200
With the book, we got like one massive hardback

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.640
campaign, we got one massive paperback campaign.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.440
And these are all using, putting you in

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.880
newspapers, putting you in traditional media.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.720
And when you appear in traditional media,

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.960
at first, they will have you on as an expert

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.680
on the subject that you an expert in, which,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.760
in my case, is the economy and inequality.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.240
So you're appearing on shows, you're

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.800
talking about the economy, you're talking

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.160
about inequality, and I was very comfortable

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.800
doing that because what I'm an expert in.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.360
The next stage in being successful in

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.400
media is they will start asking you do,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.720
what I would call more generalist shows.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.760
So the most obvious example is they'll say,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.520
"Can you come on with Jeremy Kyle," or whatever,

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.840
"And do the news review on Sunday morning?"

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.960
And you go on, and the way it works is

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.480
you need to go on at like 8:00 in the morning.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.760
So they send you at like 7:00 in the morning or 6:30

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.440
in the morning and email with like, "We're going to cover

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.240
these 10 topics." And if you're lucky, you've negotiated

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.800
that one of those topics will be your expert topic.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.600
You're like, "Okay, I'm going to come on because

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.840
we're going to talk about the economy and inequality."

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.440
But the other nine topics are generally bull****

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.080
that you don't know nothing about, right?

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.920
And that's, this is the way the media works, right?

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.160
You know, I'm an expert on inequality and I'm

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.240
getting a list of 10 things, and I have to talk

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.840
about, if I'm lucky, inequality, and also *******

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.840
Prince William and ******* smash the boats and

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.120
******* all kind of ******* Love Island last

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.040
night and all this kind of bull****, basically.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.120
So I did it once.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.000
I went on this show, and, suddenly,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.360
you're put in this weird situation where you're

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.720
forced to talk as if you're an expert on all kinds

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.960
of bull**** you're not an expert on, basically.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.600
So the media tries to push you into this generalist

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.960
role, and, for me, I felt that was basically,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.440
if I did that kind of show, it would discredit me as an

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.800
expert on the thing I'm genuinely an expert on, which

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.120
is the collapse of living standards in this country.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.680
And because the thing that I'm an expert on

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.680
should be something you're interested in, and the

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.880
majority of the country should be interested in if

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.440
you don't want to impoverish your grandkids and your

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.600
kids. I felt that it was better to basically reject any

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.640
generalist media and only accept any media that

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.240
would, let me talk about the economy.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.600
And, if you... There's an interesting example

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.720
of this, is when I went for the one and only time on

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.160
Politics Live, which I think was the beginning of 2023.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.080
And, I went on and they put inequality on the panel.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.120
And I got asked to talk about all kinds of ****.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.240
I got asked to talk about lab-grown meat.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.440
And whenever I got asked to talk about anything that

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.080
wasn't inequality, I just aggressively refused and

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.760
said, "Listen, I'm here to protect your kids

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.280
from falling into poverty, and I'm going to talk

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.080
about the inequality, I'm going to talk about taxation."

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.000
And I... and they never called me back.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.640
But it worked for us.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.440
It worked for us and it's still working for us.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.480
And I was able to do that because I knew that I had a

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.320
book deal and I knew that I'd get a big press campaign.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.240
But also if you look at when I

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.600
went on Piers Morgan earlier this year,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.120
I had a really similar strategy basically.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.160
Like, I know... Piers Morgan is part of this like,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.800
very successful, very popular alt-right US media.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.000
And I watched Piers Morgan going in and then I saw what

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.280
they did, which is, we exist in a political climate

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.600
which is very fractious and there's a lot of hate.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.520
And people who consider themselves to be on the

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.760
right, hate who they see as being on the left.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.240
And people who consider themselves to be on the

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240
left, hate people who they see as being on the right.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.640
I personally honestly don't

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
think I'm on the left or right.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.120
I just think I'm ******* right on the

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.000
economy and don't want the economy to collapse.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.480
So, I knew that they were going to try to sort

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.600
of pigeonhole me as like, as left-wing, and my

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.040
plan was to just, again, refuse to talk about

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.520
anything that would identify me as left-wing.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.600
So, they use what is called a wedge issue.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.320
This is like, another interesting concept.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.080
Like, a wedge issue... A wedge issue is

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.480
like, is a politics media way that you

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.560
use to discredit your opponent, which is you...

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.400
They come in with an issue they're strong on.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.880
So for me, it's like, "Inequality is

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.040
****ed up, the billionaires pay no tax.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.920
Cut tax on working people, raise tax on billionaires.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.320
It's super popular, and if you're not an idiot,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.600
you should support it." So, I come in with that.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.600
These guys are basically paid stooges

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.000
for billionaires half the time.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.280
And they don't... Whatever they want, they don't

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.200
want to talk about that, because they don't want to talk

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.160
about the one thing which the public love, which is

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.280
going to mean taxing them and their ******* paymasters.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.200
So, they try to move the subject of conversation onto

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.440
a wedge issue, which is an issue which they think

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.680
your opinion is going to be at odds with their audience.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.840
So, when I went on Piers Morgan, they asked me,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.280
"What do you think of Donald Trump?" And they

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.680
want me to say, "******* Donald Trump, he's such a

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.000
*****," basically because their audience is the US

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.160
alt-right, which is largely Donald Trump supporters.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.560
And they want me to say that, and then

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.000
they're going to say, "Oh well, look, this guy,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.760
he's on the other ******* team.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.880
Hate this guy.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.600
Don't tax the rich.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.440
They're dickheads." And they asked me that about

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.080
Donald Trump and they asked me that about Elon Musk.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.720
And both times, I just said, "I don't ******* know.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.640
I've never met Donald Trump.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.880
I've never met Elon Musk.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.800
Do you know him?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.240
Have you met him?" I think Piers

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.200
Morgan has met him apparently.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.840
But basically, I think once you have the channel,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.920
I think the political power is

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.600
just relentless focus on message.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.200
Relentless focus on message.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.840
And I think the reason that we have a lot of potential

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.040
political power here is because we are talking about

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.800
the issues that the vast majority of the country cares

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.040
about, which is the impoverishment of their families.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.760
If you don't do something on inequality,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.520
you will, your kids will be ******* poor and they will

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.120
live in a tiny little house, and they will struggle

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.160
pay the rent, and they will struggle to pay the bills.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.840
That will get worse and worse.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.360
Healthcare system will collapse,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.400
education system will collapse.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.280
So for me, I think the political power

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.320
is like, relentless focus on message.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.720
So, if you are worried about the growth in inequality

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.520
and you are not looking start your own social

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.120
media channel, which you absolutely 100% don't

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.480
want to do, the key thing that I want you to do

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:27.000
is to be an amplifier of this very simple message.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.800
Which is, if you don't deal with growing inequality

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.320
of wealth... This is not about doctors and lawyers.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.080
This is about people who hoard huge amounts of assets.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.920
If you don't deal with that asset hoarding,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.680
their wealth share will grow and grow and grow.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.240
Your kids' wealth share will fall and fall and fall.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.120
Government wealth share has already collapsed.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.040
And what that means is, no houses for your kids,

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.520
no NHS, no healthcare system, no education system,

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.280
no local services, the ******* police, everything.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.960
That's what you lose.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.320
You lose your house, you lose

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.960
your ability to pay the bills.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.560
That's what it is.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.560
Simple message.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.360
I want you to really... For me, from the very

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.880
beginning, what... The big thing I want to do is

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.480
to build that bridge of understanding, connecting

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.120
the reason your living standards are falling

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.840
is because of growing wealth inequality.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.600
Their share of the pie is growing and growing and

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.880
growing and growing, and your share of the pie is

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.920
shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.680
Unless you do something about their aggressive,

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.200
rapid growth in wealth of the super rich,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.440
your kids will live in poverty.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.520
Simple message.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.400
Simple message.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.840
So, I think that simplicity

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.840
of message is super powerful.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.320
I think we are winning the public here on that.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.960
We are in this situation now where we're largely

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.920
being blocked by kind of elite institutions,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.960
and I'm going to speak about that next.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.320
But what I need... The only reason that we

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.000
are as close as we are to getting this, and

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.720
I think we're unbelievably closer than we

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.640
were a couple of years ago, is because of the

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.680
strength and the power of that simple message.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.040
And because of the amplification

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.640
we get through ordinary people.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.600
So, it's unbelievably important you keep amplifying

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.120
this message amongst your friends, amongst your family.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.560
And for those of you in other countries,

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.000
this channel is not as popular outside the UK.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.880
It's also popular in Australia

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.600
and Ireland and places.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.200
But in other countries, this message and this channel

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.280
is not as popular, which means there is a massive

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.400
space for you to do, in your country, what I'm doing.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.200
I would ******* love to see somebody in

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.920
the US doing what I'm doing in an American

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.320
accent and winning the American people.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.920
But, you know, the same thing in Germany, Italy,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.080
Spain, Netherlands, France, Japan, everywhere.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.280
I know we're getting watched all over

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.440
Scandinavia, Canada, all of your places.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.680
There's massive space to build that message, build

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.720
that message, build that message, build that message.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.880
Because the power that we have, the power that

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.280
this channel has, all comes from a clear message

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.000
on social media being amplified by viewers.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.440
And listen, this is what Rupert Murdoch does.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.040
This is what the mainstream media does.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.680
The mainstream media is dying.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.360
We can occupy that space.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.640
We can be Rupert Murdoch.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.400
And if we are Rupert Murdoch,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.840
we get what we ******* want.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.760
So how do we deal with the blockers?

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.560
How do we deal with the blockers?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:16.720
Okay.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720
What do I mean when I say blockers?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.000
Okay, so for long time, I'll be honest, I didn't think

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.720
we were going to win this project, and I thought there

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.360
was opportunity, which I tried to run into, and I

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.640
didn't... Well, to be honest, once I started writing the

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.480
book, I thought we had a good chance, but like, I never

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.480
thought we'd be as successful as we have been, right?

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.040
In terms of winning public opinion.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.000
We have massively

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.280
won public opinion now in this country.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.800
There's a lot of progress be done in other

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.920
countries, and it's absolutely important that we

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.440
continue to win public opinion in this country.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.720
I didn't think we would win the comms battle

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.840
because I thought we were up against the super rich.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.760
Now I think we will, and I think, be honest, in

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.280
this country, we almost have won the comms battle.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.480
You know, I spoke about it a couple of videos

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.880
ago, the vast majority of the public, even

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.480
Conservative voters, even Reform voters, support

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.040
wealth taxes, support a fairer taxation system,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.920
think that the super rich should get... should

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.160
pay tax at least the same rates as the rest of us.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.600
That is one, and yet we are now here in a situation

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.680
where... So I called out Labour in the last... two

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.640
weeks ago, and we got, I think, five MPs come back.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.480
I think they've got 450 MPs or something,

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.600
like that, and we got five MPs back, right?

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.880
So that tells you where we are in Labour, and it was

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.400
largely MPs who are sort of a bit ostracised as being

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.280
considered on the left or the far left of the party.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.080
So why are we in a situation where the public

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.720
want it and a center-left political party

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.360
called Labour, who are supposed to

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.240
represent working people, are blocking it?

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.560
So I think what you need to understand here is

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.520
that we... As inequality grows, our society

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.280
bifurcates, and what I mean by that is our

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.400
society kind of splits into two lanes.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.040
And it's a bit... You know, it's obviously not as

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.120
clear as two lanes, but as inequality grows and

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.600
wealth gets concentrated at the top, what you get is

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.720
these very, very rich people at the top,

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.200
they're getting really, really rich.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.160
The public is getting really, really poor.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.240
They start to live very different lives,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.760
basically, and rich people will go to elite

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.320
private schools, and they'll go like, an

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.880
elite university, and they'll get elite jobs.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.760
I was in, Westminster this

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.800
week, and like, I went to Oxford for

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.400
a Master's degree, and it was amazing.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.360
The place is exactly like Oxford,

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.480
an Oxford College, basically.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.760
And you see that Westminster, just like Oxford

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:49.440
University, is just a part of this very separate elite

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.680
world, basically, that doesn't really inhabit

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.480
the same space that you inhabit.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.320
Most of them, especially the ones

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.120
who influence the culture, are rich.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.040
They come from rich families.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.360
They've often been rich for several generations.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.360
They view themselves as the rich, and when I

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.080
come out saying, "Tax the rich," they have a

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.920
very strong emotional reaction against that.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.040
And I want to be clear, it's important

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.800
that I say it, we're not trying to tax

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.480
people earning 100, 200 grand a year.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.640
We're trying to cut tax on working people.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.360
We're trying to raise tax on people who have

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.120
100 million, a billion in assets.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.920
So most of these people not in that bracket,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.840
but there's a kind of instinctive, small-C

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.240
conservativism that comes from rich people, from

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.240
rich families, which is, "Listen, we're winning here.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.760
We don't want rock the boat." It's important to

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.240
recognise when you have a crisis of inequality, it

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.600
damages living standards for the majority of people,

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.160
but for the top 5%, for the top 1%, especially for

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.920
the top 0.1%, they get richer and richer and richer,

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.640
and richer, richer, and they don't want to stop it.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.080
So at the moment, we are in a kind of situation

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.240
where we've won the public, and it's very important

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.000
that we keep winning the public, and it's very

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.360
important that that spreads to other countries.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.880
But the elite institutions, and it's not just

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.240
politics, it's also the universities which influence

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.000
the way people think about economics, the media, which

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.240
influences the way people think about economics, the

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.880
think tanks, which try to shape policy on economics.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.000
All of these elite spaces,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.880
central banks as well, are full of

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.560
rich people that are benefiting from the situation,

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.640
and they basically don't want things to change.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.680
All right, so what do you do?

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.200
And in a sense, at this point in

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.040
the video, it becomes what do we do?

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.320
Because I've kind of gone through

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.920
how we got to where we are now.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.040
I'm unbelievably proud of the work that we've

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.680
done, and I'm very grateful to you guys.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.320
I've said it before, this, in a sense, was a

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.520
political experiment, which was, can we take

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.280
political power without any billionaire funding?

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.040
Just some guys making videos, being clear, being

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.960
honest, and amplifying that message through the public.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.440
And a really interesting thing has happened here.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.040
Before I made this channel, I was floating

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.800
around this kind of left-wing think tank

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.960
space, trying to find someone to do anything

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.880
on inequality, and I couldn't find anything.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.000
And all I found was a bunch of guys... Okay, first

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.640
thing I'll say is this: I've had a lot of support

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.840
from good people in this space, but in general,

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.560
that left-wing think tank space, all they are doing

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.520
is lobbying politicians, lobbying politicians,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.160
lobbying politicians, lobbying politicians.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.240
And I decided to try something new, which

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.840
was to speak to the public, to educate the

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.920
public, and achieve power over politicians

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.360
by having support from the general public. So it's,

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.160
in a sense, it's kind of like a reinvention of

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.760
******* democracy on YouTube, and it's working.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.840
It's working, right?

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.600
I can get meetings with these guys, and I think

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.160
as we approach the election, if we can keep growing

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.120
this social media platform, I think we can get into a

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.640
situation where basically they have to give it to us.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.440
So there is a lot of reluctance in the Labour

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.280
Party, and you know, if you're in Germany, it'll

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.400
be the same thing from your center-left party.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.200
If you were in the US under Biden, you

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.400
would have seen this, you know, just

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.200
the center-left parties are reluctant.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.720
They are reluctant partly because

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.040
they live in their little bubbles.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.400
This... They just don't like the idea of

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.280
tax the rich. Their funders don't like it.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.480
A lot of their friends and their colleagues are rich.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.280
They don't like it.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.320
They don't want to give it to us.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.400
I think with enough public support, we can force it.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.640
Some people might say I'm naive on that,

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.240
but we are... The strength that we have is

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.920
this analysis of the economy is correct, and if we

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.960
don't get what we want, which is movement

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.920
on the taxation of wealth, movement on

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.280
inequality, living standards will keep falling.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.480
So these political parties will

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.480
fail unless they work with us.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.520
And the public discontent will grow

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.960
and grow and grow and grow and grow.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.040
And this political space, especially online, which

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.400
is people hate the mainstream political parties, they

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.000
want something different, will only grow, and I think

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.360
there's an enormous amount of space for us to grow into.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.560
So the plan for me at the moment is... I've always said

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.080
I view what we do strategically as two separate

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.840
fights, which is one, the fight for winning

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.360
comms, which means we need to win the public.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.440
We need public support.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.600
If we don't have public support, we don't get anything.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.280
And second is implementation, and

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.600
implementation is a lot more tricky.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.280
Implementation means making sure these *******

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.960
taxes are really well designed, making sure we have

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.080
enough connections within the political parties

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.240
that we can, we can get these policies through.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.680
And it means having, like getting some support

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.760
from this kind of like elite posh boys club, which

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.960
is like academics and think tank, 'cause I...

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.640
Unfortunately, I don't think we'd get it without them.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.920
And I've always said I focus on the comms battle

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.560
because you don't get to fight the implementation

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.040
battle until you win the comms battle.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.280
Now, as we win the comms battle, I'm starting

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.200
to move towards that implementation battle.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.680
And in the last few weeks, I cannot explain to you

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.720
how many meetings I've had, with think tanks

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.440
and with politicians and with academics and with the

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.960
people in the media and with other influencers

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.800
to try to make sure that as we come into

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.400
that next election, I have everything ready

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.200
to hold the politicians' feet to the fire.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.440
I'm also speaking to other political parties.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.440
Basically, this is the way that it works.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.240
If my YouTube and social media presence is big enough,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.600
as we come into that election, then I can demand

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.600
and I can get meetings with those Labour MPs.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.040
It's as simple as that.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.600
And the only reason I can get those meetings is

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.080
because you guys keep watching and sharing the videos.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.400
It's as simple as that.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.800
But as we get closer to actually winning the

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.080
fight, I need to also make sure that we have the

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.280
tax policy firmly in place, which means I need

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.600
to be talking to economists behind the scenes,

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.280
making sure that it's properly well designed,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.840
that we have some connections in the political parties.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.360
Because if we don't have anything,

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.600
I don't think we're going to get it.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.440
But basically, I'm in quite a difficult

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.400
position, because all my power comes from the

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.600
popularity and the quality of these videos.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.160
But I do now need to start talking to lots of different

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.520
groups of people, politicians in this country,

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.000
politicians in other countries, influencers, people

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
to really make sure this tax policy is designed.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.280
And I need to do all of those meetings

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.040
whilst also making these videos ******* good.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.720
So, that's what I'm going to be doing.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.120
It would really, really help if we had more

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.160
influencers in more countries doing this work.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.360
The more focus we can have on the

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.320
simplicity of ******* message, the better.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.640
I spoke about message discipline

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.640
before I went away.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.560
This will not work if it's just me.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.080
We had like, an old politician,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.480
Neil Kinnock, come out about a month

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.360
ago on the news in the UK, say, "We want

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.760
a wealth tax." That's my tax, all right?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.600
Not just me.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.520
Great work being done by PMUK

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.080
and TJUK on these kind of things.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.000
He didn't say Gary's tax policy.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.760
This is the way that you make something common sense.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.880
You... It needs to be less Gary's

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.600
policy and more simple understanding.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.320
If you don't deal with aggressive increases

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.520
in inequality, living standards will fall.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.560
The way to deal with that is changing

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.000
the tax policy, tax the rich more, tax

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.720
working people less, tax wealth, not work.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.280
We need more people doing the simplicity of message.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.280
We need more people online.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:47.680
I am probably, on this series, going to try to

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.800
get other influencers that I want to support

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.520
on, because I want to build that kind of WWF

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.840
model media to compete with that US alt-right.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.440
When I say that, I want to be really, really clear.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.560
If you are out there supporting the US alt-right

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.000
or supporting any alt-right, we're not against you.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.640
We're trying protect your living standards.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.240
Always be careful about distribution and inequality.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.120
We're going to build this space.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.680
We're going to keep making videos.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.800
Unfortunately, this season, my energy is

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.760
going to have to shift a little bit towards

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.560
building stuff behind the scenes, which is

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.160
going to mean I have less focus on the videos.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.800
You guys need to keep watching.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.880
You need to keep watching.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.480
I'm going to do my best to do both

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.560
of these things at the same time.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.320
Keep watching.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.640
Watch other channels as well.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.840
Keep the simplicity of message.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.320
I think next week I'm going to do video that

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.080
basically focuses on, how do you convince your

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.280
friends and family that inequality is the problem?

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.120
Because this is a political experiment.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.600
Can you take over your country on social

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.560
media, on YouTube, by using ordinary people

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.760
as your amplifier instead of billionaires?

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.040
I think we can do it.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.560
And the reason we can do it is because

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.720
the competition's ******* ****.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.720
It's a bunch of posh boys who all went the same

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.320
school and they know what the ****'s going on.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.960
And we're better than them, aren't we?

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.160
All right, so keep following, keep watching.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.600
I know it was a long one this week, but

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.240
I wanted really center what we're doing.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.240
And listen, you know, keep

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.800
watching, keep buying the book.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.960
If the book turns up in the number, in the top 10,

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.760
if it gets back to number one, that's massive for us.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.800
It keeps us in the news.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.560
I've said it lot of times before, we don't

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.560
win this today, we don't win this tomorrow,

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.720
but the direction of travel is we're winning.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.680
The opportunity is growing and growing.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.440
So, listen, stick with us.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.680
I'm already ******* knackered

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.640
and I've only been back a month.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.160
So, if I look tired and the videos are

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.080
maybe not as sharp as they used to be, do

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.600
forgive me, but I have to ******* meet with

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.680
politicians every day and it's stressing me out.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.640
Thank you very much.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.800
Send this video to your friends.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.280
Send to your mum.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.000
Let's take over the country, my country,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.600
your country too, wherever you are.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.800
Tax wealth, not work.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.600
Fight back.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.320
Protect your living standards.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:46.960
Protect your kids.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.400
Thank you.
