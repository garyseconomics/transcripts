00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.040
it's not a conspiracy - it's an&nbsp;idiocracy 
honestly that's what it is 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.920
like it's a bunch of guys that wear nice suits and&nbsp;
have nice haircuts patting each other in the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.800
saying aren't we all so ****ing smart &amp; being wrong&nbsp;
year after year after year after year after year

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.520
no this is the thing i think about a lot and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.000
which is basically kind of economic&nbsp;
conspiracy theories um that are driven by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.280
the internet sometimes by youtube&nbsp;
the first thing i want to say is look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.720
the situation we are in is bad i'm 100% aware of&nbsp;
that and the situation that we have put a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.040
people especially young people but not just young&nbsp;
people in is really bad these people they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.000
know how they're going to ever be able to support&nbsp;
family how they're ever going to be able to afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.560
a decent home increasingly they don't even know&nbsp;
how they're going to pay the food and bills right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.680
and at the same time the information&nbsp;
that they've been given on the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.120
is confusing it's not clear very often in my&nbsp;
opinion it's flat out wrong you know i talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.880
about it again and again 450 billion pounds got&nbsp;
given to the rich in the last three years from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.280
government an enormous enormous amount of money&nbsp;
and you should expect that that will push prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.160
up and cause crises of inequality and of living&nbsp;
standards and of inflation for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.800
that's actually not super complicated we've spoken&nbsp;
about on the channel no one on the news is talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.120
about it so if this is the context you're in you&nbsp;
can understand why people are going to be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.880
oh my god this is like a conspiracy theory&nbsp;
the information is being kept from us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
so i want to talk a little bit about&nbsp;
the situation and the situation is in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.800
in many ways is worse right the the cold truth of&nbsp;
the matter is these guys are not smart enough to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.160
make a conspiracy theory listen i've worked in&nbsp;
economics for a long time okay i've worked in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.120
one of the biggest investment banks in&nbsp;
the world i studied at the london school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.640
of economics (LSE) i studied at Oxford&nbsp;
i've been in around the media now

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.160
it's not the case that these guys know&nbsp;
what's happening and are hiding it from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.120
these guys are clueless they are just&nbsp;making 
it up as they go along like seriously like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.920
when they said at the beginning of the crisis that&nbsp;
they thought house prices will come will collapse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.680
and then when they said they thought they'd&nbsp;
be a really aggressive bounce back because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.200
demand pent-up demand was the phrase they believe&nbsp;
all that stuff they believe all that stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.640
and the truth is this is what happens this is what&nbsp;
happens right something happens and these guys say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.640
oh my god what is going to happen somebody just&nbsp;
shouts a story thing out like oh well an idea well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.520
there's going to be pent up demands so we're&nbsp;
going to have a big bounce back and these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.920
just write it because they have to write you know&nbsp;
what i mean they're not even stopping to think &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.160
am i right? am i wrong? that the truth is like 
this&nbsp;is the blind leading the blind here you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.120
we shouldn't live in a world where a 24 year&nbsp;
old kid can walk into one of the biggest banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.920
in the world and be the best trader in the world&nbsp;
at that bank but we do live in that world because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.040
even on the trading floors and these guys work the&nbsp;
longest hours have the best information have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.960
best incentivization scheme normally are the best&nbsp;
qualified even there most people have got no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.440
what they're talking about and i think ultimately&nbsp;
what this comes down to and we've spoken about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.200
this in a video before is this problem of why&nbsp;
do all of the best jobs go to rich kids you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.440
ultimately you know i was speaking to somebody&nbsp;
from the Observer and i said to him look your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.000
newspaper is based in London how many kids do&nbsp;
you have in your newspaper who talk like me?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.200
none, right none and you know i worked in&nbsp;
the skyscraper just over there this is we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.120
been filmed in east London i worked in the&nbsp;
skyscraper just over there somebody asked me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.720
on the trading floor that's an interesting accent&nbsp;
where are you from you know what i mean right &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.320
what does that tell you about how we are using 
our&nbsp;best and our brightest and our smartest kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.560
you know it's 10 million people in the city and&nbsp;
you can't find a single ordinary person to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.640
in the newspapers or work in the skyscrapers right&nbsp;
we've developed a system where we basically funnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.280
kids from rich families into private schools&nbsp;
and elite jobs without ever really stopping to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.560
ask are these guys any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good and listen i&nbsp;
can guarantee you in the majority of cases these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.640
guys they know how to look smart they know how to&nbsp;
talk smart but they never started thinking once in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.840
their lives they just walked into these spaces&nbsp;
you know what i mean so then the end result is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.280
it's not a conspiracy it's a it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;
idiocracy honestly that's what it is like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.320
a bunch of guys that wear nice suits and have nice&nbsp;
haircuts patting each other in the back and saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.840
aren't we all so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smart and being wrong year&nbsp;
after year after year after year after year and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.840
almost wish it was a conspiracy because the truth&nbsp;
is in a way more horrific than that which is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.560
there's kids all over the city that are smarter&nbsp;
than the guys in those newspapers and in those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.040
skyscrapers and they're being wasted wasted&nbsp;
um and then if you are you know someone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.680
actually figures it out which is not easy to do&nbsp;
right because you know the stuff you learned at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.280
university and the guys who taught university&nbsp;
are kind of done you have to work out yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.720
basically if you do work out then these banks will&nbsp;
pay you a million pound data to shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.320
you know what i mean so then the end result&nbsp;
is it's not a case of conspiracy it's simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.960
a case of very wealthy people can afford the best&nbsp;
resources and that includes the best analysis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.400
somebody like me can get paid a million pounds&nbsp;
a year to work in them skyscrapers but i choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.920
to tell people for free on youtube because i&nbsp;
want people to know what is going to happen so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.280
they can stop it because what is going to happen&nbsp;
is going to be a disaster for ordinary people so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.360
it's not conspiracy this is simply a case of look&nbsp;
watch the video what is well the rich people own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.560
everything they have all the income they can buy&nbsp;
the best resources the best analysis realistically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.720
do you think the best economists on the world are&nbsp;
going to be talking on the bbc news why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.800
would they? they could make so much more money&nbsp;
working for the skyscrapers you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.360
so in reality it's not about conspiracy it's&nbsp;
simply about rich people trying to get richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.320
buying the best resources buying the best&nbsp;
knowledge and that means ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.360
are not going to get good resources for free&nbsp;
and i think that's why it's that's why i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.920
it's so important that i do this as somebody&nbsp;
who was one of the best paid economists i give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.800
the people good information because people in&nbsp;
the city the best people in the city they know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.080
this is happening they know this is happening but&nbsp;
they're bought into it they're well paid to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.800
and they feel that they can't stop it and&nbsp;
whether i can stop it i don't know but i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.840
feel like i deserve to at least try and people&nbsp;
deserve to to be told what's happening so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.880
my concern with these conspiracy theories is they&nbsp;
get people to be too negative and they get people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.960
to be angry but the only way we win this is if&nbsp;we
get people to be positive and if we get people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.160
to come together you know these conspiracies&nbsp;
drive division they drive people apart and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.680
they force people into sort of panicked modes&nbsp;
of thinking look - its 70-80-90% of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.560
getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here these people just need to come&nbsp;
together turn around and say no and this will stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.240
and that is a question of people&nbsp;
coming together so it can happen um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.880
but you need good information you need good advice&nbsp;
and you need something positive to get behind so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.080
um i'm trying to do that i'm trying my best to be&nbsp;
that so if you like the information you're getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.440
tell your friends tell your family um and&nbsp;
let's make something positive happen because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:43.840
because positive change is possible&nbsp;
man that's why i do this keep watching

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.200
because we are draining the resources&nbsp;
of this economy and giving it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.720
super rich who do not pay any tax 
yeah&nbsp;he's my boy man he's my boy 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:05.280
i like to see a billionaire just take the mask 
off&nbsp;for once and just directly rob everyone
