00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.960
My name is Gary Stevenson 
former&nbsp;trader &amp; people's economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.920
This is gary's economics, today we're going&nbsp;
to talk about tax and national insurance

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.440
OK, so if you've been following the news the&nbsp;
last couple of months you will have seen 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.960
that the conservative government has
raised national&nbsp;insurance contributions

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.880
that means that as long as you work 
for your money your pay packet 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.600
is going&nbsp;to go down at the beginning 
of the next tax year&nbsp;by an extra 1.25%

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000
now what does that mean? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880
the first thing is we need to explain 
very&nbsp;clearly what national insurance is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.360
National&nbsp;insurance is a fixed percentage of your
salary which goes to the government as tax.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.640
It's very&nbsp;simple, people think or like to say that 
it's used to pay for your pension or social&nbsp;care &nbsp;

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.800
but it's not! it's just a tax in many ways
exactly like income tax 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.520
a certain percentage comes&nbsp;out your
salary &amp; goes to government's tax 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.840
how is it different to income tax and&nbsp;
why is the government chosen to raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.320
national insurance instead of income tax&nbsp;
okay so there are a few key differences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.800
the first thing is you start paying&nbsp;
national insurance at a lower rate of salary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.720
so you don't pay national insurance 
until you make about £9,500 a year 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.640
and you don't pay income tax
until about £12,500 a year

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840
so people on very low incomes will 
pay national insurance whereas

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.480
slightly higher&nbsp;income before you 
need to start paying income tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.840
the second important thing is income tax is 
what&nbsp;we call a progressive tax

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.520
in the sense that it's designed so that the
higher your income the more&nbsp;money you make

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.400
a higher percentage that you pay 
so you only start paying 20% 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.840
on low amounts of income and then on
very high amounts of income you pay 40%

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.800
national insurance is designed the opposite 
way so&nbsp;you pay 12% on low incomes&nbsp;and then

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.680
when you get&nbsp;to higher incomes you 
only pay 2% so it's intentionally designed

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.960
National Insurance, so that very rich 
people pay a very low percentage.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
unlike income tax where very high 
income people pay a high percentage

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.960
so that's strange, it's a very&nbsp;strange design 
of tax, it's designed specifically&nbsp;so that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.000
rich people pay less than poor people in&nbsp;
terms of a percentage of their overall income 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.600
The third big difference is that national insurance 
is designed so that only working people pay it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.480
now if you watched my earlier video 
'what is wealth?' you will&nbsp;understand

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.280
that whilst the vast majority of people in 
this country make their money from working

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000
most&nbsp;very very rich people and families 
don't make the&nbsp;money from work but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
instead own huge amounts of&nbsp;assets 
and get income from those assets 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720
so while you might be working 
and making £30,000 a year

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.000
somebody who has a wealth of 
£1,000,000,000 like Rishi Sunak's family

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.200
will make £30,000,000 a year 
just from owning so much assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.960
national insurance does not tax income&nbsp;
from assets it only taxes income from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:01.800
A 1.25% rise which is what they voted through&nbsp;
if you make £30,000 a year you'll pay £250 extra

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.480
If you are like Rishi Sunak's father-in-law 
and you have a £1,000,000,000

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.440
you'll make about £30,000,000 a year 
and&nbsp;you'll pay nothing (in tax)

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.400
so it's a very interesting tax
high income people pay low percentages&nbsp;

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.320
and extremely wealthy people pay nothing
whereas very low income people pay it

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.400
and ordinary&nbsp;workers pay it
so to be honest it's a pretty bad tax

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.880
falls largely on poor &amp; middle income people&nbsp;
totally ignores very very high income people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.880
especially if you're extremely wealthy&nbsp;
and your income comes from wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.920
now if you watched my first video 'how the rich&nbsp;
get richer from covid-19' you will have seen that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.920
during covid-19 the rich made a huge amount&nbsp;
of money especially the very rich we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.680
data on that now we can see that billionaires&nbsp;
in this country saw their wealth increase by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.560
about 22% so the top 3 billionaires saw their&nbsp;
wealth increase by £20 billion just in Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.840
the top 250 had a wealth increase of over 
£100&nbsp;billion so why is it that after a crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.680
where ordinary people suffered and the rich got&nbsp;
very very rich the government has chosen a tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.840
which makes high-income people pay a low percent&nbsp;
and makes extremely wealthy people pay nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.600
i don't think the answer is very complicated it's&nbsp;
probably because our chancellor is a billionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.200
so this guy probably doesn't want to raise taxes&nbsp;
on billionaires um but you know it's not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.240
the chancellor if you if you look at other senior&nbsp;
politicians like David Cameron like George Osborne&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.440
like Nick Clegg like Tony Blair, if we look at&nbsp;
what they've done since they left office generally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.880
they've gone to work for big corporations&nbsp;
and made extremely high salaries so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.280
David Cameron for example went to work for Greensil&nbsp;
which is a company which went bust but he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.920
making i think over $10 million working there so&nbsp;
if we live in a world where the main politicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.400
become multi-multi-millionaires or even&nbsp;
are billionaires when they're in office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.560
they are unlikely to raise taxes on&nbsp;
multi-millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.400
the end result is they raise taxes on people&nbsp;
making 20 or 30 grand a year ordinary people

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.920
now if you watch my video what is wealth you will&nbsp;
see that we already have a system where wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.200
inequality is very high, a lot of money transfers&nbsp;
from people who don't have wealth towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.280
owners of wealth every single year which means&nbsp;
they get richer and ordinary people get poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.760
this is why housing is becoming less affordable&nbsp;
and why the economy is struggling to recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.480
if we add on top of that system where we raise&nbsp;
taxes on ordinary people and we specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.160
exclude multi-millionaires and billionaires this&nbsp;
is going to get worse much quicker and it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.800
to affect ordinary families their ability&nbsp;
to get jobs their ability to get houses so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.600
basically it's a corrupt system&nbsp;
we've just come out of a crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.080
where lots of people have died many more&nbsp;
people have suffered serious financial hardship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.160
and yet multi-millionaires and billionaires have&nbsp;
seen their wealth increase by an enormous amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.960
after that when the country needs money&nbsp;
and this money is being raised to pay for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.360
elderly care rather than taxing the billionaires&nbsp;
who made a fortune during the crisis a literal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.280
billionaire chancellor is taxing you&nbsp;now
if we stand by and let this happen then

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.080
next time there's a crisis, next time they need 
money&nbsp;what do you think they're going to do?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.080
They're gonna do the same thing again they're 
gonna protect multi-millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.080
because they themselves are multi-millionaires and&nbsp;
billionaires and they're gonna tax you your money

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.480
instead of them and their billionaire mates so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.080
i think now is an important time to take a&nbsp;
stand to push back to do whatever you can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.160
know that means talking to your friends and family&nbsp;
explaining what's happening show them this video

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.880
send a letter to your MP telling me&nbsp;
you're not happy about it you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.320
especially if you have a conservative&nbsp;
MP (who are in power) ask them why are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.680
these guys not taxing billionaires ask them&nbsp;
why they're taxing ordinary people instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.360
don't just stand by and let it happen, understand&nbsp;
what's happening, push back, tell your friends

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.040
tell your family and take a stand because if
ordinary people allow the super rich to tax&nbsp;them

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.600
while they themselves often end up paying&nbsp;
rates of tax: 10%, 5%, even less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.280
then it's going to be a system where ordinary&nbsp;
people progressively lose their houses,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.240
lose their ability to make money and our next 
generation is&nbsp;going to be poor so yeah fight back 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.600
spread this message, share this video, tell&nbsp;your
friends, tell your family, don't let it happen

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.200
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.520
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:11.840
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
