00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
we're going to do one called what is money and&nbsp;
we're going to explain the concept of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.220
so people can understand it there are a lot of&nbsp;
misconceptions and misunderstandings about money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
uh we need to clear them up because if&nbsp;
you want to understand the current cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.520
of living crisis and also the massive increase&nbsp;
in inequality over covid you need to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.080
what money is so this is going to be super&nbsp;
important for the viewer to understand

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
very number one thing people need to&nbsp;
understand money is not real resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
um so lots of very wealthy people don't&nbsp;
actually have huge amounts of money they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.360
have largely real resources money is a&nbsp;
separate thing we're going to explain that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
now one of the reasons why money is confusing&nbsp;
is there are actually a couple of different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.500
ideas around what money is bouncing around and&nbsp;
the best way to explain that is I think to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.060
through an example so let's imagine I've&nbsp;
got 1 000 pounds and you've got nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.600
then I lend you for a week my one thousand&nbsp;
pounds how much money do you have then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.960
it's an interesting question right because on&nbsp;
the one hand you've got a thousand pounds in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.840
pocket that I just gave you but on the other hand&nbsp;
you have a debt of one thousand pounds to me right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.720
so you literally physically have one thousand&nbsp;
pounds but as an individual when you consider how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.300
much money you have you should also consider your&nbsp;
debts right so if we consider also your debts you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.540
you don't have any money you've got a thousand&nbsp;
pounds and a thousand pounds of debt but if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.360
just consider how much cash you have on hand&nbsp;
you have a thousand pounds the next question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.880
is how much money do I have so I've given you&nbsp;
all my money my one thousand pounds so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
could say I don't have any money but you owe me a&nbsp;
thousand pounds and I'm going to get it in a week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.200
so if we consider all of my money including&nbsp;
money owed to me I've got a thousand pounds

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.720
now most economists if they&nbsp;
looked at that situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
would say that once I've lent you a thousand&nbsp;
pounds we both have a thousand pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.480
that's interesting right so once the loan&nbsp;
is made the amount of money is doubled okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.760
and I think this captures the complication we&nbsp;
have with understanding what is money because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.420
some people would say if you have money but&nbsp;
you also have debt that you don't have money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.340
some people would say well if you have the money&nbsp;
it doesn't matter whether you have debt or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.780
some people would say well if you've lent the money&nbsp;
out you don't have money and some people would say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.060
well if you're gonna get.. if you have money owed&nbsp;
to you, you have money, basically is do I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.940
to have that cash in my pocket for it to be money?&nbsp;
do I need to have no debt for it to be money? &nbsp;

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.980
if I have somebody owing me money tomorrow do 
I have&nbsp;money and the reason this is complicated is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.120
most people's money is cash in the bank right&nbsp;
but actually when your money's in a bank account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.420
oh the bank doesn't actually have that money&nbsp;
in many cases that's money that they owe to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.380
so there's a complication here about whether we&nbsp;
should include debt and whether we should include&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.380
money that is owed to you and I'm going to argue&nbsp;
that yes we should include debt and yes we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.480
include money that is owed to you and in a way we&nbsp;
have to include money that is owed to you because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.800
any money you have in the bank account is money&nbsp;
that owed to you so essentially everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.340
ordinary people think of as money with the&nbsp;
exception of cash is money that is owed to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.800
so these are the fundamental problems&nbsp;
in understanding okay and we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
to run through it all so that everybody can&nbsp;
understand really clearly what is what okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.860
so the first thing I'm going&nbsp;
to say is as an individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.420
when I I ask you the question of how much&nbsp;
money do you have you should consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.200
all your cash most people don't actually keep that&nbsp;
much cash any money you have in the bank any money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.420
that you have owed to you and also any any debts&nbsp;
that you have that is your total situation with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:29.460
regards to money it doesn't really make sense if&nbsp;
you borrow a million pounds and you have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.360
that back in a year to say i'm a millionaire now you&nbsp;
have to include your debts it makes sense right

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.040
so as an individual you should include everything&nbsp;
so then why is it that economists don't do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.060
in order to understand that I think&nbsp;
we need to rewind a bit and go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.560
to the understanding of how money is created&nbsp;
because this is another story around which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.300
there's some confusion so for example there are a&nbsp;
lot of people who will tell say to you when a bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.740
lends you money they don't actually give you that&nbsp;
money they just create the money out of thin air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.260
um and I think that's quite&nbsp;
misleading and I will explain why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.580
the only people who are allowed to print&nbsp;
cash and create money out of thin air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.220
are the central banks so in this country (UK) the&nbsp;
Bank of England in the US is the Federal Reserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.760
In Europe it's the European Central Bank (the&nbsp;ECB)
okay these guys literally can create money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.940
nobody else can and we'll get later to&nbsp;
why people think not commercial Banks can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.280
and the.. but central banks are&nbsp;
not allowed to give money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.640
so then if they're the only guys who can create&nbsp;money 
but they can't give money out how do we have money?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.600
and the answer is they loan money out, they&nbsp;loan 
money out, central banks only ever make loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:08.040
so they create money they make loans to Commercial&nbsp;
Banks you know Lloyds Bank NatWest other banks are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.900
available um and then those Banks themselves&nbsp;
make loans so money gets loaned out but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.460
what what that means is quite interesting which&nbsp;
means that all money originates as a loan now

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.980
since if you loan one if you borrow&nbsp;
money you always have a debt with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.060
that means that whenever there is money there is&nbsp;
also debt that means that if I add up the total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.920
amount of money and the total amount of debt&nbsp;
in the economy it will always add up to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.860
now this is a fundamental truism of our money&nbsp;
system as it exists in in this country in Europe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.520
and the US in Australia most of the rich world&nbsp;
the total amount of money including the total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.720
amount of debt always is always zero is always&nbsp;
zero and that that is important to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.960
because if we know that then we also know that if&nbsp;
one group of people go into a mass amount of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:18.840
for example mortgage holders or the government&nbsp;
somebody else must be accumulating money or credit

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.720
that is really important to understand because&nbsp;
that is it was that fundamental understanding that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.980
enabled me at the beginning of covid to know that&nbsp;
okay well if the government is going to accumulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.520
£250 billion, £450 billion of debt somebody's&nbsp;
going to accumulate money elsewhere in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.620
system because we know that these two sides always&nbsp;
balance up it's basically an accounting equation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.000
okay so this is the fundamental truism of&nbsp;
monetary systems as they are at the moment that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.920
they always always add up to zero that's the&nbsp;
way that they're designed and that is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.880
money is always created by a loan and if the&nbsp;
only way to create money is to create debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.320
then these two things always aligned they're&nbsp;
always balanced so we know with 100% certainty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.420
that the amount of money plus the amount&nbsp;
of credit is equal to the amount of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:27.300
um now I've separated out there money and credit&nbsp;
when I say credit it means money you are owed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.660
um and I think for Simplicity it's probably&nbsp;
best to say that anything you have other than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.620
cash in your pocket is credit money having&nbsp;
the bank is money owed to you for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.420
and really it probably makes it easier to&nbsp;
understand the monetary system if you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.160
assume that everything is credit everything is..&nbsp;
it's just a balanced system of who owes money to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.940
who who owes money to it there's always a balanced&nbsp;
amount of credit and a balanced amount of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.800
fundamentally Whenever there is money&nbsp;
there is somebody who owes that money I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.100
went over there is debt there was somebody&nbsp;
that money is owed to it has the balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.740
now this is a little bit counter-intuitive&nbsp;
and it's the reason is because people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.440
think about money like that you know if you&nbsp;
have ten thousand pounds cash you know cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.160
in your pocket or cash in your bank you don't&nbsp;
think somebody else is 10 000 pounds in debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.380
you know you you as an individual can have&nbsp;
ten thousand pounds of cash without any debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.200
but it's not possible for society to have ten&nbsp;
thousand pounds of cash without debt because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.140
the way that the monetary system is designed is&nbsp;
that money is only ever created by the creation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.300
of debt so they are always balanced and on a&nbsp;
societal aggregate level they're always balanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:47.220
now then that raises it an interesting question&nbsp;
of well if the total amount of money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.800
is always zero does that mean the total of&nbsp;money 
is the amount of money in society is&nbsp;constant&nbsp;

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.140
what about things like QE? what about&nbsp;things 
like the Central Bank cutting interest&nbsp;rates?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.980
you know we hear at the central bank&nbsp;can 
change the amount of money in the system

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.860
and that is because what the central&nbsp;
bank can do is make more loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.760
so they can lend a lot of money into the system&nbsp;
so imagine imagine I'm a central bank and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.160
are the economy and I lend you a thousand pounds&nbsp;
you've got £1000 of cash and you have £1000 of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.520
you're balanced but then what&nbsp;I can do 
as a central bank is I can lend&nbsp;you another&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.660
ten thousand pounds now you've&nbsp;got
£11,000 of cash &amp; £11,000 of debt

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.580
you're still balanced,&nbsp;but there's 
more loans floating around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.060
once you think about money creation like&nbsp;
that you realize that in a sense anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.100
can do that, if you remember the example that&nbsp;
we had at the beginning of this discussion I&nbsp;said&nbsp;

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.200
well if I have a thousand pounds you have&nbsp;
nothing and then I'd lend you a thousand pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.820
in a way we've both got a thousand pounds, you&nbsp;
see what I'm saying? and this is worth sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:03.240
and thinking about because this explains to us the&nbsp;
two different understandings of what is money one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.520
of them says that whenever a new loan is created&nbsp;
both people have the money and that means Whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.860
there is lending money is being created and one of&nbsp;
them says no you have to include all of the debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.460
and all of the credit and in that sense the system&nbsp;
is always zero does that make sense now this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.840
this is not super simple but it's important to&nbsp;
understand and the difference between those two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.560
ways of understanding money are at the center&nbsp;
of so much argument of people on the internet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.720
and it's basically some people say that&nbsp;
it's some people thinking in the sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.980
you have to include all the debt in the system and&nbsp;
some people saying you have to include both sides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.840
so if I lend your money we both have the money&nbsp;
now if you if you and this is the way that most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.100
economists think about money they think when&nbsp;
I lend you money one thousand pounds now we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.720
both got a thousand pounds they think that&nbsp;
all money lending creates new money so if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.660
believe that all lending creates new money then&nbsp;
it is true that commercial Banks create money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.820
but they only create money by creating debt so&nbsp;
Commercial Banks cannot change the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.100
that the total amount of money always equals&nbsp;
the total amount of debt they cannot change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.240
that and in fact nobody can change that that is&nbsp;
a part of the design of the system the monetary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:31.380
system in Western economies in Britain in the&nbsp;US 
but because Commercial Banks can make loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:39.300
some people say Commercial Banks can create money&nbsp;
and it is true that say you went to Lloyd's Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.660
and you say I want to borrow a million pounds&nbsp;
and they they accept your loan they will simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.980
credit your bank with a million your account with&nbsp;
a million pounds that is true and you might think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.180
oh they've created money but as soon as you&nbsp;
try and spend that million pounds they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:00.480
to actually pay it out of the money that they have&nbsp;
it's a little bit like if I said to you I've got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.260
thousand pounds and I say I'm going to lend you&nbsp;
a thousand pounds but I'm going to keep it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.080
account for you and you say okay fine okay you've&nbsp;
got this account one thousand pounds and of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.240
I can just write that account and say you simran&nbsp;
1 000 pounds it's on the account I've just created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.480
money but as soon as you take the money out I&nbsp;
have to give it to you you see what I'm saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.820
I haven't actually created any money all I've&nbsp;
said is if you want the money you can have it so

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.320
I I hopefully that captures the situation here&nbsp;
the only people you can actually create money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.580
of the Central Bank the only way&nbsp;
they inject that into the system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.640
is by making loans that means that within the&nbsp;
economy money always balances perfectly debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.780
by anyone including central banks including&nbsp;
individuals can make loans and when loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.700
are made that means essentially many people&nbsp;
are accessing the same money I'm saying like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.880
I've got a thousand pounds but if you want to&nbsp;
use it you can use it we can both use the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.240
thousand pounds but it doesn't take that balance&nbsp;
out of the system money is always equal to debt so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:12.120
that raises a question right if central banks&nbsp;
can only lend money they can't give money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.600
then who can give money into the economy&nbsp;
and the answer is really anybody can give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.900
money into the economy if I borrow&nbsp;
money from you and then give it away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.620
then I'm in debt and since you know that&nbsp;
debt equals money if I go into debt then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.700
the rest of the system has positive money&nbsp;
you see what I'm saying that makes sense but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.920
what the power the government has is they can&nbsp;
borrow enormous amounts of money and give it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.300
and then what that does is it in a sense&nbsp;
puts the rest of the system out of balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.920
it means that the rest of the system&nbsp;
is suddenly no longer adding up to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.880
so since the beginning of Covid the government&nbsp;
has increased its debt by £700 billion pound!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.820
and since we know that the system as a whole debt&nbsp;
always equals total money we know that the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.000
of the individuals in the game have have that 700&nbsp;
billion pounds they must have 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.700
so we know that the average UK adult because it's&nbsp;
about 50 million UK adults must have an extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.320
fourteen thousand pounds since the beginning&nbsp;
of Covid we know these things with certainty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.720
and it's just a question of who has that money&nbsp;
it's just a question of who has that money so

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.860
then this sort of brings us onto other questions&nbsp;like 
what is QE? what does the Central Bank do? I&nbsp;think&nbsp;

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:33.900
we'll go into it in future videos but to&nbsp;summarise 
at its heart money is a loan from the central&nbsp;bank

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.920
and then that circulates throughout&nbsp;the economy 
some people go into debt which&nbsp;means other&nbsp;

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.040
people go into credit, the total&nbsp;amount of debt
always equals the total amount&nbsp;of credit

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.180
so we know for example the average UK&nbsp;adult 
has.. was it 30 000 pounds of Mortgage Debt?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.400
yeah, we did that in the debt video, so we 
know that the average UK adult must have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.740
£30,000 of mortgage credit, we know that&nbsp;the
government has increased its debt by £14,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:04.000
£14,000 per adult so we know&nbsp;the average UK 
adult has increased their credit by £14,000

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.780
and hopefully I'm communicating that&nbsp;there 
are these two different conceptions of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.680
one of which includes all debt, includes&nbsp;
all credit and always adds up to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.920
and one of which is about total amount of loans&nbsp;
in the system they're both important if there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.660
loads and loads of loans in the system, what&nbsp;
happens is the interest rate will fall but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:30.000
not the same as the government going into debt
and giving huge amounts of money out basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.040
the central bank can lend money and that brings&nbsp;
interest rates down but the government can give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.680
money and that causes cash accumulation amongst&nbsp;
individuals since the beginning of Covid-19&nbsp;the 

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.300
government has increases that by £700 billion we&nbsp;
know that cash has accumulated amongst individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.920
um it's not the same as QE right there's two&nbsp;
things happening here QE is another form of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.700
Central Bank lending it's more loans in the&nbsp;
system I think we'll do that in the next video QE&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.720
this 700 billion pounds is not QE, this is the&nbsp;
total amount of government debt accumulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.120
since Covid, it's money that the government&nbsp;
has either printed or borrowed and given out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.760
but either way if I print money and give it to you&nbsp;
you have more money if I borrow money from you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.840
give it to you you have more money because money&nbsp;
and money owed to you are very similar things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.500
if I borrow money give it back to you have&nbsp;
the money and you have the money owed to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.780
so did you think that's clear? *yeah* so I think&nbsp;
that's this is the key thing I want people to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:36.600
understand um money is it's a balanced&nbsp;
system it's really it's a balance point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.880
system we know it some people are in debt some&nbsp;
people are are in credit if you have mortgage&nbsp;debt&nbsp;

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.360
somebody has credit, if the government&nbsp;
is in debt somebody has credit and it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.560
system of owes money to who and of course the&nbsp;
people who are in debt constantly need to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.860
ways to get that money from the people who are in&nbsp;
credit otherwise they can't pay their debts back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.420
so really it's a points-based system it's&nbsp;
perfectly balanced throughout Society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.320
but the problem is in many cases it is a small&nbsp;
amount of very wealth people who are on credit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.160
and it's the government and a large amount of&nbsp;
mortgage holding individuals who are in debt so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.360
it creates an imbalance and the people who are&nbsp;
in debt such as the government which means the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.040
taxpayer and families who have mortgages have&nbsp;
to constantly find money to pay to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:25.020
but that's it money is a balanced system, comes&nbsp;
from the central bank, commercial banks they can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.420
create money but they can create loans and if&nbsp;
you create loans it in some sense it seems like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.080
more money being made because people have money&nbsp;
even though they have debt against it have access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.960
to money um but crucially what is most important&nbsp;
for this channel for the message of this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.400
that's 700 billion pounds is the increase&nbsp;
in government debt which means we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.400
there has been an increase in private&nbsp;holding of 
money to the extent of £14,000&nbsp;for every adult

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.500
in the country, which&nbsp;is increasing 
in most cases that money is sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.680
in the bank accounts of wealthy individuals&nbsp;
which means your average wealth individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.400
has accumulated £100,000-£200,000 
extra cash&nbsp;since the beginning of Covid

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.100
this is not per household, it's per adult right so it 
really&nbsp;is a huge amount of money and it's... this

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.780
is not money they've borrowed it's money they've&nbsp;
essentially been given ultimately from government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.540
and this is how it was very easy to predict at&nbsp;
the very beginning of Covid that there would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.340
a massive increase in in asset prices and&nbsp;
I think what's quite interesting is now so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:32.040
we're filming this in the in the middle of January&nbsp;
last week both the gold price and the stock price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.640
the FTSE-100 (UK share index) came within &nbsp;
1% of a new all-time high and that's interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.220
because economists and traders will normally say&nbsp;
gold goes up when the economy is weak and stocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.680
go up when the economy is strong but both of these&nbsp;
things have gone up massively and I predicted this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.940
at the beginning of Covid and in my opinion the&nbsp;
reason for that is the government has given out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.220
a huge amount of money that has ended up 
being&nbsp;held by rich individuals.. it's hundreds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.620
thousands of pounds for every rich individual they&nbsp;
tend to buy assets you know they buy all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.440
assets they'll buy stocks and property and gold&nbsp;
so all asset prices go up doesn't matter whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.080
the economy is bad or good; simply because these&nbsp;
guys have so much money, the flip side of it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.580
the government is in a huge amount of debt, partially&nbsp;
that's QE funded we'll do that in the next video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.700
but they have to pay interest to the rich every&nbsp;
single month and for that reason that is why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.700
they're saying we can't afford to do things and&nbsp;
both of these things have consequences the debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.620
of the government hurts public services and&nbsp;
it hurts public sector pay creates austerity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.560
but the credit of the rich pushes up asset&nbsp;
prices and it pushes up other prices too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.380
um this relates to the thing we said at the very&nbsp;
beginning of this video which is money is not real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.020
resources so ultimately money is a token that&nbsp;
you use to buy real resources so if these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.740
the rich have a ton of money now they're going to&nbsp;
buy more stuff they're going to push the price up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.720
and you the ordinary person of this country will&nbsp;
get less stuff so um this amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.020
£700 billion is unbelievably large, from the very&nbsp;
beginning of Covid I've said it will overwhelm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.700
basically all other economic effects until it is&nbsp;
resolved, it won't be resolved, it doesn't look it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.140
going to be resolved, so the end result is prices&nbsp;
will will stay high they won't come back down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.100
especially asset prices will continue to rise&nbsp;
and living stands will continue to fall so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.260
that's the video what is money a little&nbsp;
bit complicated but it's something that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.680
important for people to understand if they want&nbsp;
to understand what's happening with the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.640
we're going to do more explanatory&nbsp;
videos but the key message here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.760
the government has gone enormously into debt that&nbsp;
means somebody has increased their money holding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.740
my analysis says it's overwhelmingly the rich&nbsp;
that increases inequality that increases asset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.800
prices and price in the shops and it&nbsp;decreases 
living standards for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.160
okay so there's one point I want to add on&nbsp;
money which I think is very important for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:03.840
people to understand which is I think one common&nbsp;
incorrect way that people conceptualise money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:12.480
is they think about as if it is a finite resource&nbsp;
so imagine I had like a pile of firewood okay and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.280
then I burned the firewood bit by bit over the&nbsp;
course of a month and there's no firewood left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.960
and then there's no fire but we need to go get&nbsp;
some more firewood people think about money as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.200
if it's like that, because on the perspective&nbsp;
of an individual it kind of is like that if&nbsp;you&nbsp;

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.600
spend all your money then money, money runs&nbsp;
out but and then for example during covid the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.500
government spent a lot of money so then this is&nbsp;
kind of perceptional the government spent a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.800
of money we've run out of firewood we all need to&nbsp;
be poor now, there's nothing we can do, but money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.440
always adds up to zero, always adds up to zero, 
money&nbsp;from perspective of society cannot run out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.000
it can only pass from person to&nbsp;
person it can only be held so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.120
if the government has accumulated a huge&nbsp;
amount of debt all that means is some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.100
other group of society has gotten rich and it&nbsp;
doesn't mean that we as a society have lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:07.680
our resources it's very very important to&nbsp;
understand that money is not real resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:14.520
money is I think I described in another video as a&nbsp;
competitive resource or a distributional resource&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.180
money is only used to determine who gets the real&nbsp;
resources and if you have lost a load of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.760
that can only be because somebody else has gotten&nbsp;
a load of money because we know with guaranteed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.600
certainty the total amount adds up to zero and I&nbsp;
think this idea that money we've run out of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:42.060
I mean it was it's really powerful in politics you&nbsp;
know the big thing is after 2010 when the labour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.940
government was voted out and the conservative&nbsp;
government was voted in there's this we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.140
run out of money because there's no more money&nbsp;
there's no more money and it's totally impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:57.000
and because money is only a distributional&nbsp;
resource we know that if a problem can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.440
fixed by distribution of money we know that that&nbsp;
problem can only been a distributional problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.000
you cannot fix a lack of resources with&nbsp;
money it's not possible because money is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.100
not resources and money cannot create resources&nbsp;
if you have if you don't have enough energy you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.520
need to go and get some more energy you know&nbsp;
you need to get some more coal or some more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.180
wind power or some more firewood whatever you're&nbsp;
using for energy you can't make out of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.840
um but I think this is It's been used powerfully&nbsp;
against the labour party I think they've said

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.720
you know "they spent all the money" but it's actually&nbsp;
quite powerful to understand that money can never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.880
run out; resources can run out and you know&nbsp;
there may be instances you know for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.960
this year just gone we've seen there's been&nbsp;
less energy and the energy price has gone&nbsp;up&nbsp;

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.580
resources can run out but money can never&nbsp;run
out the government can never run out of&nbsp;money

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.000
if the government has run out of money, somebody 
has that money, if the government has&nbsp;&nbsp;gone into debt

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.640
somebody has that debt there, it's really 
important to understand money.. you as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.860
individual can run out of money but society can&nbsp;
never run out of money and if the government has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:07.860
gone into debt it is because somebody has&nbsp;
accumulated money; it's always in balance

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:17.100
money currently is flowing from the government&nbsp;
to the rich leaving government with big powers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.520
of debt and the rich would be part&nbsp;
of money there's one other thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.300
they can do with that mass amount of&nbsp;
income they can buy your mom's house
