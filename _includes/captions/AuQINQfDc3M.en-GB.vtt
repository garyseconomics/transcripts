00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Okay.

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.240
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.920
This week

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.640
I want to do something a little bit different,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.720
which is to talk about

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.640
a discussion

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.040
which has been causing a lot of disagreements

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.240
here in Garys Economics offices, which is,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.160
largely this kitchen and a WhatsApp group.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600
Recently we got contacted

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
by the Labour Party, basically,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.280
which is the first time

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.720
we've ever been contacted by the Labour Party.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.920
And, they said,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.480
you know, we've been seeing

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.760
what you've been doing on the channel

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.000
and we would like to send some MPs

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
onto the channel to talk to you about,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.560
presumably the economy.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.280
And my initial instinct

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.760
when that happens was that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.720
we have to let them on basically,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.520
that was a kind of a,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.080
I think, a moral like a, like an ethical response

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.120
because we criticise the government a lot.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.000
Labour have been in government

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for coming up to a year now.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.640
We've criticised them a lot, before them

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.600
we criticised the Conservatives a lot.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.320
But I felt that since we are criticising

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.880
these guys

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.920
a lot on the channel,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.760
we kind of have kind of an obligation

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.120
to let them come on and defend themselves.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.640
They are literally the party of government

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.320
in this country.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.440
I think I might even have said on the channel,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.640
you know, if you want to come on,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.560
we'll have you on,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.440
so I felt like we kind of

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.360
have to have them on, really, from a moral perspective.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
So I chucked it out there to the team,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.920
we have like a very small team now

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.160
we have Jack, here the videographer,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.200
and we have Oscar, who's the channel manager.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.360
And I said, these guys want to come on the channel,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.400
I think we have to have them on.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.840
And we had a little chat about it.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.680
And basically, Oscar thinks we shouldn't have them on.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.920
I think Jack probably thinks we shouldn't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.840
have them either.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.600
So I wanted to basically talk about

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.880
what's going on in my head,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.760
what's going on in our discussions

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.600
about whether we should have them on.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.160
And basically,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.840
I wanted to put it to you guys,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.920
the viewers, to basically let you guys

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.800
have your say about

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800
whether you think we should have them on.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.480
And I wanted to engage you guys in the thought process.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.720
Yeah and just

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.400
encourage you to put in the comments what you think.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.560
So I'm going to kind of go through the pros

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560
and the cons as I see them.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.600
So firstly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.840
the pros, I think it's kind of the right thing to do,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.440
to have them on

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.280
because as I say, we've been criticising them

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.200
and they're the party of government

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.080
and we kind of

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.200
should give them like a right

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.320
to reply to defend themselves.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.920
Other pros,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.680
look, I'll be clear about what I'm doing here.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.120
You know, this is obviously a YouTube channel,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.000
but those of you who've been watching for a long time,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
you will probably be aware that,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.280
you know, I'm not just doing this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.520
YouTube channel to make videos.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.280
I want to achieve political change here.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.920
You know, I want to achieve a fairer tax system

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.120
which taxes

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.200
the very rich more and taxes ordinary working

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.800
people less.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.520
I want to stop increasing inequality.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.720
I want to try to stop falling living standards.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.360
You know, and everything, the writing of the book,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.200
it's all about trying to achieve political change.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.960
And i’ll be very clear, like plan A for me,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.000
and I think I've said this on the channel before,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.520
is to try to influence the Labour Party

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.960
running up into the next election.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.680
I think that they will fail on the economy.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.360
I think that living standards will continue to decline.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.040
I think that Labour and Keir

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.000
Starmer will become increasingly unpopular

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.840
because of that,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840
and I think they will be forced to,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.360
if not replace Keir Starmer, at the very least

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.520
do a significant rebrand on economic policy.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.760
And I think they will be forced

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.800
to consider a new direction

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.160
to consider, at the very least,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.600
a new style of messaging.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.800
But I think they will be forced to listen to new ideas.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.960
And, I think that

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.440
if we can keep growing the channel at the kind of pace

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.200
we have been growing the channel,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.360
I think that we

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.560
can be big enough

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.800
and can be powerful enough that we maybe can influence

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.160
that changing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.600
economic direction for the party,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000
which will probably come in two years

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.600
time, three years time leading into the election.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.800
That might sound crazy,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.080
but the growth of the channel

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.880
is so quick at the moment,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.240
and the growth in support is so quick,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.240
I actually think that that is achievable.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.120
But that obviously means

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.080
building some form of connection

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.200
with Labour and some form of influence in Labour.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.600
I'll be clear about that.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.520
I'm not trying to sort of

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.840
covertly become a member of the Labour Party.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.000
My priority,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.960
my plan is to make this channel so big

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.720
that they basically have to talk to us,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.760
whether they like us or not.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.160
I call this the Rupert Murdoch plan.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.000
So Rupert Murdoch,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.320
for those who don't know who he is, is

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.840
one of the richest men in the world.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.160
He's an Australian media businessman.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.640
He owns loads of newspapers.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.120
And really,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.720
he kind of indirectly controls

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.560
politics in a lot of countries, including the UK,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.200
because he has so much influence

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.160
over the public through his newspapers

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.480
and his TV channels

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.480
that unless prime ministers get his support,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.920
they basically can't win elections.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.040
And I think I'm not wrong in saying,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.000
wasn't he godson to Tony Blair's kid?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.640
I think he...

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.560
double check me on that.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.760
But,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.960
you know,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.840
I think one of the reasons Tony Blair was so successful

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.880
politically is because he got Rupert

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.960
Murdoch's support, basically.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.800
And I think Rupert Murdoch is a great example

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.640
of how you don't need to be an MP or even prime

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.040
minister directly to completely control

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.000
politics, basically.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.920
He is, he was? Yeah, yeah so I'm not wrong on this.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.160
-Tony Blair Godfather to Rupert Murdock’s daughter.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.520
Okay.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.120
Tony Blair Godfather to Rupert Murdock’s daughter.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.760
Okay, so they were close basically.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.600
I think Rupert Murdoch shows you that

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.640
if you have a big enough media presence,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.760
you can basically boss the political parties around.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.080
And that's my plan A, basically.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.200
The growth on this channel

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.560
is unbelievably quick at the moment.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560
I don't know whether we'll be able

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760
to keep up that level of speed,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.680
but to be honest, you know,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.440
we're going to try to get some big media hits.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.040
You know,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.560
Diary of a CEO, Question Time, The Rest Is Politics.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.200
Maybe we can keep growing at this pace.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.760
And if we do

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.400
yeah then Labour will have to listen to us.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.760
But either way if I don't want to set up

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.400
a political party myself,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.120
which, trust me, I don't,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.880
I think our best chance of influencing policy is

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.040
via the Labour Party. So,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.280
obviously having them on is

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.880
a way to try to develop some sort of relationship.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.160
Which I guess brings us onto the negatives,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.880
because one of the obvious negatives is,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.960
I am very, very critical of Labour

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.800
Party policy at the moment.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.960
I think it will fail economically.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.400
And if somebody comes on, I will say that.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.760
And, you know, I'm not going to have them on

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.440
and be a soft touch, like I'm going to try to...

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.400
I'm going to tell them

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.920
that I think their policy will fail,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.640
and I'm going to try to...

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.280
if they,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.640
if they're unwilling to listen to that,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.080
then I'll probably have to go for them

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.960
quite aggressively.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.120
And there is a risk that we perhaps

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.680
sour the relationship with the Labour Party,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.520
which might be problematic down the line. I don't know.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.480
I want to be clear, I keep saying that,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.240
I don't have a background in politics.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.720
My background is in economics,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.480
and I'm not a professional lobbyer.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.480
I really don't know how this works.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.520
My plan for a long time

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.080
has been to build

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.320
popularity with the public,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.120
and it's only really

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.080
now the channel is growing

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.000
that I'm even starting to think about, okay,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.480
how are we going to be able to leverage

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.120
this into political power down the line?

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.680
But yeah, that's one of the risks.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.520
Number one is, you know,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.360
we might potentially sour relations

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.240
with the Labour Party,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.560
which might possibly influence

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.240
our ability to influence them,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.960
affect our ability to implement them down the line,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.400
which could be a problem.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.800
To be honest,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.480
I think if we get this channel big enough,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.000
I don't think that'll be a problem,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.080
because I think if we're big enough,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.000
they have to listen.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.960
But, you know,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.240
maybe it is,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.160
maybe you guys know more than me

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.040
about the Labour Party,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.880
I'm not an expert, I'm not a member.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.680
The second thing is,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.080
it risks people

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.000
questioning the political neutrality of me

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.920
and the channel.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.200
So I come into this as an economist.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200
I consider what I'm doing

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.640
kind of a single issue campaign.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.800
We need to stop wealth inequality increasing,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.960
that's how we stop poverty from exploding.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.160
I honestly don't consider myself

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
to be particularly politically factional.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.680
I voted for a number of different political parties

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.560
over the course of my life.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.160
But obviously,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.880
if we let the Labour Party

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.200
on, there might be people that say,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.160
“Oh, Gary's let the Labour Party on, he's

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.280
a Labour Party stooge.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.160
He's on the left.” I think we have to accept we live in

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.480
increasingly, extremely

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.920
factional times with regard

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.480
to politics,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.160
where people who feel that

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.120
they're on the right often

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.680
hate people who are on the left,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.160
people who feel that they're on the left,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.200
often hate people who are on the right.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.160
And

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.960
I

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.200
I want to appeal to people

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.280
in both camps on either camp.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.440
I honestly believe that

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.440
we're not politically factional,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.480
and I want to be able

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.040
to remain believably politically non factional.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.880
And that might be a risk if we have Labour on.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.960
I would be bringing Labour on

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.360
because they are literally the party in government and

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.800
I criticise them a lot.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800
And I would have had the Conservatives

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.720
on when they were in government and,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.160
you know,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.000
I'd be open to having the Conservatives on

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.400
now if we had Labour on, but that's a risk

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.160
we might be seen as nonpolitical, factional,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.440
we might be seen as, yeah, not politically neutral.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.080
Then after that,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.720
if we have Labour on in order to,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.280
you know, defend and justify

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.840
that we are politically neutral, which I think that

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.280
we are,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.760
we might need to have

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.120
the Conservatives on, we might need to have Reform on.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.640
And some people might say

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.600
we should even have the Liberal Democrats on,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.680
and we should even have the Greens on,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.840
and we should the SNP on.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.120
And then it starts to become a situation

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.440
where we are giving up

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.960
a significant amount of our time

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.200
to basically other people when, primarily this is a...

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.800
I want this channel to be

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.360
an educational channel, an informative channel.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.880
I work hard to put out

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.680
informative educational videos

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.040
every week that help ordinary people understand

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.960
what is happening.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.000
And we only do one video a week.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.760
It takes up a lot of my time.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.720
It takes up a lot of my energy.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.440
It takes up a lot of our resources.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.400
We don't really want to start

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.000
giving up a huge amount of basically this space

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.040
we've created to a bunch of politicians

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.560
who we don't really trust or even really

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.680
like necessarily.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.520
So that's the second question.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.000
Is it going to sort of

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.280
start us on a slippery slope

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.840
of having to give a lot of our time and space,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.400
which we've worked hard to create, to people

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.240
that we don't really like,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.440
people that we don't support.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.280
And I don't mean that just Reform

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.640
and Conservatives, I include Labour in that,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.840
because there are a lot of people in Labour

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.160
that maybe I'm not a massive fan of.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.600
And then the next problem, potential problem

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.520
after this is quite simply

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.760
that it might just be really boring, it’s

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.280
I think a very real risks.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.760
So, I mentioned message

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.640
discipline in my video last week.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.720
One of the reasons why MPs are often quite boring

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.480
when they go on TV

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.280
is because they get told what to say by the party.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.080
That's the way that it works,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.560
party tells them what to say,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560
they don't have a huge amount of freedom.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.720
And there's a very real risk

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
that we allow someone on the channel,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.360
he sits here with me at the kitchen table.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.800
He or she obviously, could be a woman.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.080
And it's just really, really boring.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.160
And it's just talking,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.640
just speaking the talking points

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.920
they've been told to say.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.520
They're not really thinking about the economy,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.520
they're not really listening.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.720
And it could just be really rubbish

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.160
TV, could just be really rubbish video.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.320
That is a risk.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.960
And I take pride in putting out good,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.800
interesting videos on the channel.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.920
People have their opinions on

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.520
whether they're good or interesting,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.000
I think we produce good content.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.440
And I've always believed that

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.240
it's really important to produce

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.120
good, interesting content,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.160
and that is a risk

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.920
when we bring them on that it’s just boring,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.600
boring content.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.960
And then

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.720
to, you know,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.520
then we're forced to bring on Reform and Conservatives,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.320
and we just get a string of boring videos

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.240
and we become Garys Economics, political...

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.440
boring political broadcasts,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.080
which is obviously not what we want to be.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.640
And the next risk is just,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:39.880
you know,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.520
I am obviously not a professional interviewer.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.920
I'm an economist.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.840
We've done interviews on the channel, we've only had...

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.800
we've only ever had three guests

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.840
on the channel, Matt Zarb-Cousin,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.960
Stephanie Brobbey, and Jimmy the Giant,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.760
all three people that I really like,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.840
I really respect, I really respect their work.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.320
But even so, you know,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.440
people sometimes criticise

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.600
those videos and say, “Oh, Gary,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.880
you're not a good interviewer.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.760
You need to give the guest on to speak.”

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.640
And I think they're probably right.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.480
I'm not a professional interviewer. It's not my job.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.800
I would have to sort of sit

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.720
and think quite long and hard about,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.360
you know, what do I would ask these people?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.720
How do I want to run it?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.120
How are we going to manage it if they're boring

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.920
and they don't say anything?

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.680
So it's just a lot of stuff for me to think about.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.320
You know,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.520
if I go too soft on them, people might say, “Oh, Gary,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.560
you secretly support Labour.”

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.760
If I go too hard on them, people might say, “Oh, Gary,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.120
you hate Labour.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.800
You're on the right.” We might sour our abilities to

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.120
influence them down the line.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.920
So yeah, that's basically it really.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.640
We're throwing around a lot of ideas.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.560
I think if I was thinking

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.960
purely explicitly about

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.280
like what is best for the YouTube channel,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.120
probably I wouldn't have them on.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.320
I think we, I think we've got a cool channel here.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.480
I think we make great videos.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.520
I think we make

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.240
we make fun, exciting,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.600
accessible, educational, informative videos.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.280
People like it.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.480
We're growing really quickly, we're popular.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.920
Everybody hates Labour,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.640
I think they’re going to do quite a bad job.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.880
Their brand is weak.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.360
It's kind of toxic.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.960
It's like, purely

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.400
from a growing the channel perspective,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.120
it seems like an unnecessary risk.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.880
But at the same time,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.640
I think

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.720
and I'm kind of a lone voice in this in our team,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.440
I think it's the right thing to do.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.360
We attack them, we criticise them.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.400
I think it’s the right thing to do.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.880
These guys are literally

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.480
the government of this country.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.960
Even if we don't have other parties on.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.880
I think we have a

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.960
kind of a duty

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.240
to let them come on and defend themselves.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.080
But no decision has been made.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.360
I'm crazy, crazy busy,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.160
and I haven't had a real chance to sit

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.800
and think it through.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.680
So I thought we’d

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.560
try something different,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720
which is to just discuss here on camera

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.440
in front of you guys

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.200
what we're thinking,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.640
what I'm thinking, and ask

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.240
you guys for your opinions, basically.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.280
So, what do you think?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.680
Should we have them on? What are the risks?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.680
If we have them on, does that mean

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.440
we have to have on the Conservatives,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.320
and Reform, the Liberal Democrats? What do you think?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.560
Or is it a waste of our time

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.400
and we should just keep making the videos?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.080
Of course, you know,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.760
I can go back to these guys and say, hey, look,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.040
I want to talk to you.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.720
And I can sort of ask for, look,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.200
if you want to come on the channel,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.800
I need you to come and talk to me about...

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.000
are you going to give me what I want?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.040
Are you going to be open to things like

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.280
wealth taxes, like a fairer tax system,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.040
like raising tax on wealth and lowering tax on work?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.400
So, you know, that is another option.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.320
We can turn around and say,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.280
“Yeah, we'll have you on the channel,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.000
if you give us what we want, which is,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
you know, a little bit more access to your policymakers

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480
telling us how you make your policy.”

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.560
Lots of options here.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.320
I have no background in political lobbying.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.040
I'm not really comfortable in this space.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.840
I'm an economist at the end of the day, so be nice.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.360
No decisions have been made,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.960
but let us know what you think.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.680
Yeah, put it in the comments.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.440
We'll be watching, we'll be reading.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.160
And that's all.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.960
Well, I should say

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.440
the reason that we're

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.240
getting these kind of approaches from Labour

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.440
is because the channel is growing

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.400
unbelievably quickly, and that is

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400
thanks to you, the viewers.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.680
So I'd like to thank everyone

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.720
who watches the channel, shares

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.520
the channel, everybody who has bought the book

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.000
shared, the book.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.600
The book at the time I'm speaking, the book’s

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.000
been five weeks at number one.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.920
This is one of the reasons why we get these approaches.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.560
Yeah, this is something that shows we are

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.320
getting a bit of political power,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.120
and if we keep growing, we could get more,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.760
but we haven't yet decided what the best way

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.080
is to play it, to approach it.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.160
So let us know your opinions, put them in the comments.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.880
Thanks for your support and keep watching. Thank you.
