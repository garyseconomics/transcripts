00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.040
so i want to do a video about the government&nbsp;
debt and government cuts because recently i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.560
did an interview on the radio where they said&nbsp;
that we can't afford TFL we have to close the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.920
Bakerloo line we can't afford obviously the train&nbsp;
to Leeds that's been cancelled and we can't afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.080
the cost of the NHS then we can't afford the cost&nbsp;
of social care and the reason given for this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.840
because the government debt has increased now&nbsp;
i would encourage anyone who hasn't watched it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.120
to watch the first video on this channel which&nbsp;
is about the finances of Covid-19 because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.080
government debt increased massively during Covid
19 but the government printed that money and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.480
was given out and ended up sitting in the bank&nbsp;
account of wealthy individuals so whilst the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.200
government debt has increased by £450 billion&nbsp;
billionaire wealth has increased by £106billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.600
which is a quarter of the amount and the&nbsp;
rest is being held by wealthy individuals so i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.200
want people to remember that that government debt&nbsp;
is not to nobody it is to the wealthy individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.200
of this country and there has been an equivalent&nbsp;
increase in the wealth of wealthy individuals now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.120
if you watch that video the finance of Covid-19&nbsp;
you'll see a year and a half ago i predicted that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.520
there'd be a massive increase in billionaire and&nbsp;
wealthy individual wealth that would push up house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.800
prices and it would push up inflation and push up&nbsp;
the government debt it's exactly what has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.160
and what i said at the time was that may be used&nbsp;
to justify cutting services for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.400
and raising taxes on ordinary people&nbsp;
which is again exactly what has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.640
taxes on ordinary people have been raised&nbsp;
so what i want you to do is to connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.800
the government debt to the increased wealth of&nbsp;
wealthy individuals we talk about this in the what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.520
is wealth video that the debt of the government is&nbsp;
also the wealth of wealthy individuals so what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.440
have had here is covered has essentially been used&nbsp;
to increase government debt but also make the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.040
enormously richer it has been the biggest ever in&nbsp;
all of history single year increase in billionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.040
and super rich wealth and what this means is&nbsp;
all of these things we're told we can't afford&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.480
it's only because the government has transferred&nbsp;
an enormous amount of wealth to the richest in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.240
our society if we tax that wealth back we can&nbsp;
afford all the things that we as a society need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.360
if we don't tax it back then number one we&nbsp;
can't afford those things and number two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.040
ordinary people like you will have to pay more&nbsp;
taxes from your salaries and what we see now is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.360
the chancellor who is a billionaire cutting tax on&nbsp;
billionaires raising tax on ordinary people making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.320
billionaire wealth increase by more than it's&nbsp;
ever increased in the past and at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.800
raising your taxes so the main thing&nbsp;
to understand here the debt of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
government has only increased by as much as&nbsp;
the wealth of the super rich has increased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.360
we can get that back if we choose to tax&nbsp;
the richest and if we don't then we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.840
and it will have to be taxed on the rest of&nbsp;
us and cuts to our services. happy with that? 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.240
but poorer families will be forced&nbsp;
to lose almost all of the assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.320
including their home we have a tax system which is&nbsp;
very efficient attacking ordinary working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.720
but very inefficient attacks in the super rich
