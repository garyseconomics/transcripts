00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome back to Gary's Economics, today we're&nbsp;
going to talk about Liz Truss's energy plan

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.760
okay so we're filming this on thursday&nbsp;
morning the plan has just come out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.480
the plan is to cap energy bills such that the&nbsp;
average household would pay £2,500 a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.120
and that is going to cost the government&nbsp;
it looks like about £150,000,000,000 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.840
that's going to be funded from the looks&nbsp;
of it by government spending all right so

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.000
i've got some big concerns&nbsp;
about this plan and i think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.680
it's really interesting i think we can learn a lot&nbsp;
by talking about it so the first thing to say is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.000
obviously the situation is basically a disaster&nbsp;
and it's absolutely essential that some support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.840
is provided so it's good that support is there&nbsp;
uh the problem is the way that the support is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.040
designed okay so i think the most interesting&nbsp;
thing to comment on here is we are making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.760
basically exactly the same mistake that we&nbsp;
made during Covid with regards to the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.080
again so in Covid the government gave out a huge&nbsp;
amount of money and that money basically all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.480
ended up with richer people which meant that by&nbsp;
the end of Covid your average rich person had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.240
accumulated more than a £100,000&nbsp;cash
and i was saying from the beginning of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
but if you do this if you allow a huge amount&nbsp;
of money to go from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
then afterwards you will get a massive increase&nbsp;
in inequality a massive increase in inflation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.160
essentially a costly living crisis which we&nbsp;
had um and then we had the cost of living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.880
crisis right so if you haven't yet watched it&nbsp;
i would encourage you to go back and re-watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.760
the first video on this channel which talks&nbsp;
about how Covid is making the rich richer that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.400
goes through really clearly the simple question of&nbsp;
if the government is giving a huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.360
who's going to get it explaining how it's the&nbsp;
rich and then talking about what does it mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.640
if the rich accumulate a huge amount of cash&nbsp;
because this energy crisis is basically being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.440
dealt with in exactly the same way which is the&nbsp;
government is giving a huge amount of money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.880
and obviously people are happy because that's&nbsp;
supporting their energy bills but the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.400
ends up with richer people so the end result will&nbsp;
be a massive increase in inequality so in&nbsp;Covid&nbsp;

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.080
they gave out by the end £600,000,000,000&nbsp;
which was about £13,000 for every&nbsp;adult&nbsp;

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.440
in the country that all went to the rich&nbsp;and here
they're giving out another £150,000,000,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.520
pounds which is another about £4,000 for&nbsp;
every adult in the country and that again in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.200
this case is going basically directly to Energy&nbsp;
Companies and it's really important to realise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.000
when money goes out and it goes to Energy&nbsp;
Companies the money doesn't disappear that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.160
will be held by the Energy Companies it will be&nbsp;
paid out as dividends to shareholders of Energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.800
Companies which are richer people and what we'll&nbsp;
see here is another massive accumulation of cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.880
to richer people um now i've been saying from the&nbsp;
beginning of Covid if you allow rich people to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.320
accumulate cash that will push prices up and now&nbsp;
we've seen a situation where that has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.240
prices have gone up and we're responding by giving&nbsp;
the rich another massive chunk of cash and i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.680
there's a real danger here that we start to get&nbsp;
into a cycle of we have a crisis we give the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.320
a ton of money and it truly was a huge amount&nbsp;
of money that we gave them during Covid that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.440
understandably pushes up prices and pushes&nbsp;
down living conditions for ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.320
and then we respond by giving the rich another ton&nbsp;
of money which will probably push prices up again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.120
which will mean we'll have to respond&nbsp;
again by giving the rich a ton of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.680
it's a really dangerous cycle and you know&nbsp;
if anyone is a student of economic history&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.160
they will be aware that this has&nbsp;
happened before in the downfall of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.360
most big historical empires they've reached a&nbsp;
point at the end where rather than funding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.000
things they need through taxation especially&nbsp;
of the richer people who can afford it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.800
they start to basically print money and borrow&nbsp;
from the rich and try to fund things that way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.720
and it can get into a bad spiral of you borrow&nbsp;
from the rich you give the money back to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.720
they get richer you can't afford the things you&nbsp;
need so you borrow from the rich again and i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:30.240
this could be really a dangerous space um and i'm&nbsp;
worried to be honest if we keep trying to run the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.200
economy this way where we pretend we can have&nbsp;
the things we need without ever taxing the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.680
who increasingly own everything then the rich&nbsp;
will get richer and richer and richer and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.320
rest of us will get we get poorer and poorer&nbsp;
and poorer and you will see this progressive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.960
falling in living conditions so you know i would&nbsp;
really encourage you to think about what it means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.160
when an economic policy results&nbsp;
in a massive massive cash windfall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.760
for the rich um what that means for you&nbsp;
what that means for our society because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.120
increasingly it seems like we're going to run&nbsp;
our economy this way um yeah think about that um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.800
but most of all you understand that £150 billion&nbsp;
it's not going to disappear it's going to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.800
the energy companies and then it's going to go&nbsp;
to wealthy individuals and they will use that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.640
to push up prices to buy the houses that your&nbsp;
kids need you know they'll give it to their kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.720
they'll buy houses ultimately it's going to cause&nbsp;
inequality to increase even more and that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.360
to have really damaging effects in the economy&nbsp;
okay so that's the first point which is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.600
this is going to lead to a massive increase in&nbsp;
equality um and a massive accumulation of cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.120
by the rich just like Covid did the second point&nbsp;
is and i think this is a really interesting one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.240
doesn't actually really solve the energy&nbsp;
crisis the reason for that is this okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.280
there is less energy in Europe now&nbsp;
than there was two-three years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.960
because Russia is reducing the amount of energy&nbsp;
it's exporting to Europe if there's less energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.760
that means somebody has to use less energy this is&nbsp;
like a physical fact there's less energy somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.280
has to use less so that raises the question of&nbsp;
who is going to reduce their energy consumption so

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.000
normally when there's less energy what will happen&nbsp;
in the capitalist free market economy is the price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.200
goes up and then what you'll see is poorer and&nbsp;
ordinary people will have to reduce their energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.600
consumption and that's not a good way to deal&nbsp;
with things because in many cases that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.040
not turning your heat on in the winter so in the&nbsp;
absence of any intervention what you would see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.880
is a massive decrease of energy usage by ordinary&nbsp;
families by poorer people which would be terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.840
you know cold homes people get sick people will&nbsp;
die that's what would happen so definitely you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.680
need some intervention but somebody has to reduce&nbsp;
their energy consumption right so what a sensible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.600
government would be doing would be looking at&nbsp;
the country and saying well where can we healthily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.320
reduce our energy consumption in what areas are&nbsp;
we using more energy than we need how do we reduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.680
these kinds of non-necessary energy consumption so&nbsp;
that ordinary families can keep the heating on now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.000
i want you to ask yourself a question under this&nbsp;
plan where the government is capping bills for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.120
everyone including the very rich who is going &nbsp;
to reduce their energy consumption, who? &nbsp;

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.040
if the prices are not going up beyond a certain point&nbsp;
who's going to reduce the energy consumption?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.160
well we know that prices are still increasing&nbsp;
significantly versus last year we know also that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.720
the average rich individual has accumulated&nbsp;
£100,000-200,000 cash over the last 2 years

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.160
their bills are being capped are the rich&nbsp;going
to reduce their energy consumption here?

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.560
why would they? they're richer than they've&nbsp;
ever been they're having their bills capped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.000
they are not going to reduce their energy&nbsp;
consumption right so if you have a situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.880
where we have less energy and we know the rich&nbsp;
are not going to reduce their energy consumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.600
then still it will have to be poorer and ordinary&nbsp;
families that have to reduce their energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.400
consumption so i honestly don't think this plan&nbsp;
is going to successfully save ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.240
from being in cold homes this winter because the&nbsp;
energy is not there the rich are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.480
reduce their consumption which means ordinary&nbsp;
families will still have to reduce their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.200
consumption i think what this shows us is that our&nbsp;
government is taking a phenomenally naive approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.920
to an energy crisis which is we have less&nbsp;
energy but the government rather than trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.000
to manage a reduction in usage of energy is&nbsp;
just giving out money, but money is not energy!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.840
if there's less energy you need to manage it&nbsp;
so that the people have the most excessive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.080
energy consumption reduce their energy usage&nbsp;
that is the only way to save ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.560
and we're doing nothing to do that nothing to do&nbsp;
that which means rich people will not reduce the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.480
energy consumption which means ultimately families&nbsp;
will still go cold you know if there's not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.000
energy you need to manage it so that the rich&nbsp;
reduce the energy consumption that is not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.600
to happen and i think what this highlights&nbsp;
more than anything is that our government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.160
and in many cases our economists are continuing to&nbsp;
be naive about the importance of distribution and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.960
never could it be more obvious than here look&nbsp;
there's a limited amount of energy available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.040
if we do not save that energy for the people&nbsp;
and families that need it then they will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.360
get enough and you need to have a policy which&nbsp;
actively focuses on reducing energy consumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.600
of the rich and supports the poor and it's not&nbsp;
there so my main concern is that unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.520
it's not going to work um the rich will not reduce&nbsp;
their energy consumption because they're having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.720
their bills paid by the government and by the&nbsp;
taxpayer which means there won't be enough energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.200
um the price of energy will go through the roof&nbsp;
because the rich are not reducing their usage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.920
there's not enough to go around which means the&nbsp;
government will be paying an enormous amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.680
money directly to the energy companies who are&nbsp;
themselves owned by the rich which means the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:23.200
will make an enormous profit um and ordinary&nbsp;
families will see their homes go cold so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.760
i know that's not a positive message but it's&nbsp;
important to realise it doesn't have to be this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:36.480
way right the total costing of this package is&nbsp;
£150,000,000,000 that's estimated this moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.400
if you look at The Times top 250 rich list&nbsp;
you'll see that in the first 12 months of&nbsp;Covid

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.520
those 250 individuals increased the wealth&nbsp;
by £106,000,000,000 so this could be paid for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.240
almost entirely just by taxing 1 year of excess&nbsp;
profits of just 250 individuals in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.840
um if you broaden it and look at the amount of&nbsp;
money that the rich as a whole have made in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.800
last three years that is £600,000,000,000 we&nbsp;
know that because the government's giving it out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.280
so somebody must have it and it is the rich who&nbsp;
have it if we were to take that money back we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.520
could give every single adult in the country&nbsp;
£13,000 each without borrowing anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.040
and this crisis would be over so i think&nbsp;
realistically there are alternatives but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.320
only if we start accepting that what we have&nbsp;
here is fundamentally a distributional crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.960
and that we need to be managing the wasteful&nbsp;
energy usage of the rich and the very rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.320
and that that is the only way to save poor and&nbsp;
ordinary families um so i'm sorry that's not a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:44.080
positive message but um people need to know what's&nbsp;
going to happen um and yeah good luck thank you
