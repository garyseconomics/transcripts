00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.160
basically, I want to just

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.840
do a video where we talk about the book
a little bit

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.000
we've introduced the fact that we doing it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.680
but we haven't actually really spoken much
about the book itself, the content.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.480
You know, I know this channel is

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040
“Gary’s
Economics”, it’s about the economics.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.000
But this book is going to be
a massive part of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.880
how this project goes forwards this year,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.800
it’s a massive opportunity
to get a ton of publicity.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.400
And it's another avenue to get
this message out to a ton of people.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.840
And I want the people
who've been watching this channel

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
for a long time, who have been
with this channel for a long time

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.520
to understand what we're doing,
And I just want to get like,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.000
I want the viewers, especially
if you've been around for a long time.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.760
I want to get them on board
on what they're doing.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480
Help them to understand
what's going to happen, because, you know,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.400
hopefully, touch wood we are going to get
like a ton of publicity coming up.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.320
February, March book comes out March 5th.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.920
And I just want everybody to feel like
we're doing this together, basically.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.640
I'm super,
super passionate about this book.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.880
I love this book.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.720
And I put a lot of myself
and my emotions into this book,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.680
and I want people to read it
because I think that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.440
it's a really powerful way
of getting our message out there.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.400
the book is mainly when I was a trader.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.200
So I started as a trader in 2008,
which is 15 years ago.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
The book ends in 2014,
which is nine years ago now.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.680
So really like, a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.160
lot of I wrote, I wrote it
by kind of inhabiting that space.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.880
You go back to where you were at the time
and how you felt at the time.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.560
You just kind of try to write it
how it was, how it felt at the time.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
And then

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.520
one thing that I kind of realised
writing it.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.600
There are people who watch the channel
will know like I went through quite

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.400
a lot of mad stuff when I was a trader
like I became Citi Bank’s top trader

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.720
by basically betting on the collapse
of the global economy when I was just 24,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.440
you know, I won that job in a card game
when I was 20 years old.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.280
You know, I worked with some crazy people,
and when I tried to quit,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.680
there were some pretty severe threats
thrown at me which were pretty stressful.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.880
And I went through like a lot
of sort of mental health difficulties

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.880
which you’ll read about in the book.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.840
But rewriting
the book, what I realised was

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.840
how alone I was in the
time, like doing the things I was doing.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.280
And I didn’t...

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.000
when I was at the time and the space
I didn’t really realise it,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.440
but the experience
of having this sort of crazy job,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.800
which paid me crazy amounts of money
by betting on these terrible things.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.680
It kind of started to isolate me
a little bit from the people around me,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.040
and I was dealing with all this mad stuff
that was happening like,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.800
my instinct as a young man
in my early twenties, mid

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.520
twenties was not to sort of
ask people around me for help.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.280
And in a weird way,
it was quite nice to write it now

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
because you kind of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.040
you get to feel
and I got to feel almost like I, me

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.960
now was being there for me
then by sort of writing it now.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.960
Like it sort of, you know,
I was a very young man

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.640
when these things happened,
and I kind of got to feel like now

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.800
in this like hypothetical way,
I can sort of be there with that person.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.920
And I not only that,
but also we can share this book

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.880
with,
you know, hopefully tens of thousands,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.280
hundreds of thousands, millions of people.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.240
You know,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.960
I would love for millions of people
to read this story and see what happened.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.680
And also,
I think, during the course of this story,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.320
it's a story of how I went from sort of
like a poor kid

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.680
to a millionaire.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.040
But it's also a story of how I realised
that the world is totally fucked.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.640
You know, this is a realisation
that I made when I was

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.560
24, that was really the year

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.160
that I started to realise, like,
okay, things are totally fucked.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.960
Things are going to be
totally terrible forever. And

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.000
it was
my job to do those analyses at the time.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880
And I went and I put the bet on
because that was my job.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.560
And I made millions of pounds
because that was my job.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.600
And everybody said,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.400
“Fantastic, you’re the best trader
in the world, well done.” And it was,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.360
it's crazy, right?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.800
It’s a crazy thing to happen.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.520
There's these stories in the book of
sort of my first bonus and how

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.520
it was much more than I expected
it was going to be.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.200
And I didn't know who can I tell.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.000
And I felt like I couldn’t
tell my parents.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.800
I felt like I couldn't tell my friends.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.320
I felt like I couldn’t tell my girlfriend.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.520
It’s such a crazy experience and I think

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.160
you know, loads of
people are going to hear it and be like,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.320
you made that much money
when you were, how old was I then?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.880
So I’d just turned 23.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.640
Young basically when that happened.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.440
But weirdly, like when I went back

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.040
and sort of re-lived it,
I experienced it as a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.080
traumatic event

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.440
in a way, like a shocking event.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.680
I think I never really sort of
stopped asking myself

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.720
until I started writing this book.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.720
How has that affected
you as a person, you know?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.800
When I go to parties and people say, “What
do you do?” The truth is,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.520
I am somebody
who has made millions of pounds

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520
by betting on the permanent collapse
of the global economy

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.600
and I've been judged
to be one of the best traders in the world

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.000
that knowing this thing,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.920
and I'm consistently right
predicting this thing,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.160
and I'm very confident
that that will happen.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.200
What do you tell someone,?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.880
You know, I make money

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.360
because I know that the global economy
is going to collapse, you know,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.040
But this book has given me
like a kind of a

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.760
space to rewrite my history

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.760
in such a way that rather than

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.080
being given and realising these terrible,
terrible bits of information

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.560
and having absolutely nothing you can do
about it, rather than make money,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.240
it's given me a space in a way
that I can tell this story

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.320
to other people in such a way
that hopefully

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.320
they can be convinced
that we need to stop this.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.320
So it's turned this

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.560
kind of horrible experience.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.240
And I say that like totally aware
that I've made a lot of money out of this,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.640
and it's given me a kind of financial
independence a lot people don't have.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.600
But this isolating experience,
this isolating knowledge of a bad thing

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.720
that's going to happen.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.400
Hopefully it's given me a way

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.680
to turn that into, you know,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
a warning for other people.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.440
So it was hard to write
and it was emotional and it was often sad.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.720
But that said, you know,
I wanted to make it funny.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.720
And I think there are funny moments in it.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.640
But hopefully it turned

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.160
a bad experience into something
which could be positive.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.280
And hopefully it's going to build us
that platform.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.960
It's going to hopefully sort of, you know,
kick the doors down and say, listen,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.200
we need to do something.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.680
We need to make things change.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.760
There's those bits in the book
where you're starting to ask the questions

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.040
about inequality and you're asking
people around you about it.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.520
And it's almost like you're
speaking to a brick wall sometimes.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.920
Are those are the moments
where you were like, I've got to get out.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.600
The subject of leaving,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600
leaving finance or in a bigger picture,
like, walking away from money

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.960
is a big

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.680
question in my life and the big question
of the book in a sense,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.240
like why did I leave?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.760
Why don't other people leave?
Should you leave?

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.480
You know, do you have
a moral responsibility to leave?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.080
Because the truth of the matter
is, it's not like,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.040
you leaving doesn't make no difference.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.600
You know,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.760
you gotta big city job
and you quit, it’s not going

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.480
to stop the collapse of the economy,
you know what I mean?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.920
And there’s this one conversation I have
in the book with the Arthur character,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.920
which is, you know, it's

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.880
coming towards the end of the book
Where I start to realise, it's

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.720
surprisingly late,
after I start betting on these things.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.320
Probably like a year and a half, two years
after I start betting on these things,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.960
that I start to ask the questions like,
should we do something about this?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.400
You know what I mean, is this a thing,
because I don't come

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.480
from a political family
and I was just doing my job.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.000
And then I start thinking,
should we do something,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.720
and I have this conversation
with this trader.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.480
And I'm like, should we do something?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.880
And he's like, well we did something,
we put the trade on.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.560
And I'm like,
you know, I’m not talking about the trade.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.280
It's not about the trade.
Should we do something?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.360
And he's like, well, what do you do? What

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.040
are you going to do?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.720
And, you know, I used to make millions
of pounds betting on these things.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.680
It's not like I was able to just walk out
and stop it from happening.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.720
I work hard at this.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.160
I'm trying to stop it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.080
But there’s a question of why did I leave?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.760
And it's not just me.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.760
There's a lot of characters in the book
who are sort of

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.720
bouncing around the ideas in their head,
should I leave?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.960
And I suppose there's sort of there's two
obvious

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.280
contrasting characters in the book,
which is me, and Caleb, my boss.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.240
And we both, you know,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.240
consider
quitting over the course of the book

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.000
and we end up taking
very different paths.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.800
And there's this

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.080
question of, what is your responsibility
as a human being?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.680
You know what I mean?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.240
How do you

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240
live your life in this world
that we live in

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.120
where things are getting worse
quite quickly?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.120
And first and foremost, I'm not the one
who's on the sharp end of it, right?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.160
But every single person out there
watching this video

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.720
has this question to ask themselves,
which is, shit's collapsing.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.320
I can't stop it.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.680
So what do I do?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.960
You know, and this is, of course,
most people are not,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.360
you know, big multimillion pound traders.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.240
But everybody has this question of
we live in this country and this society

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.520
and this world
where the economy is slowly falling apart.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.640
And we all have this

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.800
question inside ourselves.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.360
And, you know, some of us
hear it louder than others.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.640
Well, what should I do? What do you do?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.800
So I quit trading in 2014,
and ever since then I've been, you know,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.960
with varying degrees of intensity,
trying to figure out how we can stop this.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.200
It's not easy, you know what I mean?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.800
It's not like, some are like “Why don’t
you run for parliament?”

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.600
But it's not like
I just become a Labour MP and I stop this.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.680
It's more difficult than that, you know?

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.040
And I tried various
things, I've worked for think tanks.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.080
I made my website.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.120
I went back to university,
I did a master's degree before

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.200
I kind of settled on this.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.360
Okay, we're going to try and

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.560
build a YouTube, build social media.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.240
Use my personal sort of face,
use my myself as a brand

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.320
to try to bring people into this and

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.960
initially I was quite protective
of my personal story

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.720
just because, you know, like most people
I didn't want to like, splash my

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.880
personal story all over the newspapers

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.640
and I wanted to try and keep
a little bit of privacy.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.080
And we were able and we have been able
to build up like a decent community

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.440
and a decent like sort of movement
on the back of economics information.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.440
But I think I kind of knew from the start

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.680
like, this story's a good fucking story.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.520
I was expelled from school at 16,
I won my job in a card game

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.160
and I've become the top trader
in the world

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.920
by betting on the collapse
of the global economy.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.160
And then, like I have, you know,
I get basically threatened

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.840
when I try to leave and have this sort of
very difficult journey out.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.280
I kind of knew that

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.520
if we can find the right

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.280
vehicle for this story,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.360
that it could potentially

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.640
be a passport to a much bigger audience.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.120
And this is what we're going to need.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.160
Look, it's been great

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.880
growing this YouTube, and I'm
very thankful for the support of everyone

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.320
who's been watching, everyone who's been
sharing the videos from the start.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.600
But we need to be bigger.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.680
We just need to be bigger.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.520
So I started writing this book,
you know, a year and a half ago,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.760
and I just thought this could be it,
you know, this could be our way.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.840
And in the course of us all

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.400
fell in love with writing it
and I think this is such a...

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.160
I think people watching,
they might think that the book is going

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.400
to be kind of like the YouTube channel,
you know, like vignettes,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.400
short stories, my time in trading
and how it relates to the economy.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.840
The book is...

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.240
I wanted the book to be like a novel,
to be like a film.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.160
I want you to be

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.720
there.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.280
I want you to be

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.200
19 year old Gary Stevenson, at LSE.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.120
21 year old Gary Stevenson
walking onto the trading floor

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.120
for the first time, 23, 24 year old Gary
Stevenson realising what's happening,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.200
becoming the best trader in the world.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.040
I want you to experience that.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.120
And I think that hopefully
is going to appeal to people

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.680
in the way
that we can never do on YouTube.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.680
We can't give you that experience,
you know?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.160
So I think it's a way to grow our message.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.240
I think it's a really powerful way
to tell this story

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.440
I think the YouTube can help the book
and the film,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.160
and the book and the film

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.720
can help the YouTube and together,
I think these two things together can help

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.560
us build

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.280
this into a political movement.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.680
I didn't start this
YouTube to have a YouTube, You know.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.280
I started this YouTube
to change fucking policy

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.400
and I think this is the way that we do
So I should mention

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.720
because obviously we're doing the book,
the publishers will kill me if I don't.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.920
The book is called The Trading Game.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.760
The Trading Game:
A Confession by me, Gary Stevenson.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.840
Comes out on March 5th.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.400
I would love for you to support it.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.200
I would love you to preorder
it. I'd love you to buy it.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.800
The more preorders
we get, the more chance we have to come in

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.000
at number one and blow it up.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.080
We have a discount code from Waterstones,
which is TTG2024.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.840
The trading game, 2024.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.720
TTG2024, which should get you 20% off.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.560
We are going to

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.680
have book signing events
across the country.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.760
At the moment I think
we're going to have them in London,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.280
Bristol, Bath,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.560
Liverpool, Manchester,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.920
Edinburgh
and Dublin is what I think we have so far.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.640
As soon as I have dates
I'll put them down.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.360
But you know, I know
we haven't done any public events yet,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.680
so if people want to come meet me,
get a book signed,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.280
we’ll put those events up.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.520
But I know it's a bit of a change
from what we’re doing. But

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.920
I'm really excited about the book.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.720
I think it's really good.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.680
You know,
I'd love the support of the viewers

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.080
and if you want to buy the book,
this is it.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.880
The Trading Game, Gary Stevenson.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.960
I honestly think it's just

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.760
an exciting read.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.200
The cameraman’s read it.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.280
He seems to like it
so I hope you will too.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:22.840
But thank you.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.840
And, you know, we'll keep the videos
coming.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.000
More about economics,
more about the book, thank you.
