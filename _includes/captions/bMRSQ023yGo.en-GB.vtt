00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.160
Today, we are going to talk about

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.720
the changing shape of Great Britain.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.720
I've come down to Waterlooville

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.840
because I’m helping my Mum and Dad out with an eye test,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840
but bloody hell.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.960
Like, this is definitely not what it was.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.480
I grew up around here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.640
I used to sit on that cannon as a kid,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.880
and I think a lot these shops, like,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.520
I remember I used to come and get my Pepe

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.560
jeans from one of these shops. But look at it.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.000
There's bloody nothing here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.760
It's crazy.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600
I want to talk about this.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.520
This phenomenon of the death of the smaller town.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.320
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.720
so a couple of years ago

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.600
in the winter, I went to Colombia for two months

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.320
because I wanted to practice my Spanish

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.360
and because I hate winter.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.520
So Colombia is a massive country, its about,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.920
I think it's like five or six times bigger than the UK.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.320
It might even be more.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.240
And the population is a lot less than the UK,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.600
just over half the UK. So

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.480
it's a big, low population density country.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.520
It's a much poorer country than the UK.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.800
So I was expecting it to be quite rural, right?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.440
There's a lot of space, there's a lot of farmland.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.480
There's not that many people.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.720
I thought it would be like spread out,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.560
you know, it’s a poorer country,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.760
so there might be people, like, working in agriculture.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.280
But I got there,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.440
I flew into Bogotá

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.000
and straightaway Bogotá is like a massive city.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600
Bogotá is like, you know, it's almost as big as London,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240
it might even be as big as London.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240
And I was quite surprised, right,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.920
because you have much fewer people in the country,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560
but they've got a massive city the size of London.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.720
And then after that, I took a bus to Medellín,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.280
which is the second biggest city.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.520
And then again you have another city which is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.640
almost as big as London.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.040
So I was kind of like a little bit blown away by this,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
like how can this country, massive country

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.560
with a relatively small population, have two cities

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.800
the size of London?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.120
And it got me thinking about this quite a lot.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.960
And the more I travelled in Latin America

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.440
and in other countries as well,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.600
I started to realise that actually

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.400
this is quite commonly the shape

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.800
of like a relatively well developed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.960
but very unequal country, which is that

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.200
you have a huge amount of farmland,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.680
but it's largely industrialised

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160
and not many people live in that farmland.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.120
And all of the people then basically,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.640
they have no jobs and they need jobs.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.040
So they have to swarm basically

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.840
to where the rich people are

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360
because the rich have all the money

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.520
and you end up with these sort of,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.560
huge super cities

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.200
with a very, very wealthy centre and kind of large area

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840
of essentially very low quality housing.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.200
You could call it a slum around these these big cities.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.920
And this is not unique to Colombia.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.280
This is the situation

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.360
in most poorer,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.760
most monarchical countries in the world. And

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.560
it basically got me

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040
thinking about what the shape of a country is.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.320
I think in capitalism, your country has to...

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.640
the physical shape of your country

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.920
has to reflect the wealth distribution of your country.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920
And if you look at Western European countries,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.840
they have a different shape,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.760
which is they have some big cities,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.680
some smaller cities, and they have some towns,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.320
they have some people living in rural settings.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.400
It's much more diverse

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.880
than these extreme unequal countries

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.240
where increasingly the people live

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.480
in these slums around super cities.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.000
And if you think about it, this makes sense, right?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.480
Because if you have a relatively equal economy,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.000
then every person in that economy is a small scale

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.960
wealth holder.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.040
They are a worker and they're also a consumer.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.680
And what that means is basically any

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.040
size settlement, is sustainable?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.880
Because as long as you have a group of people there

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.840
you have

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.160
wealth holders, you have consumers,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.960
and you have workers,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.440
and everybody can work for each other

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.120
and everybody can consume each other's work.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.880
So, you know, small cities are sustainable,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.720
towns are sustainable, villages are sustainable

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.760
because everybody can work for each other.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.600
But once you have a very unequal society,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.840
then what you have is basically two kinds of people.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.200
You have a very large group

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.080
of very poor people who need to work,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.640
and you have a very small group of extremely wealthy

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.240
people who have an enormous amount of money to spend.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.040
And what that means then is if you have

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.120
a group, a village,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.680
which doesn't include any rich people,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.360
you have a ton of workers and you have no employer,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.800
you have no consumer.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.040
So these small cities basically become,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.400
they basically become non-viable, non sustainable.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.080
And these cities have to essentially disband

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.240
and the people need to move towards

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.760
not even necessarily the big cities,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.800
but wherever rich people exist.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.720
And I think what we have in this country,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.480
the UK and you also see in the US in places

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.280
like the Rust Belt and actually a lot of Europe,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.120
I think what you have

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.160
is transitional countries

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.520
in the sense that we used to be a country

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.440
with a relatively large property owning middle class.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.160
So these people lived in a variety

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.040
of different cities, big cities, small cities,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.440
towns, and these places were sustaining.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.600
But now we have moved

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.280
and we are continually moving into this more

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.520
Colombia type model.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.200
You know, it's common across Latin America,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.920
including the poor countries in Asia,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.560
maybe some Eastern European countries.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.480
We're moving to that very unequal model where

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.160
people need to live, where the rich people live.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.680
So they need to move,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.080
they need to move to these super cities.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.840
And

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.320
you’re seeing that,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.760
you're seeing the world basically split

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.520
into two kinds of places or places

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.800
where there are no rich people and places

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.680
where there are rich people.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.800
And I think this is often described

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.840
by economists in a way

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.080
which I think is incorrect as an increasing...

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.360
such a classic economist way to describe a problem,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.360
increasing preference towards large cities.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.320
They say, well,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.720
people just like large cities now, so

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.680
everybody's moving to large cities.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.920
But I think this doesn't really

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.760
fit the model right,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.600
because if you look at a place like

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.120
Newcastle, Newcastle is a large city,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.560
Glasgow is a large city.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.360
These are cities where there's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.960
increasing economic deprivation and people are leaving.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.760
Whereas if you look at a place like

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.360
Cambridge or Oxford,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.520
these are small cities

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
and yet these are places

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.880
where people are moving to the cities

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.240
and where housing is extraordinarily expensive.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.080
If you look at, for example,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.520
the Swiss Alps or the Hamptons,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.200
a popular holiday destination

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.360
in the states for wealthy people,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.520
these are not big cities

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.000
and they're becoming very expensive.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.120
So actually what you are seeing is people flooding

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.560
from the country to wherever rich people are.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.200
And that is what you have to do

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.280
when countries become more unequal.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.840
I think we are moving

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.720
from the physical shape of an equal country

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.200
to the physical shape of an unequal country.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.800
And you also see that in big cities.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.280
So I'm from London, I come from Ilford in East London.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.680
And

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.200
this is a place

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.200
where people are swarming to this place.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.160
And one of the most common

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.320
solutions that is put forward to the housing crisis is

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.600
you have to build more houses,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
you have to build more houses.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.680
And

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.440
I'm from Ilford and people from other,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.120
sort of, more distant suburbs, poorer

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.600
suburbs of London

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.360
will be very aware that in these places

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.200
enormous amounts of housing is being built.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.240
And if you go to the street I grew up on,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.960
the density has increased enormously.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.120
All of the houses have been expanded upwards,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.440
all the houses have been expanded backwards.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.600
There was a factory at the end of the street

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.240
which has been knocked down

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.960
and replaced with a massive block of flats.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.320
And these

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.920
are providing extremely low quality housing

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.040
because these cities are increasingly full of extremely

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.240
poor people.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.320
And I think

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.440
I'm not opposed to building more houses, but I think

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.760
unequal economies,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.440
the shape of these countries

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.880
is basically enormous slums around the wealthy centers.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.120
And that,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.160
because our economy

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.080
is becoming a very unequal economy,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.800
that is what our country wants

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.400
to become like from a capitalist perspective.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.680
So if we build more houses

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.880
under this situation of high and growing inequality,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.560
we will build that physical slum space.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.840
If you go back to Ilford,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.200
especially the part of Ilford I'm from,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200
that is what it's becoming.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.400
So I think when I see this video,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.000
what I see is a transitional country.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.200
You know, we used to be a middle class country

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.320
and we are becoming a very highly unequal country.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.720
And highly unequal countries

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.120
don't have cute little towns for ordinary people.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.520
They have slums for ordinary people.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.200
And if you go to,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.800
you know, if you go to highly unequal countries,

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.480
like most of the countries in Latin America, you know,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.480
you go to Mexico City, you'll see the same thing.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.000
People are forced out of the countryside.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.600
The countryside gets,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.760
you know, industrialised from a farming perspective.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.640
Some of it gets kept as playgrounds for the rich

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.840
and people swarm to the big cities and

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.760
I'm very skeptical that building

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.960
will solve the problem.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.680
I lived in Tokyo for two years,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.360
and that is a city with 38 million people

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.120
and very unaffordable housing.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.080
I think poverty is the problem.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.720
You know, if you don't get money

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.120
in ordinary people's pockets,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.880
then everybody has to live close to the rich people

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.960
and there are fewer and fewer rich people

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.960
and those people are richer and richer. So

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.680
I think unless you fix the wealth distribution,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.800
then this video of emptying out

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.200
small towns is the future of this country,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.040
But not just this country,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.840
but also America and also most of Europe.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.200
And I don't want it to go that way.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.960
And one solution is we build more housing in London

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.680
and we turn London into the super slum it's becoming.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.560
And another solution is

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.800
we get money in people's pockets and allow people

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.720
to live where their families have lived in 100...

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.640
for hundreds of years

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.320
because they can afford to work for each other.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.360
And that's the future

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.600
which I'd rather have for this country, for America

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.920
and for the rest of Europe. We can do it.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.360
But we can only do it if we deal with inequality.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.880
And the only way to deal with inequality

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.680
is to tax the rich.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.480
So we're going to campaign for it, we’re here

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.400
every week. Thank you for your support.
