00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
if I worked too hard, but it was it was
difficult<00:01:38.320><c> for</c><00:01:38.560><c> me</c><00:01:38.880><c> because</c><00:01:39.360><c> we</c><00:01:39.680><c> we'd</c>

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
difficult for me because we we'd
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
difficult for me because we we'd

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
for me to like keep pushing and push
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.310 align:start position:0%

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
needed to really run in. It felt like
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.030 align:start position:0%
needed to really run in. It felt like

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
have the energy that I needed to push us
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 align:start position:0%
have the energy that I needed to push us

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
to where where we needed to be. And that
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.150 align:start position:0%
to where where we needed to be. And that
was<00:02:16.720><c> difficult</c><00:02:16.959><c> for</c><00:02:17.120><c> me</c><00:02:17.440><c> to</c><00:02:17.680><c> be</c><00:02:17.760><c> honest,</c>

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
was difficult for me to be honest,
 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
was difficult for me to be honest,
especially<00:02:18.480><c> because</c><00:02:18.640><c> it</c><00:02:18.879><c> felt</c><00:02:19.040><c> like</c><00:02:19.200><c> we</c><00:02:19.360><c> were</c>

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
especially because it felt like we were
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.110 align:start position:0%
especially because it felt like we were
quite<00:02:20.160><c> close</c><00:02:20.400><c> to</c><00:02:20.560><c> winning</c><00:02:20.959><c> at</c><00:02:21.280><c> times.</c><00:02:22.239><c> But</c><00:02:22.879><c> I</c>

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
quite close to winning at times. But I
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
quite close to winning at times. But I
think<00:02:23.280><c> if</c><00:02:23.440><c> I'm</c><00:02:23.599><c> honest,</c><00:02:24.560><c> we</c><00:02:24.720><c> we</c><00:02:25.040><c> were</c><00:02:25.200><c> probably</c>

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
think if I'm honest, we we were probably
 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
think if I'm honest, we we were probably
never<00:02:25.760><c> that</c><00:02:26.000><c> close</c><00:02:26.319><c> yet.</c><00:02:27.040><c> And</c><00:02:27.200><c> it's</c><00:02:27.440><c> probably</c>

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
never that close yet. And it's probably
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.350 align:start position:0%
never that close yet. And it's probably
