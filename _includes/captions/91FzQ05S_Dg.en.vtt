00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.680
Welcome back to the world transformed we are&nbsp;
socialist Think Tank and we are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.620
talking today about the cost of living crisis this&nbsp;
is the big one this is something that I think on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.660
the left we really need to address because the&nbsp;
mainstream media narrative about what's causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.840
the cost of living crisis and the solutions to&nbsp;
the cost of living crisis simply aren't being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.600
explained very well at all they're confusing&nbsp;
people to be honest they make literally no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.880
sense because in my view they're trying to cover&nbsp;
something up they're trying to tell us a story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.920
that's different from what reality is so today&nbsp;
we're going to explore the reality of the cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.320
of living crisis I'll introduce myself I'm Paul&nbsp;
Daley I'm a presenter at socialist Think Tank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
and now I'm going to pass you to my amazing guests&nbsp;
I'm going to start off with Sarah from the biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.060
Union Sarah would you like to say something&nbsp;
about yourself tell us who you are yes I'm um

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.100
around it time and understand

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.160
so like for me that the important thing is&nbsp;
you've you've done the job where you're with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.420
your workplace representative were you like a&nbsp;
shop steward in the union there I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.160
so important for a general secretary to have&nbsp;
that background in really dealing with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.660
day-to-day stuff so you will really understand&nbsp;
how people are living their lives and also I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.920
suppose having worked in a shop you get to&nbsp;
see like all the different aspects of society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.100
and people coming through the doors and that&nbsp;
kind of thing is that a fair assumption yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.220
um and also we've got Gary Gary can you tell us&nbsp;
a little bit about yourself because we're very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.360
excited to have you on also uh yeah my name's Gary&nbsp;
Stevenson uh I'm an economist mainly inequality uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.060
the big thing for me is my back because I was I&nbsp;
was a Trader I worked as a Trader after the 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.060
crisis I worked for Citibank and I became City&nbsp;
bank's most profitable Trader in the world by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
betting that because you wouldn't fix inequality&nbsp;
that crisis would last for a very long time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.680
have very bad impact on our economy so um I did&nbsp;
that for a few years I bet that the economy would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.740
never recover and I made a lot of money doing&nbsp;
it and after a couple years you start to think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.080
maybe I should try and stop this from happening&nbsp;
so uh I quit that job which the bank wasn't too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.440
happy about I went and did a degree in economics&nbsp;
at Oxford and uh that was though to push guys in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.180
capes in working in castles and I think this is&nbsp;
probably not where change is going to come from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.960
so I quit that and I started to sort of try and&nbsp;
speak publicly so now I've got a YouTube called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.300
Gary's economics where I try and basically&nbsp;
explain to people how serious inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.820
Is wealth inequality the effect it has on the&nbsp;
economy the effect it has on ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.780
the big aim of the YouTube is basically to make a&nbsp;
space where we talk about economics in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.780
is accessible and easy for just ordinary people&nbsp;
to understand um and it's super important now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
because coven has seen the biggest and fastest&nbsp;
ever increase in inequality in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.440
um obviously the budget yesterday will see&nbsp;
another massive increase inequality and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.460
yeah it's really important that people understand&nbsp;
how that's going to affect themselves people get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.080
chance to talk about it yeah definitely and from&nbsp;
your point of view do you think like the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.900
is deliberately cloudy you know so they'll they'll&nbsp;
use words that ordinary people might zone out on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.460
and you know they might not really engage with&nbsp;
economics and think Ah that's actually above me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.000
do you think that's a deliberate thing or do you&nbsp;
think that's something that's happened by accident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.080
you mentioned like the kind of people at Oxford&nbsp;
and capes yeah I think I think there's a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.120
in my opinion with the culture of economics in&nbsp;
general which is that it's become the norm to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.040
use these this complicated phrases complicated&nbsp;
words like acronyms people don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.520
um I think a big problem we have with economics is&nbsp;
that there's basically two odds of Economics which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.080
is this sort of public phase and economics like&nbsp;
media journalism Central Banking or the bank of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.280
England and then there's the financial markets if&nbsp;
you go in the financial markets everybody's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.200
you have to be right all the time and you get&nbsp;
rewarded very aggressively if you're right but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.660
then in this public world the incentives are such&nbsp;
the sort of speak a good game and sort of sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.960
smart and look smart so if you ask me you know&nbsp;
you get these people on the news talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.220
economics the reality is they are not trying to&nbsp;
be right they're not rewarded for being right you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.720
know at the beginning of the financial crisis&nbsp;
I put out articles in open democracy videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.860
of my YouTube saying after after code we're&nbsp;
going to see a massive cost of living crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.140
and that was right at the same time you know Larry&nbsp;
Elliot had economics editor of the Guardian so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.500
we're going to see a house price collapse you know&nbsp;
three years later where's the punishment for that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.120
so ultimately these guys in the media they're not&nbsp;
trying to be right they're not rewarded for being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.920
right and I think that's a big problem that's why&nbsp;
you get basically I had analysis unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.920
that's uh yeah that's really Rings true I think I&nbsp;
think a lot of people at all will be singing you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.320
know that that's exactly their experience of it&nbsp;
you know we're told all these things like as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.060
as if there's some like tremendous all cni that&nbsp;
will understand the the economics of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.240
at the same time they're getting it wrong every&nbsp;
single time guaranteed to get it wrong every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.900
single time so I'm going to firstly let's come&nbsp;
to Sarah because we'll be just there sorting out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.780
a couple of issues there with their Gary's mate&nbsp;
um Sarah the cost of living crisis what are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.640
seeing for your members so let's talk about like&nbsp;
what is the reality on the ground because I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.940
a fear that we haven't seen the worst of it but&nbsp;
we are starting to see some real negative effects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.100
on people and how they live their lives so what&nbsp;
are you seeing what are you getting reported to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.680
you through your membership so if I take you&nbsp;
back to last year so before we'd even kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.840
fully got into this cost of living crisis we&nbsp;
surveyed our members around their access to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.120
food through the pandemic so our members in the&nbsp;
main worked throughout the whole of the pandemic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.840
you know producing Foods selling food when we&nbsp;
got the results back from the survey 40 of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.040
um were eating enough because they didn't have&nbsp;
enough food to eat one in five actually ran out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.040
of food between paydays 35 were eating less so&nbsp;
the kids could have enough to eat um we've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.320
seven and a half percent that had become fully&nbsp;
reliant on food banks and one in five were using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.160
friends and family to support them to provide&nbsp;
them food so they could feed themselves and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.840
the families that was before you know the cost of&nbsp;
petrol rocket aired the the energy prices went up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.400
if we run that now you know I know that those&nbsp;
figures would be double what they were back then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.700
and we'd have more respondents and it it's just&nbsp;
catastrophic we've got members that are telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.600
us that they're doing extra shifts at McDonald's&nbsp;
just so they can have a free meal whilst they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.880
there because otherwise there wouldn't be eating&nbsp;
at all we've got members that you know have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.400
anonymously told us that they're actually pinching&nbsp;
food from work so that they can can go on and try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:23.460
and create something that's now that's we're&nbsp;
still in kind of the my dad never used to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.480
us put the eating on until the end of October&nbsp;
it was quite tight being a Yorkshire man but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.500
people haven't had to put their eating on&nbsp;
after because they've been in such warm weather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.720
Our concern is when we get to a point where people&nbsp;
are thinking right I need to rank up the heating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.940
now the bills are going to fire up what's going to&nbsp;
happen we know there are millions of children in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.400
poverty that have got working parents and the&nbsp;
reality for many of our members is they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.500
know they're going to afford to get to work to do&nbsp;
work to then pay the bills that they need to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.420
um and it's heartbreaking because these are&nbsp;
people like I say that we're working through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.640
pandemic celebrated as key workers but aren't&nbsp;
paid enough to be able to feed themselves in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:10.620
the families yeah we had a we had a big thing&nbsp;
like um our local MP um in Sedgefield was uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.020
you know he was he was saying about how much he&nbsp;
supported key workers and he was out clapping on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.580
his doorstep and making a big deal of it but at&nbsp;
the same time he was bought through legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.280
that meant that people who were earned under a&nbsp;
certain amount of money were considered to be law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.520
skilled workers well which is a is a key workers&nbsp;
or is it law skilled you know like these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.680
a lot of the time it doesn't mean low skilled&nbsp;
at all they defined it by low pay I think all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.120
jobs out there have an element of skill about them&nbsp;
you know you can think about any job that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.020
I've done all sorts of different jobs I've been a&nbsp;
cleaner at one point in my life I'll tell you what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.360
I didn't have the skills necessary for that it was&nbsp;
really really hard I was not very good at it but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.280
um I tried my best and I would love to see some&nbsp;
of these MPS like make 65 Sandwiches an hour at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.840
Greg's I'll put cherries on the top of a Bakewell&nbsp;
tart they just wouldn't be able to do it that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:07.740
deemed as a law skilled job but it isn't otherwise&nbsp;
everybody would be able to do it absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.020
absolutely agree um and along with this so all&nbsp;
those things that you've heard there Gary you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:22.080
we've been told that this is because of what's&nbsp;
going on in Ukraine and this is because Global gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.420
prices have gone up and things like that I think&nbsp;
people are ready now because people understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.420
that that's a lie people understand that this was&nbsp;
happening before any conflict in Ukraine this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.980
happening anyway and I think people are ready for&nbsp;
the truth on this one now you said you predicted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:45.480
this was going to happen so yeah firstly how did&nbsp;
you predict it and what do you think the cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.480
is of this like does that fit in with what you&nbsp;
predicted like I want to get the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.340
thing like out straight out of the door because&nbsp;
this crisis is often spoken about in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.280
like it's caused entirely by the war in Ukraine&nbsp;
um basically if it's called entirely by external&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.560
events almost like a natural disaster um if it&nbsp;
was a natural disaster everybody would be taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.020
some sort of pain the last two years have seen the&nbsp;
biggest and fastest ever increase in millionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:19.080
and billionaire wealth in their history of this&nbsp;
country that's just a cold fact if you look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.960
just the top 250 richest individuals in the&nbsp;
country they made 106 billion pounds increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.300
in their wealth in the first one year of Kobe so&nbsp;
the entire cost of the energy package is less than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.880
100 billion pounds so we could pay for that if we&nbsp;
just tax the top 250 people enough to make them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.800
as rich as they were before covert happened if&nbsp;
you broaden that if you were to tax the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.440
wealthy class enough to make them as rich as they&nbsp;
were before covert started you could give every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.020
single adult in the entire country 13 000 pounds&nbsp;
and this crisis would be over at the drop of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:59.520
head this is what drives me insane about what's&nbsp;
Happening Here politicians sit on the sofas of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.500
BBC breakfast and they talk about it like it's&nbsp;
oh it's so terrible what's happened right if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.940
you were to tax the rich enough to make them as&nbsp;
rich as they were three years ago you could give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:16.080
every adult in the country 13 000 pounds so the&nbsp;
people watching what could you do with 13 000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.500
this is not even every household every adult&nbsp;
this what drives me so crazy about this crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:31.080
in unnecessary is does not need to happen this&nbsp;
is not it's not a natural disaster this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:37.080
crisis of inequality listen if you if you have a&nbsp;
disaster like covid and in that disaster you allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.000
the biggest and fastest ever increasing inequality&nbsp;
to happen in your country you cannot be surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.620
when it's immediately followed by the biggest&nbsp;
and fastest ever decrease in living standards for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.120
ordinary families because that is what inequality&nbsp;
means you have made the rich richer and you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.400
made ordinary families significantly poor imagine&nbsp;
if the government came out and taxed every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.860
adult in the country 12 000 pounds and gave it&nbsp;
to the rich people would be up in arms but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.120
is what has happened and the reason I was able to&nbsp;
predict this is because at the very beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.220
covid you could see this happening you knew&nbsp;
straight away that things like furlough and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.720
I'm not against furlough in any way you could see&nbsp;
straight away it was unbelievably expensive so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.400
have to ask two questions where's the money coming&nbsp;
from and where's it ending up nobody asked that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.720
nobody asked that okay if the money's not coming&nbsp;
from the rich then it's coming from the taxpayer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.980
okay so come and where's the money ending up okay&nbsp;
if you did not end up twelve thousand pound richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.780
somebody has your money and you could see from&nbsp;
the beginning of covert because during covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.420
ordinary families expenses did not decrease&nbsp;
significantly most ordinary families 70 80 90 of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.760
their expensive expenses rent mortgage food bills&nbsp;
and those expenses did not disappear but if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.680
look at very rich families most of their spending&nbsp;
is luxury expensive holidays expensive restaurants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.200
expensive bars going to the theater right all of&nbsp;
that stuff stops so during covid the spending of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.820
very rich families collapse at 70 80 but a lot&nbsp;
of that spending pays the bills of all the no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.260
families who work in those sectors so what you see&nbsp;
during covert is the rich stop spending and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.640
the new families stop receiving their incomes okay&nbsp;
so the government steps in and prints the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.500
gives it to ordinary families ordinary families&nbsp;
use it to pay their bills the owners of the assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.240
are the rich and they're not spending so in the&nbsp;
end 600 billion pounds from the government to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.460
rich that was predictable from the start of covet&nbsp;
so if you're that's 12 000 pounds per adult if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.920
that all goes to top 10 you're talking about every&nbsp;
single adult and the top 10 making a hundred two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.180
hundred grand pure cash so I'm asking you imagine&nbsp;
the government gave 100 200 Grand to every rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.460
person in the country of course you're going to&nbsp;
see inflationary crisis how much money is 100 200&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:47.100
grand for every single rich person in the country&nbsp;
this was so predictable in advance so painfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:53.220
predictable if the government is going to give out&nbsp;
600 billion pounds somebody has to do the analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.500
of where does that money end up who benefits who&nbsp;
gets richer and nobody did it nobody the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.480
did it nobody in the labor party did it nobody the&nbsp;
bank of England did it nobody did it it's criminal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.340
and then after that that enormous increase&nbsp;
amount of the rich you could you could tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.020
it back and you could solve this crisis what do&nbsp;
they do they slash taxes on rich people it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.680
I cannot I cannot believe what's happening and&nbsp;
and you know as somebody who has personally made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.820
millions of pounds betting that if you smash an&nbsp;
equality through the roof you destroy the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.320
and destroy a living standards for ordinary&nbsp;
people I know I'm not the person who's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.860
get hurt by this but I can I know what's going&nbsp;
to happen down the line and it's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.440
you know I run a YouTube channel talking about&nbsp;
this stuff and when I saw happened yesterday I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.440
was thinking is it even right for me to make a&nbsp;
video about this because maybe it's better that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.700
people don't know because I cannot describe to you&nbsp;
how bad this is gonna you know I hear you talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.080
about this and and I wish I could tell you that&nbsp;
that was temporary and it's going to get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.020
but if you look at the policies this is going to&nbsp;
get significantly worse and it's this is me I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.580
not you know I'm I'm a wealthy person I'm not the&nbsp;
one who's going to get hurt by this and it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.860
difficult for me to think about what's happening&nbsp;
so it's it's yeah it was predictable because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.040
could see from the beginning of Kobe we were&nbsp;
going to see a massive increase in inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.220
and I think people need to understand given a ton&nbsp;
of money to rich people hurts you as an ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.360
family because it makes them it makes you poor&nbsp;
relative to them they get more resources you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.020
get less resources that's what we're seeing&nbsp;
and it's so important people understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.680
because if people don't understand that then the&nbsp;
government can do what they do and what we saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.680
yesterday and it's heartbreaking and it hurts&nbsp;
me to hear these stories yes I that's a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:41.580
bleak picture to be honest that you've you've just&nbsp;
painted there um it's for me the economy is broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.980
if that money is going straight to rich people&nbsp;
so they pump the money in at the bottom if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.900
economy is pumping that wealth straight to the&nbsp;
Top This trickle up system's not even trickled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.460
up it's Rush your business it's like it's getting&nbsp;
pumped up absolutely exorbitant rate all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.820
that's a broken economy and broken economies&nbsp;
need to be fixed with taxes you know you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:08.220
be taxing money out from the wealthy people from&nbsp;
the wealthiest to give it to everyone else because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.140
the economy is broken personally I'd rather&nbsp;
see that wealth circulated within a community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.480
but the economy's still broken because we've got&nbsp;
so many massive corporations small businesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.040
going by the wayside like in my area there are&nbsp;
so many small businesses folding at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.320
and people say like you know the conservatives&nbsp;
are the party of business but they're not the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.300
part of your small business there's a party&nbsp;
of massive massive companies and massive CEOs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.640
you'll know a thing or two about CEOs won't&nbsp;
you Sarah how are the CEOs doing because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:47.040
know like I'm going to come under that weird weird&nbsp;
economic car crash that was the budget yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.000
um I'm going to come onto that shortly but like&nbsp;
you know shall we just check are the CEOs okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.940
in the industry do you think they're going to be&nbsp;
okay after all this yeah because they must have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.500
been from that budget yesterday they must be&nbsp;
the ones in bother but like are they all right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.780
I'd imagine so yeah I would imagine so although&nbsp;
you know if we could get some of our members and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:16.020
and communities standing up and demanding better&nbsp;
you know um maybe they won't be you know I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.760
we should have a bit of a France element where&nbsp;
people are out on the streets you know and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.920
the conscious stops and I know we're probably&nbsp;
a long way from that but I'm kind of wondering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.780
what it's going to take for people to do that you&nbsp;
know people talk about a general stripe I think we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.860
need more than that though we need people out on&nbsp;
the streets saying we're not happy and we're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.480
having any more we want a new government because&nbsp;
nobody wants this trust now you're the person to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.180
talk to you about this because I know the Bakers&nbsp;
Union have um kind of pushed back quite a bit on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:50.280
this and we've seen a few victories and you&nbsp;
have organized now one of the things that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.960
very very difficult I think to organize amongst&nbsp;
Working Class People and amongst people who don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.320
have a lot of wealth is if they're going to take&nbsp;
action they've got to sacrifice a day's pay and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.560
day's pay could be the difference between them&nbsp;
eaten or not eaten and that is a huge thing if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.460
you're going to withdraw your labor like remember&nbsp;
when the conservative party all went on strike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.180
over Boris Johnson eventually when they realized&nbsp;
the writing was on the wall and they couldn't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.420
associated with these awful Behavior anymore&nbsp;
and they tried to Rebrand themselves again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.220
they were able to go on strike they were able to&nbsp;
withdraw their labor from him because there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.120
no consequence they were still getting their MP&nbsp;
salary and things like that it's so easy to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.080
if you don't have anything to risk and we've got&nbsp;
like I can't you I can't like go uh through this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.360
without mentioning we've got Heather Woods sitting&nbsp;
over there Legend uh legend of the minor strikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.220
who kept people going during the minor strikes&nbsp;
in the 1980s uh which is absolutely brilliant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:50.640
to see so you know how do you get people to take&nbsp;
those risks how do you support them in doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.860
that must be a massive challenge for you in the&nbsp;
Bakers Union it is I mean we're quite a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:02.880
Union in comparison to some of the the larger&nbsp;
unions out there um but I think nobody chooses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:09.000
to take strike action lightly you're right it's&nbsp;
a it's a lost day's worth of pay but I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.160
you can see with the the rising number of people&nbsp;
that are choosing to take strike action just how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.580
pissed off people are I wasn't sure whether&nbsp;
I could swear then oh you can swear start for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:27.240
a second and you can just see how pissed off&nbsp;
people are and how how they're just angry that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.920
they're the people that have kept us going yet&nbsp;
the bosses that have stopped at home been safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.240
through a global pandemic or getting richer and&nbsp;
and they're still struggling to make ends meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.160
um and I suppose it comes to a Tipping&nbsp;
Point doesn't it you carry on as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.080
struggling or you lose a day's pay and maybe&nbsp;
get something better at the end of it or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.280
you lose multiple days pay and get something&nbsp;
better and I think as trade unions we all try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.060
and support our members you know we make sure&nbsp;
there's food on the picket lines we're not all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.680
in positions where we can support our members&nbsp;
financially but we do everything that we can to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.880
make sure that that picket line they're not you&nbsp;
know they're not being stabbed back into work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.980
um and I think we're going to see more of that in&nbsp;
the coming months more workers are going to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.100
together you know but we're only six million&nbsp;
people and I say that we're only six million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.560
people there are 18 million workers in the UK&nbsp;
that are in trade unions that are organizing their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.140
workplaces and if I can I'll just do a little plug&nbsp;
because we're launching organized now today um at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.140
3 15 and and that is designed to support these 18&nbsp;
million people that have got no idea what a trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.780
Union is no idea where to start organizing their&nbsp;
workplace make that first step because nobody else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.960
is going to do it for us the Tories are out&nbsp;
they're not bothered they just want to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.420
the rich friends richer I can say this is a as a&nbsp;
general secretary of a disaffiliate a trade Union&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.920
but the labor party and Leadership aren't going to&nbsp;
do anything for us either workers and communities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.400
are going to have to come together you're going&nbsp;
to have to stand together I'm going to have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:59.460
organize and demand better because that's the&nbsp;
only way that we're going to make change oh okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.720
um now I'm going to move on to that little budget&nbsp;
yesterday though it wasn't it was a mini budget&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.680
or something like that um I know that because&nbsp;
he wasn't allowed to get drunk while he did it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.820
apparently because it wasn't a proper budget but&nbsp;
you're allowed to get drunk if you are doing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.520
budget one of these wonderful quirks we have in&nbsp;
our ridiculous parliamentary system at times so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.120
um that came in yesterday now that was strayed&nbsp;
out of trickle down they aren't pretending anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.860
one of the things that I would have loved to&nbsp;
have seen in the mainstream media is a comment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.020
read that austerity was a lie so we've been&nbsp;
told for years and years that deficits are at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:43.320
these awful things and you can never ever run a&nbsp;
deficit and you've got appeared back which is I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.540
think economic nonsense because without deficits&nbsp;
then you don't have any money at all you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:54.420
like government government spending is public&nbsp;
sector wealth but it's where that money ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:00.000
up that's important they have made a conscious&nbsp;
Choice haven't they say right we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.380
put money into the pockets of the richest&nbsp;
people they're the ones who are struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.000
whether or not they believe that that&nbsp;
wealth will genuinely trickle down

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:17.340
that has proved that austerity was a lie&nbsp;
austerity was done for no reason it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.740
something that was done to us to break down&nbsp;
working-class people to keep people in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.000
place and to make people's lives worse&nbsp;
to reduce the state to reduce Services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.360
because they don't believe in services for&nbsp;
people is that a fair analysis or you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.980
have I have I entirely got it wrong because&nbsp;
what I saw was like tax cuts for rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.080
um there were a few things in there like I would&nbsp;
have reversed the National Insurance rise to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.000
honest because that does affect people badly&nbsp;
although wealthier people benefited more from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.160
from the reduction in that rise anyway like have&nbsp;
a have I got that wrong because I'm talking to an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.160
economist about economics here so I'm starting I'm&nbsp;
starting to think maybe I better shut up so what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.480
do you think Gary first one I encourage people to&nbsp;
talk about economics as much as they can because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.140
hate this space where ordinary people feel like&nbsp;
they're not allowed to speak about it because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.900
ultimately the isolated economics at Oxford right&nbsp;
it's a bunch of rich people there talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.400
things that are going to affect your lives so&nbsp;
let me know your opinions because ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:23.400
it's ordinary people who are on the front line of&nbsp;
this and who get hurt um for me what it shows is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.800
the conservative party kind of pretended to be&nbsp;
ideological about austerity but if you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.600
look at their behaviors but they appear to be&nbsp;
ideological about is increasing inequality because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:41.220
they were anti-austerity uh sorry they were&nbsp;
anti-deficit when a deficit meant a welfare state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:47.100
well-funded education system a welfare NHS well&nbsp;
funded local councils then they were anti-deficits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.780
when deficits meant money to communities the&nbsp;
people the services that were anti-deficit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:57.360
but when a deficit means tax cuts for the rich&nbsp;
tax cuts for Bankers then suddenly they're Pro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.060
deficitly so I think and if you if you look at&nbsp;
what's happened to inequality in the last 15 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.460
years you know the conservative party happy to&nbsp;
move this way and that but they are consistently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.500
massively increasing inequality and you know I&nbsp;
would encourage the labor party and people on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:20.880
left to come back and fight that by having a more&nbsp;
an understanding of the importance of wealth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.860
wealth distribution and who has it because whilst&nbsp;
we argue about whether a deficit is acceptable or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.380
not we're losing our houses we're losing our&nbsp;
NHS we're losing our assets you know you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.180
I'm getting older now but people of my generation&nbsp;
and younger who can afford a house now who could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.500
have I told you the people who can afford that&nbsp;
because look interest rates were not half percent

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.900
or some people don't need a mortgage because&nbsp;
they've got cash I've already told you the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.040
average rich person accumulated 100 to 200&nbsp;
Grand cash in the last three years so now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.120
we're in a situation where if you've got cash&nbsp;
which a lot of rich people do you can buy a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.600
house if you're from an ordinary family&nbsp;
you want to buy a house with a mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:05.520
from your work you can't so I think we need to&nbsp;
we need to wake up and realize this wealthiest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.900
important assets are important and we're&nbsp;
losing it and and they are getting it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.260
you know if we had that awareness then in the last&nbsp;
three years we would have been saying oh my God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.280
how much is the wealth of the rich increasing in&nbsp;
the last three years how is that going to affect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.080
us ultimately if the government gives cash to&nbsp;
rich people like it has been in the last three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.520
years and now it's going to do again you know&nbsp;
cash is not like resources it's not like real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.280
assets cash is what we use to distribute who gets&nbsp;
resources so the big problem here is when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.900
cut taxes ordinary families receive a small cut&nbsp;
in their taxes so maybe you're getting an extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.500
20 30 pounds a week and you're like happy days&nbsp;
I'm getting extra 30 pounds a week whereas the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.520
rich guy down the road who's getting an extra&nbsp;
500 pounds a week you think you're richer But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.960
ultimately money is how we distribute resources&nbsp;
so if you get a tiny bit of cash and the rich get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.300
loads of cash you have more money but you will&nbsp;
get less resources less housing less food less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.980
assets so don't allow yourself to be blinded by&nbsp;
a government which is happy to give you pennies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.060
while it's giving the rich pounds because that&nbsp;
will give you more money and less resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.780
and nothing could make that clearer than what's&nbsp;
happened in the last three years the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.220
gets a lot of money up right and you know the&nbsp;
average amount accumulated was 12 000 pounds right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.600
so an ordinary family you know that's not rich&nbsp;
Mark I've got three four thousand pounds three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.200
four three four thousand pounds is a lot of money&nbsp;
so you're thinking you're winning but the rich got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.760
200 Grand and then how and then house prices&nbsp;
double and the food price goes up 50 and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.260
energy price doubles and you're suddenly thinking&nbsp;
I thought I was richer but actually I'm poorer we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:37.380
need to be smarter here we need to look who has&nbsp;
the wealth who has the assets and don't allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.060
ourselves to be blinded by Gifts of pennies from&nbsp;
a government that is actually robbing Us blind

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:52.140
um from that I keep on thinking as well that like&nbsp;
once you've got money money becomes like money's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:58.260
expensive for poor people and it gives rich people&nbsp;
money so if once once rich people have a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:03.000
cash they can invest that or whatever they call it&nbsp;
they will speculate do all those things and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
money will then return more money to them if you&nbsp;
don't have much money um then you know your money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.180
is expensive to get the the less money you have&nbsp;
the more expensive a loan is you know the the that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:20.640
kind of thing really cause problem or you're on a&nbsp;
meter for your gas like I know that maybe a bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.640
issue at the moment because the direct debits have&nbsp;
gone absolutely um you know crazy as well yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.940
because the government has um slash taxes&nbsp;
rich people so much the financial markets have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.120
massively increased interest rates in response&nbsp;
because they think it's going to be inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.420
when interest rates are going to go up okay so&nbsp;
when the government slash taxes for rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.400
the rich get richer when interest rates go up it's&nbsp;
easy to think that hurts everybody but it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.620
when interest rates go up it hurts people who have&nbsp;
debts and it benefits people who have money okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.340
and who has debts that's ordinary families&nbsp;
with mortgages and it's the government who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.980
has debt okay but we know that the average Rich&nbsp;
individual has increased their cash by 100 to 200&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.480
000 pounds in the last few years so they are&nbsp;
going to make a ton of money for this so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.680
government in giving money to rich people has&nbsp;
pushed the interest rates up which means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:14.520
ordinary families will pay more money every single&nbsp;
month to rich people it's it's it's a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.900
it's a disaster policy every single thing that's&nbsp;
happening is more money out of the pocket ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.100
families ordinary workers Ordinary People and into&nbsp;
the pocket of the rich the super rich who I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.940
add again have never increased their worth more&nbsp;
quickly than they have in the last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.400
yeah it's been a long enough for you because it is&nbsp;
um but one of there were two things that stood out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.860
one not necessarily cost a living crisis related&nbsp;
which was this new legislative bill that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.500
to make sure that an employer can put in a crap&nbsp;
pay offer and then trade unions have got a ballot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.720
it that we know that that's just an attack&nbsp;
on kind of the rmt and and the CWU and unite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.920
um because of the last few months and&nbsp;
and the strikes that have been happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.920
um but the other thing that came out was about um&nbsp;
Universal Credit claimants I've got to apply for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.440
more and better paid jobs or they'll get penalized&nbsp;
I might have read that wrong but that was kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.560
the gist of what I've got I mean how disgusting&nbsp;
is that not only are people being pushed further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.100
into poverty because they've got to wait longer&nbsp;
to get the benefits that they need to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.020
that aren't enough anyway but they're going to&nbsp;
be penalized if they don't get a better paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:28.260
job but actually most jobs these days that are&nbsp;
easy to get a minimum wage so they're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.600
be penalized for getting a minimum wage job that&nbsp;
they're going to lose out on the benefits anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:40.620
but some guy that's you know earning 80 a thousand&nbsp;
pound a year just from being an MP has decided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.540
that they're not working hard enough so they need&nbsp;
it just that that's why I didn't watch it all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.220
yesterday because I would have sat here and ranted&nbsp;
people earning more than 100 exactly as well so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.420
the people that aren't going out and worrying&nbsp;
about how the feed in the family are you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.720
they're just with the fancy yachts and the big&nbsp;
houses are getting even more money and the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:08.520
that are literally scraping by I've got to do more&nbsp;
it just uh it was a difficult day from yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.860
and I know I know I'm not the person who's going&nbsp;
to be affected by it right but are people going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:19.020
accept this I've helped I really did they think&nbsp;
they're going to get away with it and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.180
I I hope people won't I hope people won't but a&nbsp;
friend of mine called me up and he said the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.000
thing he's like well if I'm going to get 20 30&nbsp;
pounds a week maybe my Mick's going to be happy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.480
about that and this is what we need to this is&nbsp;
why we need to educate and let people understand

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.740
you know 12 years ago there's a pandemic&nbsp;
that we've just been through people have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.600
lost loved ones whilst they've been partying&nbsp;
yeah and I think for a lot of people and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.940
is why I'm talking about organizing and stuff&nbsp;
because they don't know what to do there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.060
light at the end of the tunnel you know&nbsp;
things have been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a long time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:58.440
um and it's up to kind of us to say a lot there&nbsp;
is better yeah we've got to come together you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:04.560
got to dig deeper we've got to kind of build the&nbsp;
trenches so to speak because driving this morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.180
here and I dropped my partner off in town and&nbsp;
we saw on this guy on the street and he went you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.440
know what in the next few months we're gonna see&nbsp;
Mama that aren't we and and we are because you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.020
right there's no end to this but we've got to do&nbsp;
stuff it's to me it's it's about telling stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.840
and the problem is for years and years and years&nbsp;
we've been told a story that individualism is good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.960
that people deserve what they get people you know&nbsp;
people who work harder rewarded people who don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.120
work harder the people who end up on the street&nbsp;
and and that is not reality like neoliberalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.780
is the ideology that hates itself you know it's it&nbsp;
says that you know within the neoliberal ideology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.240
they talk about the natural rate of unemployment&nbsp;
don't they they need an unemployed body of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.180
in order to ensure that the wages of ordinary&nbsp;
people are kept down so that they can say right we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.100
can go on in like an unemployed person will come&nbsp;
and get your job and yet they're hid unemployed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.060
people now I would argue that unemployed people&nbsp;
are in the public sector there appears to be an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:08.340
employee to keep keep wages down you know that's&nbsp;
the that's the whole point of them that's their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.800
ideology but they won't admit it and then they go&nbsp;
after unemployed people and say actually you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.780
doing something wrong and people internalize that&nbsp;
and they believe that and everyone like they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.320
looking around they're looking at their next door&nbsp;
neighbor or something like that saying oh do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.300
think he's got a couple more quid than me or I'm&nbsp;
working harder than him and I deserve more rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.920
than looking at the at the top of the hill at the&nbsp;
castle you know the metaphorical castle of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.920
these people with super yachts that you know they&nbsp;
are the the people who are taking the wealth from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.740
our society taking the money taking that 12 000&nbsp;
pounds out of the puppets of every single person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:49.560
in the country and I think the the stories that&nbsp;
you've both told today I think they're incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.080
important that they go out to a mainstream&nbsp;
audience how do we get them out to a mainstream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.800
audience because you know what today it's going to&nbsp;
be absolutely brilliant I'm going to be speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.680
to people who believe what I believe I'm here with&nbsp;
comrades today but there are people out there who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.540
won't be getting this message how do we get to&nbsp;
those how do we change those stories do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.920
Sarah I'm going to come to you because you speak&nbsp;
to these ordinary people all the time in your job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.060
we've got to talk to everybody haven't we&nbsp;
I said I was at South Yorkshire Festival a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:24.180
few weeks ago and I said two things one of the&nbsp;
things was trust will get in and it'll be worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.780
than we've ever seen before she'll make that&nbsp;
she'll look like a lib Dem because she's got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.700
a purpose she's got to make up for boris's&nbsp;
feelings and and she's gonna wit the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.100
um and I miss running because she did um and&nbsp;
the second thing was that we've got to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.380
to people we've got to get back into there a bit&nbsp;
of talking to people anybody and everybody about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.620
about the realities of life not what's being&nbsp;
told on the right-wing media because if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.280
told something often enough for long enough you&nbsp;
believe it don't you and that's what we've had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.140
in this country the right-wing media that's&nbsp;
Friends of the billionaires telling us that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.940
you next door neighbor that don't go to work to&nbsp;
Shaker and the the Polish couple across the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.780
are immigrants stealing me jobs and that's&nbsp;
what people believe and we've got to go out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.220
and and spread the narrative that that's not&nbsp;
right we're all in this together they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.080
not everybody's going to agree with us and&nbsp;
some conversations will be bloody difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.340
because they'll be right-wing you know they'll&nbsp;
they'll be forage supporters and and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.220
but there will be there there will be the most&nbsp;
meaningful conversations because if we can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:31.800
them to understand then we will start to see&nbsp;
change but until we start going outside of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.120
own Echo Chambers and talking to other people&nbsp;
and engaging in those conversations nothing's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.760
going to change because we'll just keep talking&nbsp;
to each other yeah what is this this space of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.940
individualism right I know it's used against us&nbsp;
but look it is becoming clearer and clearer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:54.180
clearer that what is happening is not working for&nbsp;
the vast majority of individuals you know this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.500
is you know for a long time it was people towards&nbsp;
the poor end of the spectrum who are getting hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.060
that's not true anymore look what is happening&nbsp;
now you know if you are bang in the middle exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:09.420
average financial situation you are getting hit&nbsp;
you are getting seriously seriously hit and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.200
know I always think about you know who are the&nbsp;
people who are supporting the conserving fight you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:19.020
know and a lot of the voters are older people you&nbsp;
know and a lot of older people especially property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.700
owning older people up to some degree protected&nbsp;
by their house prices going up I want to find ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.940
to reach out to those people to say listen okay&nbsp;
I know you're protected by house price going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.040
where your kids going to be what your kid's lives&nbsp;
going to be like what your grandkids lives going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.380
to be like you know what I mean I think we need&nbsp;
to find the fact is this is not working and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.420
it's Madness and if we live in a society where&nbsp;
people are thinking me and my family well then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.940
we should win because me and my family has been&nbsp;
destroyed financially for 70 80 of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.440
here so let's find ways to reach those people&nbsp;
and communicate them and say listen this isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.400
working for me this isn't working for you maybe&nbsp;
this doesn't maybe we don't agree on absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.500
everything but we should have a big majority of&nbsp;
the country here who should say look we can it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.380
obvious it's obvious 70 80 of the country are&nbsp;
being driven down house ownership is collapsing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.880
levels of debt are rising to the roof and at the&nbsp;
same time the fastest ever increasing wealth of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.740
the super rich there is a massive opportunity&nbsp;
here to build a coalition based purely on people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.360
whose Financial lives are being smashed you know&nbsp;
what I mean I think we need to find ways to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.440
those people and you know I'm going to use the&nbsp;
opportunity to plug my YouTube channel that I did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.520
there is that everyone is allowed in everyone is&nbsp;
allowed then and all it is about explaining that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.500
to people look you're being hit I'm being hit and&nbsp;
you know the media is going to try and find ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.660
to divide us old versus young men versus women&nbsp;
different ethnicities North versus the South okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.220
and look there are everybody's problems need to&nbsp;
be recognized but I also need to recognize that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.540
we're all getting hit so we need to be able&nbsp;
to come together above that and look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.860
speed with which people's economic lives are being&nbsp;
hurt so I think there's a massive opportunity here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.800
if we can it's building community and building&nbsp;
those relationships you know speak to the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.240
around you and say that we're all getting hit here&nbsp;
I know we don't agree on everything but this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.680
serious and and you are going to see a massive&nbsp;
acceleration decrease in living standards so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.720
we take the opportunity to bring people together&nbsp;
and say look we really need to create some Unity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.600
fight back and yeah find spaces and ways to do it&nbsp;
brilliant and I hope people at home are clipping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.860
this and uh and they're going to put out little&nbsp;
clips of this and share that this with people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.180
because that's a nice way to do it as well we've&nbsp;
just had some great explainers here from you as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:33.360
as panelists um about what the problems are what&nbsp;
the solutions are is going to come next so we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.940
got a few minutes left to talk about what those&nbsp;
Solutions are so like I guess Sarah what would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:46.140
you like to see coming in the next I don't know&nbsp;
from the next government from from the labor party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.760
at the moment what sort of offer are you seeing&nbsp;
because at the moment like they've been very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:59.400
tentative about whether they'd even um oppose that&nbsp;
could in the 45 rate of tax they've been very Coy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.160
about that and I'm like I think that's a that's&nbsp;
an easy one for me yes of course we oppose that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:10.860
um you know and I'll go a lot further with a&nbsp;
lot more wealth but like you know what would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:17.100
you like to see from the next Parliament&nbsp;
so we we've got some clear clear demands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.020
um from the next Parliament we want to see&nbsp;
the minimum wage raise to 15 pounds an hour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.180
um for all workers regardless of age you know you&nbsp;
don't get a discount on nappies if you're a mum at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.960
17 because you're 17 you shouldn't have a discount&nbsp;
on your age when you're doing the same job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:38.640
an outright ban on Zero's contracts how can you&nbsp;
even begin to look at getting a mortgage or rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.780
or even a bloody mobile phone on a contract if you&nbsp;
don't know what I was going to work from one week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:49.560
to an X we want sick pay at 100 from day one so&nbsp;
if you are unfortunate enough to be ill you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.900
still afford to pay your bills and that's less&nbsp;
stress on you than just having to rely on less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.180
than 100 pound a week um what else and a right&nbsp;
to food for everyone and part of that includes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:06.600
free School meals for all children up until the&nbsp;
age of 18 and that might sound kind of radical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.160
but if you've got to go to school until you're 18&nbsp;
because that's what the law says they should feed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.140
you whilst you're there and that again would&nbsp;
release some disposable income because you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.820
being paid 15 pounds an hour um to be able to&nbsp;
spend in the local economy and it would make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.620
a difference because it'd be normal people that&nbsp;
have got that money not not the rich billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.200
um do I think it's going to happen I think I might&nbsp;
be thinking Pie in the Sky with the labor party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.600
but that's why what we would like to see and we've&nbsp;
seen over the last couple of years that that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.060
can be spent you know and it should but it should&nbsp;
be spent on working people and and our communities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.080
are not giving billions to dodgy companies that&nbsp;
aren't going to do what they say they're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.580
to do yeah I always say them you know give them&nbsp;
money to give money to someone who works in a shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.840
or a builder or something like that it's going&nbsp;
to get spent a nurse a teacher they'll spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.500
their money give it to a billionaire and ends up&nbsp;
in the Cayman Islands you know and that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.000
the government have just done but at least they&nbsp;
can't say to us if they were sitting here now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.080
they would have absolutely no leg to stand on for&nbsp;
saying how are you going to pay for that because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:15.480
they have just paid out of public money for a&nbsp;
huge huge increase in wealth of the wealthiest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:22.200
never again will we accept that argument that&nbsp;
they that you know how you're going to pay for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:28.920
this it's it's absolute nonsense Gary what do you&nbsp;
think what would you like to see well I was too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.340
busy looking at the markets and the economics of&nbsp;
yesterday to release the labor response if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.940
have if they're not opposing that they're cutting&nbsp;
the 45 rate I'm very disappointed to hear that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:43.860
um but if they're not going to do it we have to&nbsp;
do it and um we have to explain to people how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.300
this is going to affect them we have to explain&nbsp;
we have to make it as clear as possible clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.560
explanations that Reach people look if you allow&nbsp;
the rich to get richer if you allow inequality to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.180
increase a massive rate that hurts you your family&nbsp;
your kids ability to buy houses your ability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.320
put food on the table your ability to heat your&nbsp;
home you are in a competition for resources with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.280
the very rich and if we give a ton of money to&nbsp;
them and a bit of money to you you'll get hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.560
we need to explain that to people I think that is&nbsp;
if I think if people understood what the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:15.600
held for them and their families economically they&nbsp;
would not accept it 70 80 90 of this country would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:22.440
not accept it so we need to find ways to explain&nbsp;
that to them to cross the divide and then and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.980
the labor party would have to move because if&nbsp;
people understood the importance of inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.600
and of wealth inequality the importance of wealth&nbsp;
wealth inequality to them and their families they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.160
would demand of the labor party do something about&nbsp;
wealth inequality and they would have to do it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.400
you know I always ask what can I do you know if I&nbsp;
can explain to people how serious it is for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.360
lives their future their family's future that we&nbsp;
do something about inequality they would demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.200
of the politicians and then whoever's in charge&nbsp;
they have to move because if the people insist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.600
it then the politicians have to give it so I say&nbsp;
communicate to people clearly to your friends to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.560
your family you know I always say my YouTube tell&nbsp;
your friends tell your families what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.580
if people understood it they wouldn't accept it&nbsp;
and I think that is the way that we can do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:09.120
about future so brilliant thank you to both of you&nbsp;
so I believe that we are coming to the close of&nbsp;&nbsp;
