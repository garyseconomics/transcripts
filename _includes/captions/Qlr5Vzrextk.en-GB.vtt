00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.560
My name is Gary Stevenson former trader and
people's economist this is gary's economics

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.320
today we're going to talk about housing

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.960
okay so there's 5 areas we're going to cover
about housing - number 1 why is it so expensive

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.480
no.2 is it gonna get more expensive
no.3 how that affects people

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.880
no.4 who's winning and who's losing
and no.5 what can we do about it

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.280
so we're gonna go right in with number one
why is it so expensive? now a lot of people

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.160
tend to believe that the reason housing
is expensive is because of the housing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.760
planning policy in the local area - a lot
of people here in London believe&nbsp;that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.760
but the expensiveness of housing is
not a&nbsp;London specific problem

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.480
so i used to work in the&nbsp;city
with people from all over the world

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.280
people in Sydney, Australia think housing is
expensive because of the local planning problems

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.480
people in New York think that,
people in Los Angeles think that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.360
people in Tokyo think that, people in Shanghai
think that, people in Hong Kong think that

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.240
people in Vancouver and Toronto think that
basically in all of the big cities all over the&nbsp;world

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.560
you know i could keep going Mumbai, Rio De&nbsp;Janeiro
everybody thinks that housing is expensive

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.680
because of the local planning policy in that 1 city
once you take a global perspective and you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.520
realize that this is happening in most if not all
of the major cities in the whole world we have to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.160
accept that the expensiveness of housing is not
because specifically of London planning policy

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.280
so it's a global issue housing globally is
expensive not in all cities obviously there

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.560
are parts of the UK where housing has remained
cheaper but in all the major cities it's happening

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.800
so why is this happening why is housing in major
cities all over the world becoming super expensive

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.200
well to understand that we need to take one
more broader step back and realize it's not

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.360
even just housing that has become expensive in
that same period of time the last 13 years since

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.080
the financial crisis most stocks and shares have
risen 400-500% much more even than housing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.200
land prices have increased significantly gold price
has increased significantly even bond prices

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.880
have gone up basically the price of all assets
has increased significantly over that period

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.960
so when we understand this we can see that
it's not actually even specific to housing

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800
so first it's not specific to london and
secondly it's not even specific to housing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.000
what has happened is there's been a massive
increase in basically all long-term assets

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.320
all over the world so why has that happened
well if you watch my other video 'what is wealth'

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.120
and if you haven't watched it yet i recommend
you watch it - we talk about wealth inequality

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.480
increasing significantly and what that does to the
price of housing the price of stocks and shares

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.200
so basically in the last 15, 20, 30 years the period
where housing has become much less affordable

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.400
we've also seen a massive increase in&nbsp;the share
of wealth owned by the very wealthiest&nbsp;people

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.680
the top 0.1% the extremely wealthy families
now when wealthy families own assets

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.200
that means they get a lot of income from the rest
of us because all of those assets give an income

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.920
and they tend not to spend that income they tend
to save that income so as inequality has increased

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.840
more and more income has gone from ordinary
people to the super rich and they use that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.120
to buy assets that means we can expect to see as
wealth inequality increases a fall in the prices

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.880
of goods and services and wages because that's
what ordinary people spend their money on

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.960
&amp; an increase in the price of assets, stocks, shares, land,
gold, other precious metals and importantly housing

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.040
and that's basically what we've seen as we've seen
inequality, wealth inequality that is, increase

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.600
significantly we've seen a massive increase
in basically the price of broadly all assets

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.000
and that's because purchasing power&nbsp;has
moved away from ordinary people who

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.040
buy goods and services which drives your wages
and towards very wealthy people who buy assets

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.960
so if that's what's happening inequality
is pushing the price of assets up including

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.000
housing and goods and services down why
haven't goods and services prices fallen why

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.840
haven't wages fallen well that's because there's
basically two effects going on at the same time

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.320
firstly increasing inequality pushes house
prices up and wages down but secondly at the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.760
same time since 2008 central banks all over the
world have been massively increasing the amount

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.160
of money in the economy they've been printing
huge amounts of money pushing into the economy

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.480
i talk about this a lot more in my videos on 'Covid-19
and money printing' and when central banks print

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.360
a lot of money that pushes the price of everything up
so we've got 2 things happening at the same&nbsp;time

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.360
on the one hand increased inequality pushes
house prices up &amp; wages down on the other hand

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.240
more money in the system pushes the price
of everything up the net net balance is

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.080
wages &amp; shop prices stay about the same and
house prices and asset prices go through the roof

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.920
so the expensiveness of housing is caused by two
things happening at the same time significantly

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.440
increased wealth inequality and it's important
to understand we're not talking about income

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.000
inequality this is not about doctors and lawyers
this is about wealth going to the super wealthy

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.360
families who own huge amounts of assets and at the
same time money printing wealth inequality pushes

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.000
house prices up, money printing pushes house prices
up, house price goes to the roof but at the same&nbsp;time

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.320
wealth inequality pushes wages down so
the net effect is house prices go up and your

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.360
wages stay the same that is why housing is expensive

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
number two
is housing going to get more expensive?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.520
short answer yes - if you watched my videos on
Covid you'll see that it has caused a massive

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.240
increase in both wealth inequality and money
printing that means we can expect to see housing

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.440
get significantly more unaffordable
and expensive&nbsp;in years ahead

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.040
now number three and number four

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.800
how does this affect you and who wins and who
loses now economists who often come from rich

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.520
families that own property like to think that
when house prices go up it benefits the economy

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.640
people see the house price rise they feel richer
they spend more money homeowners also often

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.840
like it when they see the value of their houses go up
but who loses out here? well the obvious group is

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.120
young people from poor and ordinary families
right people from rich families they can often

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.440
get significant deposits from their parents but
people from ordinary families when the house price

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.640
goes up and the wage doesn't it can become very
difficult or even impossible to buy a property

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.720
that means much longer in rented accommodation
which is expensive and if they are able to save

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.040
up a deposit then they'll have to take a much
bigger mortgage which will mean higher repayment

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.640
over a longer period of time so younger people are
losing the money every month because of this more

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.560
expensive house prices either through having
to pay rent or having to pay a bigger mortgage

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.920
when this happens they can easily respond by
thinking i've got to save up a lot more money

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.520
i'll have to spend less and that
can actually damage the economy

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040
but let's talk about older people from ordinary
families who may already own their own property

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.800
right these guys often think that they're winning
when house prices go up but the only way that you

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.400
can get the money from the house price going up
is by selling the property now if you sell your

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.880
property and spend the money then that means you
can't give your kids money to buy their property

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.920
now we've already said that when house prices
go up that means kids from rich families can get

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.480
deposits from their parents but kids from ordinary
families can't and that means often they can't

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.640
get property at all so if you're a parent from an
ordinary family you own your own property you see

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.120
the house prices go up and you think you're richer
the only way you can actually get that money is by

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680
selling the property and that's going to mean that
your kids and your grandkids will never be able

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.160
to own property at all so for ordinary families
they find themselves in a bind where they feel

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.960
richer because the house price is going up but the
only way for them to actually make that money is

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.320
to sell the property which will mean their kids and
their grandkids will never own property again

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.400
i can see this happening with the families around
me kids from richer families their parents are

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.360
able to remortgage their properties or access the
stocks and shares they have to give big deposits

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.920
to their kids and help them get onto the property
ladder but kids from poorer families their parents

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.480
need that money to help them get through
retirement and it means that kids from richer

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.040
families win and kids from poorer families end up
completely losing access to property forever so

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.240
the winners here are rich families who&nbsp;have
a lot of property big portfolios of stocks

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.640
and shares which are also going up and the losers
are ordinary families who are losing their houses

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.720
so as ordinary families lose their properties
and kids from richer families able to buy them

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.280
inequality gets even worse driving house prices
up further still this creates a worsening spiral

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.480
which makes housing increasingly unaffordable
to ordinary people that brings us to the last&nbsp;thing

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480
(No.5) how do we fix it?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.800
okay so what do we do? this problem is
caused by inequality so the&nbsp;only way to

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.480
fix it is by fixing inequality not by taxing&nbsp;ordinary
working people but by taxing the super rich

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.200
the government doesn't want you&nbsp;to
know this because it's run by people with

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.920
wealth of £100 million or even sometimes over
£1 billion - these people get huge amounts of

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.840
cash flows from us ordinary people to them which
they use to buy houses that our kids need and

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.640
often they do it whilst paying almost no tax
this can't continue we have to end it

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.760
push for wealth taxes on super rich people, educate
yourselves, watch my videos about Covid &amp; Inequality

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.560
watch my videos about what is wealth
tell your friends, tell your mum, let's make it happen
