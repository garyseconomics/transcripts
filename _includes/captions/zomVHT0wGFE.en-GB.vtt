If you don't fix wealth inequality then we have
 
to have high taxes on the middle class&nbsp;and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.960
bad education, bad healthcare, bad welfare&nbsp;state
 
you know you get the worst of all possible&nbsp;worlds

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.040
The reason i think that wealth inequality is
 
the most important thing in the economy is um

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.560
basically because all the other problems
 
housing, lack of good jobs, lack of good wages

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.120
government debts, government deficits, not enough
 
money for good quality education, health care

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.800
these are basically all being caused by
 
problems with wealth equality and i didn't

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.480
i didn't really go into work in the city with the
 
idea that i was gonna, as an inequality campaigner

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.680
basically i wasn't a campaigner i just wanted to
 
i wanted to be able to forecast well &amp; to make money

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.440
and um it needs to be understood that markets and
 
economists are continually forecasting incorrectly

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.840
um so they're missing something that's very
 
important there's something very important

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.120
that they don't understand and uh things continually
 
fail to improve because they're missing something

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.120
and having studied economics at university
 
and then gone on to work in the city

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.880
i can see that these guys don't
 
understand the significance of inequality

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.080
and because of that they've been constantly
 
struggling to understand why there's not

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.480
enough spending and demand in the economy and um
 
once you understand that the problem is spending

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.480
and you also understand that most ordinary
 
people are basically most ordinary people

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.120
they spend everything they make in their lives
 
right the vast the vast majority of people die

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.720
with nothing left they spend everything and
 
yet we've got a problem of not enough spending um

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.880
so for years i sort of struggled to understand how
 
can we get this spending and um it basically&nbsp;if

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.880
if governments are governments are already
 
overextending they're borrowing to spend

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.160
ordinary people are borrowing to spend, the only
 
people who can&nbsp;inject that demand into the economy

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.280
is the rich basically

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.120
but i think all of the other political&nbsp;demands
 
that people want - more affordable housing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.480
better jobs, a stronger economy in a variety of
 
ways they simply are not affordable unless you

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.760
fix inequality specifically wealth inequality um
 
but if you do fix wealth inequality basically

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.520
anything becomes affordable so it drives me mad
 
that economists don't talk about inequality more

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.320
but i guess i should be grateful that they
 
don't because that's why i've been able to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.320
make so much money because their predictions
 
are always wrong and mine are always right but

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.360
we simply cannot build a better society
 
without the wealth of the super rich

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.120
and if we don't do anything then not only will we
 
not access their wealth but they will continue to

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.680
progressively take more and more of our wealth
 
so really i'm not saying it's the only thing

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.240
that matters in the world of course it's not but
 
in terms of the economy basically nothing else is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.560
possible unless we fix wealth inequality so it's
 
the it's the cornerstone it's the foundation stone

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.280
we need to fix wealth inequality and then all&nbsp;the
 
other questions we can ask and we can&nbsp;answer

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.960
do you want a big welfare state? okay well
 
you can have one if you fix wealth inequality if

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.160
you don't then you can't have one, okay well do you
 
want low taxes? well you can have them if you fix

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.280
wealth inequality, well if you don't then you can't
 
have them, if you don't fix wealth inequality then

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.880
we have to have high taxes on the middle class&nbsp;&amp;
 
bad education, bad healthcare, bad welfare&nbsp;state

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.600
you know you get the worst of all possible&nbsp;worlds
 
whereas if you fix wealth inequality then you know

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.440
like we could build, we could have that&nbsp;15 hour
 
week if we wanted to or we could have

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.480
100 hour week and we could be phenomenally rich
 
you know what i mean but if you don't fix wealth

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.600
inequality then the direction of travel is&nbsp;downwards
 
basically and that doesn't that&nbsp;doesn't end

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.880
there's nothing within the system that&nbsp;automatically
 
fixes that so you know i believe that capitalism

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.680
can be a great system and it can&nbsp;provide
 
great human outcomes but if you don't fix

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.520
wealth inequality we will get bad outcomes for the
 
vast majority of people, so it's not a question of

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.240
do i think it's the most important thing i think
 
nothing else is possible if you don't fix it

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.040
so um yeah we need to get people people
 
behind it and um it's important to understand

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.920
that the economists don't realize that
 
most economists don't realize that

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.080
but it's also important to understand that most
 
economists come from wealthy families and

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.000
they own property so they're not being hurt
 
by it and they're well paid so unfortunately

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.960
it falls upon ordinary people who are the people
 
getting hurt to come out and fight for it

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.920
um and people need to come out and fight for it
 
people need to come out and say we're not gonna

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.000
we need to start demanding explicitly from
 
governments - measure wealth inequality and

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.240
make sure it's decreasing - because it's increasing and
 
as much as that happens then less and less will be

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.200
politically and economically possible
 
in terms of getting society more...

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.640
housing could be so much more affordable wages
 
could be so much higher and we could have so

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.960
many more options in how we live our lives some
 
of them put a lot of money into paying economists

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.080
and think tanks to tell you that inequality
 
is important for the economy that is not true
