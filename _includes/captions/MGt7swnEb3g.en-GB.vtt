00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Okay.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.520
Today, we are going to do something different

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.080
and we're going to have a guest on the channel,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.920
an economist for the very first time.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.000
One of my favorite economists working today.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.120
I very often get asked on this channel,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.960
where else can we go to learn about economics?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.640
What other stuff can we read?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.800
How can we learn more?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.280
And there are a lot of

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.080
economists who I like working today.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.520
There's obviously a couple of

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.320
French guys working on inequality-

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.080
Piketty and Zucman.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.200
But the person who I always recommend, because I

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.320
think he is the best at writing about economics

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.680
in a way that is accessible and relatable for

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
ordinary people is today's guest on the channel.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.400
So I'd like to welcome Ha-Joon Chang.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.040
Thank you.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.720
Thank you very much

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.440
for coming.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.360
I think I'll just introduce briefly

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.880
how we met and how I got to know you.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.880
So, I quit banking in 2014, and when I came back, I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.160
was sort of looking about how can I change the economy.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.040
And I didn't really know much about the work getting

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.240
done in economics today, and I got invited to a small,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.000
what can I say, lecture series that you were doing?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.040
Yeah.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.400
Yeah.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.640
When was it?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160
Was it 2015, perhaps?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.120
'15, '16, I forget.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.640
2015,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.760
I was invited to a lecture series which you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.760
gave to a smaller audience, and I was lucky to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.920
watch a few lectures you gave about

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.880
how, I think it was How Poor Countries Become Rich.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.800
And I was very impressed at the time about

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.320
basically how you seemed to have thought the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.080
problems through and delivered answers rather than

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.920
kind of relying on rigidly mathematical models.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.480
That's kind of you.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.040
And I was very impressed at basically how

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.480
you were just able to communicate ideas in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.800
a way that ordinary people would understand.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.760
So, was very impressed, and I'm very happy

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.600
to have you as the first guest on the channel.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.640
Thanks.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680
Yeah, actually those lectures have

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.640
been made into this lecture series called

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.280
Economics For People and available on INET

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.720
website, The Institute for New Economic Thinking.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.040
Yes.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.360
I sometimes get people tweet photos of me

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.840
asking you a question, saying, "Oh, here's-"

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.360
That's right, you asked some sharp questions.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.920
Yeah.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.200
Looking, looking younger and fresher,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560
less jaded by politics.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.880
So would you be able to introduce yourself a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.480
little to the audience, talk a little bit about

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.360
why you chose to study economics, when you started, why

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.400
you chose to move to the UK to study,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.680
because I know this is not where you're from

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.000
originally.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.560
That's right.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm Ha-Joon Chang.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.680
I'm a professor at SOAS,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.880
University of London, at the moment.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.640
I used to teach in Cambridge for over three decades.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760
I've moved to SOAS recently.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.080
Yes, I was born in South Korea in 1963.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.720
That was right at the beginning of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.080
the country's so-called economic miracle.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080
And, you know, really that was where

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.760
I grew up and when I grew up that I wanted to study

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.080
economics, because, you know, at the time, South Korea

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.800
was growing at like 10%, 12%, sometimes at 15.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.480
This is when you were sort of in your teens?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.960
That's... Yeah, that's right,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.280
In the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.720
'60s and '70s, yeah.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.040
And yeah, I mean, the, people's living standards

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.760
were rising really rapidly and, you know, the new

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.040
buildings going new towns are forming.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.840
Yeah, so there were a lot of good things

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.880
going on then because, you know, at that, level

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.320
of income, you know, the South Korea's income,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280
per, per capita income, you know, for example, in

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.160
the, the ni- early 1970s when I was a primary

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.800
school student was like, $400, yeah?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.720
Yeah, so I think...

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.960
It was a very poor country-

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.080
Yeah.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400
... which meant that this economic growth

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.360
really, was literally

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600
a matter of life and death, you know.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.080
Yeah.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.600
Because that, in that, at that

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600
level of development, if your economy grows at

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.160
5% rather than the 1%, it means that,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.320
you eat one more bowl of rice

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.360
Was it still like a very agricultural economy-

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.600
at that time.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.440
but you know, like 60... 50-60% of

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.240
people were in the countryside, engaged in farming.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.000
But, also because the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.560
country was industrialising rapidly

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.360
literally millions of people were arriving

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.280
in Seoul, the capital city, and Busan,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.200
Ulsan, these industrial cities in the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.000
Southeast to find jobs in factories, yeah?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.680
But the life was very hard for the workers,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.560
you know, because, this was a time when

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.240
these workers are working 13, 14 hours a day,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.480
six and a half days a week.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.920
In factories, in cities?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.600
Ye- yeah.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.240
Exactly, yeah.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.760
And some factories refused to

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.120
serve soup in the canteen so that they don't

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.680
have to give extra toilet break,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.160
No, no.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.920
this was a very, very harsh time.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.560
Yeah.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.480
But, you know, things

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.040
were improving.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.840
On the other hand, you know, you had

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.160
these workers you know, being

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.080
worked to death, and, you know, slums

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.400
springing up in urban areas, and then the-

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.640
Okay.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.720
... property developers mobilising

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.160
these thugs to beat people up,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.280
to clear illegal settlements.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.000
So you've got this rapidly urbanising and, like, growth

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.840
is high, incomes are growing, but living standards

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.360
are still really poor for a lot of people,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.560
That's right.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.440
the cities are growing in sort of slum fashion.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.600
Yeah.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.160
Exactly.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.560
And then there were a lot of tension because,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.960
you know, the country was between 1961 and

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.800
'87 ruled by a military dictatorship.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.880
Even though this military government,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.720
was able to engineer this rapid

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.640
economic development into the very brutal-

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.080
yeah.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.080
And as I grew up, I just, I wanted to

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.280
understand what's going on around me.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.640
And you, you're, you were growing

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.520
up in, like, a middle-class family?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.800
In Seoul?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.840
That's right, yeah.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.720
My father was a high ranking civil servant,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.320
in the Ministry of Finance, and yeah.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.200
I mean, okay, I mean,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.160
we were not rich, but, well off, yeah?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.720
I guess by the standards of a career

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.320
which was quite poor at the time.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.120
Yeah.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.280
So, when I was a kid, our house was the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.720
only house in the neighborhood with a TV, you know?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.560
Okay.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.080
So people went to... came to our

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.720
house to watch a football matches,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.240
a boxing match.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.360
So you were witnessing, I guess, it

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.160
sounds like a period of really rapid economic change

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.520
and economic growth, and, like,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.640
that interested you and excited you.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.240
That's right, yeah.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.440
So there were a lot of positive things

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.480
happening, but, also a lot of negative things, yeah?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.960
I mean, this

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.520
exploitation of workers, you know?

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.560
Yeah.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.520
Political repression, you know?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.400
It's interesting to hear you talk about the, like, the

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.560
rapidly growing cities and the rapidly growing slums

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.280
because obviously at the moment, we have

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.960
a government that is obsessed with growth,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.200
and they want to build, they want

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
to build, they want to build.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.320
And, I come from, like, a

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.520
very poor part of East London.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.040
Yeah.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.840
And I'm seeing, you know, I'm sure it's not the

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.120
same, but I'm seeing this, like, rapid growth

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.320
of these poorer outer London suburbs,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.000
and basically turning into slums.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.320
Yeah.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.680
I was saying before, the Daily

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.120
Mail went to my house last week.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.640
And I think they wanted to do, like, the

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.800
house I grew up in, and they wanted to do a story

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.120
like, "Oh, you know, Gary said he was poor, but he's

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.360
actually not." And the story they actually wrote

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.160
was, "Oh my God, this place is a slum." They

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.480
couldn't believe it. so it's interesting to see

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.120
You know, And I often worry that this like,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.080
this rapid, like, move for growth

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.600
will lead to the slumification of London.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.320
No, I mean, of course, I mean,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.480
it was worse in Korea at the time because

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.760
the general living standard was lower.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.440
But yeah, I mean, if you, expand too fast

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.720
these builders are not going to build

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.760
houses of good standard.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.080
Yeah, and of course, we're only a few years

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.680
out from the Grenfell disaster, you know?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.120
Exactly.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
I sometimes worry that this, "Let's slash the

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.560
red tape," sometimes feels shocking to me.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:36.720
Yeah.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.080
I mean, the housing problem has to be

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.000
solved by, you know, the regulation and the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.960
more equal distribution of assets, I mean, you

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.440
cannot solve it by building more houses.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.800
It seems a bit naive to me.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.840
But let's get back to, you're a child in Korea.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.920
It was my fault. You're interested

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.720
in economics, and you decide that you,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.040
you moved to, in the UK when you were 18?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.160
No, no, no, no.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.560
Actually, I went to university in Korea.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.920
Okay.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.480
In Seoul?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:07.920
Yeah.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.360
So we studied economics, and,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.000
yeah, some professors were different,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.920
but most of the professors were just

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.640
teaching this equilibrium models, you know?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.800
The similar models to what I would have learned.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.200
Exactly.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.520
Mathematically less sophisticated,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.840
but the same idea.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.160
Yeah.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.480
Okay.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.720
So just these are like basically

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
very mathematically, mathematically complex,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.960
mathematical equilibrium models, not so much

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.840
stuff on the history of economic thought, perhaps?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.200
Yeah.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.640
We had a course in the history of economic thought.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.560
And you don't mind me asking,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.880
what years would

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.680
you have been studying in Korea?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.880
Yeah.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.720
So I entered university in 1982.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.400
Okay.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.400
And graduated in 1986, and came to England in

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.000
the summer of '86 to start my master's.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.760
Okay, just before was born.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840
I'm old, yeah.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.560
So well, I, yeah, entered the university,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.640
most of the professors were, you know,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.040
teaching this abstract...

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.800
In Seoul?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.200
Yeah, Seoul National University.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.880
And many of my friends couldn't take it

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.840
seriously, you know, because, there's this huge

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.720
upheaval going on outside the classrooms, you know?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.000
Economic development, export success,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.840
political repression, you know?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:21.880
Yeah.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.040
In 1980, the second military government

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.600
committed this massacre in

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.160
actually my father's hometown killing

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.840
thousands of people who are protesting against

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.040
the coup d'etat and, you know?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.800
So, a lot of us got interested in

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.240
finding out whether there's

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.480
another way of thinking about economics.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.880
So you went into university.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.880
And you got very interested in economics, and

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.200
you were kind of almost amused by

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.760
your university basically doing maths.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.120
That's right.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.040
And there's not much discussion of, there's

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.520
all of this crazy stuff happening, you know?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.800
Exactly.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.680
This is, you know, one of the great

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.080
modern economic miracles, right?

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.760
at this period of Korean economic growth.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.160
Yeah.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.000
So you kind, you kind of thought...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.800
I mean, I had a similar thing, really.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.920
Like you sort of, you, I think sometimes

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.000
people are really amazed when I tell them,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.720
we don't talk about the housing crisis.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.320
That's right, yeah.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.240
And we don't, we don't talk

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.440
about the cost of living crisis.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.480
Uh-uh.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.120
What we do is maths.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.520
Yeah.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.080
And I did my undergrad in the mid-2000s.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.200
Yeah.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.240
And I did my post-grad 2017 to '19.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.680
Yeah, and while you were

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.880
doing this, there's

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.280
one of the biggest financial

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.640
crises in the history of capitalism.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.160
Yeah.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.320
And many professors-

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.440
I'm kind of surprised to hear

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.760
that even, you know, this is 30 years earlier

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.480
in Korea.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.480
You were also doing this very, very

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.720
heavily mathematised form of study.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.400
That's right, yeah.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.240
Okay.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.960
Yeah, so I just wanted to study something

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.800
different, and I found out that there were a

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.160
few universities in England and the United States

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.400
where you could study non-Neoclassical economics,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.880
Marxist economics, development economics,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.360
So, just to make clear,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.680
we're talking, you didn't want to do just this

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.120
kind of very specific heavily mathematised.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.600
That's what you mean when you say Neoclassical?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.040
Yeah, yeah, I mean already Neoclassical

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.280
economics was very heavily mathematised.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.080
So Neoclassical is basically like the...

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.000
at the moment at elite universities there's

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.080
kind of one... there's basically there's one-

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.880
Exactly, yeah.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.760
one kind of economics that you're taught

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.080
almost, from my perspective, almost as if

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.480
it's like physics, like a physical science.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.120
That's right, yeah.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.080
So this is a particular approach to economics

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.920
which assumes that the world is made up of

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.000
this selfish rational individuals, and they,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.520
you know, try to get ahead and compete with

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.640
each other, and that's what generates wealth and-

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.320
And in particular, what I often

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.160
talk about on this channel

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.160
is that these models, these kind of

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.880
large-scale heavily mathematical models,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.360
they tend to use what they call representative agency.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.640
Which means that rather than talking about, we have

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.960
whatever 60 million people in the UK or 40 million

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.360
people in Korea, you just look at the average.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.680
You say let's look at one guy, the

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.120
average guy, the representative guy.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.800
Which of course means

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.960
there is no inequality.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.240
Exactly, by definition,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.800
There's no equality in distribution.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.920
And you were studying the... that was the

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.720
same thing you would have been studying.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.240
Yeah, exactly, and yeah, still

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.080
laughing when I, remember that incident

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.080
you know, these models that really

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.440
came on stream in a major way in the 1980s,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.960
because yeah, before it was more of

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.400
a general equilibrium and that, that kind of stuff

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.720
and, yeah, it, in my early days in Cambridge,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.880
someone was, giving a... a seminar

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.480
using this representative agent model.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.880
Yeah.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.440
He also added this assumption that

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.240
this agent is non-infinitely lived.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.360
Okay, well, I'm glad to hear it.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.560
We are like looking at this guy and

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.120
one of us asked, "What does that mean,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.760
'non-infinitely lived'?" And another guy said,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.920
"Well, I guess it means that we all die in the end."

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.280
Yeah.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.760
You know what mean?

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:27.800
Yeah.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.520
There's no sense of realism there.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.880
I mean, just whatever makes it

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.200
mathematically neat.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.520
Yeah.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.160
I wondered, so-

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.800
You say

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.160
moved to Cambridge in '86?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.640
Exactly, yeah.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.360
To do your post grad, masters?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.440
That's right, masters and PhD, and then I

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.400
studied with Professor Bob

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.280
Rowthorn who was a famous Marxist economist.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.800
Okay.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800
Yeah, although, I mean, he

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800
did lots of other things and,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.680
he didn't insist that, I follow his approach, so my

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.080
approach is a bit different, from him, but

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.800
I really thank him for, kind of showing me different

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.680
types of economics and, you know, teaching

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.960
me how to kind of reconcile them if I have to and...

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.320
So you chose to go to Cambridge because you

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.560
thought that Cambridge was teaching

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.280
like a more like diverse range of-

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.560
That's right,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.520
ways of looking at economics?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.360
Yeah, that, at that time Cambridge was of

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.800
course at the bastion of Keynesian economics.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.160
Okay.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.800
Can you just quickly describe what

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.120
that means to our viewers who might not know.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.600
Yeah, Keynesian economics is economics

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.200
that was kind of invented by the early

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.720
20th century British economist John

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.880
Maynard Keynes, who... well like you, made

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.760
a lot of money in the financial market.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.080
He's one of a few economists who actually

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.960
makes money in the financial market

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.840
because surprisingly many economists that

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.080
when they invest in financial market

00:15:59.680 --> 00:15:59.800
they fail.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.840
Not so surprising to me.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.640
But he was rooted in, so I think

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.360
one of the best economists of all time.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.040
And he lived through The Great Depression.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.680
That's right, yeah.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.200
So his argument was look, you cannot treat

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.640
the economy as a household, yeah?

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:16.720
Yeah.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.360
That is the mistake that the

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.320
current Labour Government is making, yeah?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.560
We've maxed out

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.920
our credit card, you know, we cannot spend more.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.840
Of course you can, but

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.960
the point is that...

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.840
He's basically saying, if you tax people,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.800
like tax working people more and you don't... the

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.840
government stops spending, you'll basically cause

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.120
this kind of economic depression which is that

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.000
there's not enough spending, businesses will fail.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.640
Then more people will lose their jobs.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.680
And, well yeah, this is-

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.640
Yeah, so his point was you know,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.640
that your income is my spending, you know.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.200
My spending is your income, yeah.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.600
Although we're kind of in this weird situation

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.800
in the UK now where we have a government that

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.120
seems to want to spend but is kind of not able

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.720
to spend and we'll discuss more on this.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960
But, so basically I think the point

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.840
you're making is at universities, especially

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.640
elite universities, economics is kind of taught

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.080
like there's this one way of doing things.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.560
Exactly.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.240
Which you're calling Neoclassical,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.560
neoliberal, which is this very highly

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.760
mathematised, rational individuals, we look

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.520
at the averages, but there are other ways of

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.840
thinking about things like Keynesianism, Marxist

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.760
economics.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.400
And you wanted to, I guess, study a wider

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.560
variety so that's why you went to Cambridge.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.600
Absolutely, yeah.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.800
Cambridge was, you know, Neoclassical

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.560
economics was not so dominant until the

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.080
1950s and '60s, but from the '70s it started

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.000
really pushing out other schools because they

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.040
are more kind of, accepting of the status quo.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.360
They don't

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.120
ask awkward questions, yeah?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.400
So it was that really becoming

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.280
dominant, but there was still in the '80s

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.000
a few places here and there where

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.120
Neoclassical economics was not dominant.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.720
Cambridge was one of those places.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.360
Is Cambridge still like that now?

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.120
No.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.760
Okay.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.000
Because when I... so I went to London

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.200
School of Economics, 2005 to 2008, and

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.560
really to be honest, I was not, I was not

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.920
even really aware that there were other ways-

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.680
Exactly, yeah.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.080
No, no, that's how it is, these days and, you know.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.320
Yeah.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.200
So I deliberately

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.560
wanted to come to Cambridge.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.160
Luckily I got accepted, but you know, when

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.800
I told people that I want to study in

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.320
England, I mean, a lot of people in Korea-

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.080
Your friends and-

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.160
just couldn't understand it because

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.560
you know, we had no historic

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.840
relationship with England, so studying

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.640
abroad meant 90% going to the US and

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.920
maybe 5% to Germany, 5% to France.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.560
Hardly anyone came to England,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.800
And yeah, I mean, moreover people

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.160
thought wanting to study anything other

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.080
than Neoclassical was career suicide, yeah?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.880
I mean, career hadn't even begun, but you know.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.080
Yeah.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.320
So.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.760
So have you got any advice

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.320
to... We sometimes get messages

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.480
from young people who are studying economics

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.280
or are interested in studying economics.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.640
Sometimes we even get messages from people

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.520
who are really interested in the ideas that we

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.800
talk about on this channel, we talk a lot about

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.360
inequality, and they say, "Where can I

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.680
learn about these things, where should I study?

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.080
is it gonna be a problem if, for me, for like

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.160
career advancement?" What advice would you give to

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.360
young people who are interested in studying

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.000
economics and actually learning about the economy?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.280
Yeah, I mean, it's getting more and more

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.080
difficult to study economics in a kind of pluralistic

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.640
way that accepts different theoretical approaches

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.560
and try to learn the best from all of them,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.640
because most universities will

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.120
teach you a very, very narrow curriculum

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.920
completely

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.840
dominated by mathematics, yeah?

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.040
Yeah.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.280
So basically a lot of people

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.440
want to study economics because they want to

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.880
understand inequality, you know, cost of living crisis,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.080
financial crisis and then they go to

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.760
the university and they don't learn any of

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.800
those, and then they do maths for three years

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.000
and they graduate, you know?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.360
Maybe you could speak a little bit,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.520
because you were teaching at Cambridge

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.320
for quite a long time, right?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.480
As you've been teaching at SOAS so you've

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.280
been an economics professor and teacher

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.640
at universities for a number of years.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.240
Yeah.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.200
My experience of studying economics is when I did

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.800
my undergrad I was at LSE, it's a very elite university.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.800
So lots of wealthy students.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.080
The truth is for me, I found the

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.120
majority of students there on the undergrad,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.040
to be honest,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.480
I think they were not, and I include myself in this.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.480
We were not really that interested in the economy,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.480
really.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.280
We were there because we thought, I think rightly to

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.520
some degree, that economics, especially at an elite

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.920
university like LSE, was a way to get a well-paid

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.000
job.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.240
It is, yeah.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:32.400
So how... What... Is that what you were

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.760
seeing when you were at Cambridge as well?

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.120
But you know, I mean

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.080
there are different people, so the...

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.600
Yeah, even in Cambridge, I would

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.640
say, you know, 30% of the students were

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.600
quite interested in the real world problems.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.360
And Cambridges-

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.240
It's funny that, it's quite a small minority

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.840
but that's the same, I think at LSE

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.760
was probably slightly less.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.920
Yeah, to be fair, Cambridge

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.920
still offers a slightly more diverse

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.040
curriculum than LSE.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.560
It used to be actually very

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.560
real world oriented and diverse

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.240
and so until about 2005, yeah?

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.160
And then does a major curricular reform

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.440
that made it very mathematical and...

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.560
Yeah, so that another story, but, so...

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.560
But the problem is that even

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.440
for those 30%, 35%, I mean-

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.800
That's just the nature of the study, the ma- the

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520
The ability to think about the economy is

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.440
beaten out of them, yeah?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.760
I think, yeah, I think your

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.560
gestures are correct.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.280
So for me, okay, so I well, when I did my

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.000
undergrad I was not interested in economics.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.640
Really.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.640
Other than its ability to get me a good job.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.920
And that was almost everyone at LSE was like that.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.040
But then I went back to do a master's,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.760
at Oxford, '17 to '19, and what's

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.880
interesting about that is the master's is

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.400
not really like necessary to get a good job.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.600
That's true.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.280
If have a good undergrad.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640
So then that means that some of

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.120
the people who did the master's

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.640
a much bigger percentage of them

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.040
were kind of interested in

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.840
economics.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.800
But of course they've all had this experience of,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.400
you go to do your undergrad and maybe you go in quite

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.160
naively thinking, "I'm gonna learn about the economy."

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.120
But the actual experience is you have to do a lot

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.960
of very, very difficult, essentially algebra exams.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.240
Algebra and calculus exams, and, you

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.680
know, it's just like complicated maths.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.600
And then those exams are really hard.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.400
So then you, you don't... Unless you're

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.480
like super smart, you don't really have-

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.520
Time to do anything else.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.640
Yeah, you, you don't have time to step back and be

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.760
like, "Well, you know, does it make sense that we

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.280
don't look at the... have any wealth distribution

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.840
in the model?" You don't really ha- you know,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.760
you need to be, and also if you were to think,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.360
ask those questions, who do you ask them to?

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.960
You know, I was at Oxford.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.200
Oxford had one guy who looked at inequality.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.280
Was his name

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.480
Tony Atkinson?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.400
Yeah.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.160
And he died

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.280
1 year before I entered.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.720
Yeah, so I applied with the hope...

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.160
He was a yeah, very influential

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.040
economist in the field of inequality study.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.760
I think Piketty was quite an influence.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.160
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.880
So by the time I got there, there was not

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.920
even anybody to speak to about inequality.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.120
And then, and, you know, you have to,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.280
you have to study really hard.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.480
And, you know, I didn't really

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.520
care about my grades in master's

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.400
but, you know, it does whip it out of you,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.720
because if you, if you, you have to

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.360
do so much maths and it's difficult.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.880
Yeah.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.880
And there's... and it kind of whips out

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.320
anyone who actually wants to ask these

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.360
big questions, it's like, well, everyone

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.000
else is doing 100 hours a week of maths.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.000
And you're sitting around asking stupid questions.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.800
That's right, yeah.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.960
Yeah, so I think it does kind of whip,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.400
and I thought it was really, really sad.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.800
Like, I thought the smartest kids

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.240
on that Oxford post-grad course

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.080
they all dropped out of economics.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.080
Because it was like, well, the guys were curious.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.200
It was so clear there is no space here for people

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.800
who are curious about the economy.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.480
Yeah.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.120
This conversation reminds me of what the radical

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.600
Keynesian economist, Joan Robinson said.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.760
I mean, Robinson was one of the few...

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.280
Was she at Cambridge?

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.560
... Yeah,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.920
female economist, yeah, was a big

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.880
name in the Keynesian economics.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.600
I mean, she should have got greater

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.280
recognition, but she was very left-wing

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.280
and asked a lot of awkward questions, and

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.160
yeah, therefore she was pushed back.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.480
But she once famously said

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.920
that, "I had to learn to think because I

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.840
wasn't all that good at math," you know?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360
Yeah.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.880
I think it, I think it, yeah.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.320
Sometimes, maths becomes

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.360
substitution for thinking, yeah?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.560
Yeah, well, I think, no, I think

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560
that's a really good point.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.680
I think that's a really good point.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.880
The obsession, it's insane, Because you

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.760
know, especially for that Oxford post-grad.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.400
You know, it's very difficult to get into,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.840
Oxford's a very prestigious university.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.840
These are really, really smart kids, and

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.880
the reality of it is we spent two years

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.440
locked in tiny windowless rooms inverting matrices.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:06.920
That's right.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.440
It's insane.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.280
It really, really is insane, but I think this,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.720
I want to make this point to our viewers.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.920
because the point I often make is, you know,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.680
at the end of the day, these are the guys

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.960
who are controlling the economy,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.680
making the decisions about the economy and-

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.480
It's quite worrying, isn't it, yeah?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.600
Well, the other point that I make is, and this

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.760
something I wanted to ask you about, was so when

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.000
I did my undergrad, I think LSE is probably the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.840
worst for this, but I don't think it's unusual at all.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.800
The vast majority of the students wanted to be traders.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.040
Or at the very least to work in finance.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.640
And the vast majority of the students with

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.320
the best grades did go on to become traders.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.080
Does that mirror with what you've seen

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.200
as a professor watching students go through?

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.640
Yeah.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.280
I mean, you cannot blame them,

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.680
you know, they've...

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.720
No, I did it myself.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.400
That's right.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.440
Going into trading, I mean, you will be

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.640
making five, ten times what you could be

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.920
making in any other uh, possible uh, profession

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.400
The civil service or whatever.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.200
So that is natural, yeah?

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.640
But, you know, the trouble is when

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.800
you train people in this particular way, basically

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.480
maths, and then put them in charge of the economies,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.880
a bit like

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.960
training people in, say, biochemistry

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.360
and then make them medical doctors, yeah?

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.680
Yeah, so it's related, yeah?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.160
So you have to understand the

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.080
principles of biochemistry and so

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.920
in order to understand human body and so on,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.560
but you need clinical experiences, yeah?

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.520
You should have actually looked

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.040
at actual patients

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.880
to know how to diagnose them as well.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.640
Yes, this is, this is the,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.560
the big thing that I feel is missing.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.680
And to be honest, it's why I was impressed

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.560
when I went to your lecture series.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.320
Which is, I think that from my personal

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.880
experience, first of all, these guys who study

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.760
economics to high level, they're smart guys.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.120
They're very good-

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.640
Of course, yeah.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.960
To be honest, they're very good at maths.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.360
Yeah.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.040
But I think there's really a lack of

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.920
being able to, or even in a sense thinking that it's

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.200
a thing you should do, step back and look at what

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.800
you're doing in a, in a sort of big picture sense.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.200
Yeah.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.000
I always remember when I was at Oxford, we had

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.080
one lecture, and there was a discussion

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.520
of like the aftermath to the 2008 crisis.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.720
Which the recovery was much weaker than everybody

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.120
predicted, and they were saying, "We don't know

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.480
why." And I put my hand up and I asked this guy-

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.960
"Okay, well, why do you think it was?"

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.160
And he said, and I think this is

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.400
one of the funniest things I've ever heard.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.920
He said, "We're not sure why, but we think it

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.880
was because of an exogenous shock to consumption

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.200
savings preferences." Which is, oh, this me,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.600
I have to explain this to the audience, right?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.520
Exogenous is a technical term in economics modeling

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.760
which means something outside of the model has changed.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.040
So I've asked him, "Why do you think..." You

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040
know, this is a real thing that happened in the

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.800
real world.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.560
"Why do you think the recovery was so weak?" And he

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.200
said, without like a hint of irony, "We think something

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.520
outside the model changed." And that is crazy.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.640
It's a cr- but I think it shows exactly when you

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.520
make a guy do so, do so much maths in the model

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.920
they forget that the model is not the real world.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.920
And when you reach the point that you start

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.480
explaining things in the real world by using

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.760
technical terms, saying something outside

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.080
the model has changed, I think this captures

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.680
like exactly what has gone wrong.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.800
And the maddest thing is, nobody

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.400
in the hall even laughs, you know?

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.360
They just think, they're just like, they...

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.560
I think this form of like very, very

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.360
intense forcing people to do maths

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.880
is almost like a brainwashing.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.200
That's right, yeah, yeah.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.600
No, I mean, first of all, you know, that

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.520
what this guy was implicitly saying was

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.440
"Suddenly people didn't want to spend."

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.000
Yeah, which is the whole answer, yeah.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.360
Why, yeah?

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.880
Yeah.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.680
Some I don't know, alien overlord that...

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.080
Yeah, came in and changed the world.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.480
Yeah.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.800
That's right, came and changed people.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.400
I mean, that's so stupid.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.480
But secondly, even if that is the case, then

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.600
why are you not putting that into your model, yeah?

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.680
Yeah, it's-

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.440
So it's that,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.840
like, you know, I mean, unfortunately, this

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.480
is now kind of verging on

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.640
becoming a theology, you know.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:32.840
I mean-

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.480
Yeah, yeah, I saw.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.320
I don't know if you realise.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.360
I know you're not on social media.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.320
There is a clip of you kind

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.800
of going viral on social media.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.080
Oh, yeah, yeah,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.840
Are you aware of this?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.560
Well, yeah, my son, who's...

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.120
who's working in the the Royal Institution.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.120
He's a biologist.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.520
But even he saw it.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.240
People keep sending it to me, yeah, of you

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.600
basically saying like... And I think it's a

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.000
really good point and I think it's totally true.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.240
Like it or not, economics has become a bit like

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.840
Catholic theology in medieval Europe.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.280
It has, basically become

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.920
the language of the rulers.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.160
So, if you don't speak economics, you

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.200
cannot participate in any debate.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.000
Unless you're able to speak in this language, use these

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.080
terms, you're basically not allowed to have an opinion.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.680
And it kind of locks... To be

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.280
honest, like, it locks poor people

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.680
out of the conversation.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.200
This... I mean, this scary parallel

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.960
with Catholic theology in medieval Europe

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.280
Yeah.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.680
So, theology at the time was justifying

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.200
whatever is going on in the world.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.800
Yeah?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:39.880
Yeah.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.600
You know, famine and exploitation.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.320
You know, the abuse of power.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.840
Whatever, it's all in God's will, yeah?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.600
Today, whatever is going wrong in

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.360
the world is justified by economics.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.000
Yeah, must be-

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.240
This must be what is best for the economy.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.000
Exactly, yeah.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.400
Yeah.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.280
Best of all possible worlds, yeah?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.680
And to make it worse-

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.120
they, they use that term a lot in economi-

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.600
well, they use, "The first best optimal."

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.960
Have you, have you read Candide by Voltaire?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.960
Yeah, so there's a book, it influenced

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.720
me a lot in my book, where he talks about-

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720
this, It's by Voltaire.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.040
Hundreds of years ago.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.720
He says that back in the day

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.000
they justified everything by saying,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.280
"If it wasn't supposed to be like this-"

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:23.720
That's right.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.960
"... God wouldn't have made it like this."

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.840
"This must be the best of all possible worlds or

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.600
God would've made it differently."

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.120
Yeah.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.240
And economics uses sometimes similar language.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.760
They say like, "The first best optimal outcome."

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.320
"If it wasn't supposed to be like this,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.600
the economy wouldn't have made this."

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:36.640
Absolutely.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.240
But what I want to... The point which I

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.240
make a lot on this channel is if you reach

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.400
high levels in this debate about how we should

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.720
run the economy, how we should manage the

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.640
economy, so if you become a prestigious academic

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.400
or if you become a high level politician, or if

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.960
you become, working in the central bank, or

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.800
even high level media, you're quite rich by that point.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.280
Yeah.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.240
And then what you have is a group of rich people

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240
basically refusing to allow poor people

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.360
into the conversation because they're

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.080
saying, "Sorry, you can't speak the maths,"

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.160
saying, "We think nothing should change"

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.680
as a way of justifying a system which, from where I'm

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.840
standing, appears to make the rich richer every year.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.360
Yeah.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.840
And is, is... It's crushing living standards.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.360
Yeah, we have to remember, you know, during

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.120
the, the medieval times, the Vatican

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.320
did not allow the Bible to be translated

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.000
into vernacular languages.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.920
It all had to be in Latin.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.640
So most people couldn't read Latin.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.120
And therefore, they had to just take

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.840
the priest's word for... I mean, the...

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.400
Yeah, the face value, yeah?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.320
This is basically why the Daily

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.920
Mail has run four stories on me

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.960
in four consecutive days, because...

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.640
You are dangerous.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.440
What I'm trying to do on this channel, and I think

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.240
it's also a lot of what you're trying to do,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.160
in the work that you do, but also your books,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.120
which are very accessible to ordinary people

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.320
is, you're trying to explain what's happening to

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.360
ordinary people in a language they can understand.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.080
And well, I talk about it a lot on

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.400
this channel, what I think is happening

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.920
is that the distribution is changing.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.760
The wealth distribution is changing in front of us.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.040
Ordinary people are getting poorer.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.640
The rich and the very rich are getting richer.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.320
And I think if people... You know,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.200
I said it a lot on this channel,

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.040
what I see my mission as is really quite simply

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.880
getting people to understand what is happening.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.680
Absolutely, yeah.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.400
Because if people understood what is happening and also

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.400
what's goIng to happen, so in my opinion, and don't

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.640
know how much of our videos you've watched, I think

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.800
this crisis of wealth inequality will get worse.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.840
I think it's, it's really going to...

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.960
It's already decimated the working classes

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.920
in the West.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.040
I think it's starting to decimate the middle class.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.920
You're seeing how it's basically impoverishing

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.080
the government, and that is happening in a

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.800
context of rapidly growing wealth of the richest.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.200
Yeah, and now, I mean, in places like the US,

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.440
although it's happening in other countries

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.840
at a lower level, you know, now

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.560
there's blatant money politics, yeah?

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.400
Yeah.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.040
Well, I saw on the news this morning- we had

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.800
Elon Musk offering people a million dollars-

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.000
Exactly,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.240
if you voted his way.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:11.720
Yeah.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.320
Well, this is another point I like to make

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.440
a lot, which is, distribution of wealth is

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.720
distribution of power and, it's control over

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.480
resources, but it's also control over the media

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.280
and it's also control over the politicians.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:24.760
Exactly.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.160
Now, we're in a downward spiral

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.040
because it's feeding into each other.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.880
So, the more inequality, economic inequality

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.360
gives more power to this rich people

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:35.560
Yeah.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.560
Which they can then use to take more power.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:37.960
Yeah, that's right.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.800
I talk about this a lot actually.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.560
I talk about basically these dynamics

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.360
which you're talking about, which is

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.440
the more power they have, the more they can...

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.040
The quicker they can take the rest of the power-

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.560
which means they will then have more power.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.480
And I think that this is the kind of

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.880
spiral that, that we are in, and

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.080
yeah, I'll be honest, I speak about it a lot.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.440
I'm really worried about where this goes.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.440
Like, on the first level in terms of living standards,

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.840
but also in terms of, in terms of politics, because...

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.000
Well, first, I suppose, I'll ask you this question.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.920
I think, unfortunately, that unless we get some

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.360
change on taxation inequality, which I don't

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.880
think we will get, at least in the short term,

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.760
I think living standards in... for

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.040
the West, for the working class, for the

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.120
middle class, will continue to decrease.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.040
Do you think that's likely?

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.160
You have so-called Labour Government

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.200
cutting benefits, yeah?

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.240
Yeah.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.280
Disability benefits of all things, yeah.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.760
I think unless... I know, you know, I'm trying

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.800
to get some influence with, with the Labour Party

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.160
obviously the government of this country. Why do you

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.520
think they're so reluctant to discuss taxing the riches?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.960
Well, I mean, a a kind of

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.760
charitable interpretation is that

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.000
they are scared of the financial market, yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.960
Yeah, but you know...

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.760
Yeah, but I think-

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.960
If you borrow a lot, so I think at the moment

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.320
we're in this space where they, they want

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.800
to borrow, it's just borrow, borrow, borrow.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.040
But if you borrow from the financial markets,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.080
you know, you are essentially borrowing from the rich.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:11.360
Yeah.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.120
If borrowing is your only plan

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.160
then you are a slave to the financial markets.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.560
You know, if I... if my plan is to borrow from you,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.000
then I need you to agree to that.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.240
If my plan is to tax you, I

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240
don't need you to agree to that.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.880
So I think really the way to break out

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.400
of that fear of financial markets is to start

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.920
talking about, about taxation and, and...

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.080
well, I'll tell you what I think.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.640
You didn't ask, but I'll tell you what I think.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.760
I think these guys, they're being

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.080
pressured by their rich funders.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.960
I think they don't want to push back on it basically.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.480
But I think also, I think there is a real lack of

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.480
economists in looking at things like the distribution.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.480
Yeah, so unfortunately I think that

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.200
economists in the Labour Party, they

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.880
are still living in this mental cage

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.000
built by Margaret Thatcher, yeah?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.840
Yeah.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.320
So the high taxation for the rich is bad, you

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.280
know, the private ownership of everything is

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.720
good, that kind of... I mean, unfortunately,

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.760
I'm sure that they are uncomfortable with it, but

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.520
they haven't been able to develop

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.520
a counter-narrative, yeah?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.560
No, let's look at some facts.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.360
You know, in the 1960s and '70s, Britain was one

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.320
of the most equal countries in the world, you know?

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.680
People don't often realise it.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.280
The country was growing faster than

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.120
what it is... has been growing

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.280
in the last 30 years,

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.400
despite having, you know, top

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.400
income tax rate of 80%, yeah?

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.600
Yeah.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.720
In the US at the time, the top income

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.280
tax rate was even higher, 90%, yeah?

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.760
But it was growing much faster

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.840
than what it is doing today, you know?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.400
At least try to use those historical

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.120
facts to develop some counter-narrative, you know?

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.880
But since they haven't developed this

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.920
counter-narrative and basically given up on

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.040
the taxing the rich taxing wealth and so on

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.760
what do they do?

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.640
There's only one

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.200
way to spend more which is

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.040
borrowing which that creates

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.600
the problem that you just talked about.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.160
Yeah, I th- I think it's, I think it's kind of

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.720
the same thing which I said before, which is like

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.760
a bit of an inability, and I think maybe we kind

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.360
of teach this a little bit in the way that we...

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.440
the way that we educate people in university now. An

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.040
inability to step back and look at the big picture.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.280
And the big thing which I often talk about

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.400
was, you know, and the reason I started

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.080
my channel was at the beginning of COVID,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.360
it was very clear that the UK government and the

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.280
US government and basically all Western governments

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.880
were going to give a huge amount of money out.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.040
And the UK deficit as I said is £1 trillion, and all

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.880
wanted to know, because my background is distribution

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.800
inequality, who is going to get that £1 trillion?

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.640
That's the only thing I wanted to know.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.560
Because you know, the US number is, I

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.480
think, $13 trillion, you know, huge numbers,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.120
you're obviously going to change the distribution

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.160
here, you're obviously going to change the distribution

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.400
but I think it was so amazing, just nobody asked.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.600
Nobody, and I think we've... I think personally,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.280
it goes back, I honestly think it goes back to

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.240
the way that we teach our economic students.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.520
This way that we just whip them into do the maths,

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.520
do the maths, do the maths, don't question the model,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.440
don't think about the big picture, and then you

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.240
reach a point where, you know, we can give out £1

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.360
trillion, the Americans can give out $13 trillion,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.640
and because our models never question distribution,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.200
nobody even asks where it's going to end up.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.960
I think it's, I think it's amazing.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.280
Well this extra money was basically

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.400
given to banks and other financial institutions,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.280
which they refused to give it to productive

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.160
enterprises that need this money for investment,

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.240
to give to ordinary consumers...

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.080
sorry, ordinary citizens, yeah?

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.240
Yeah.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.080
I mean, why couldn't they do it with

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.680
more kind of taxation

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.240
you know I mean?

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.880
Okay, I mean if you think generally high level

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.240
of taxation is not a good thing, at least

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.720
you can, have emergency taxations, yeah?

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.560
A lot of countries did that, yeah?

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.440
During wartime and in the post-war

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.400
reconstruction, they would kind of,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.600
occasionally impose a special levy

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.280
of whatever percent on the rich

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.240
people for five years or whatever.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.320
Yeah.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.440
Yeah, I think it's interesting you mention

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.000
wartime periods, because, you know, we've... So the

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.120
channel has really been growing and it's becoming

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.760
really popular, and you know, this... this argument of

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.920
why are you not taxing the rich is growing and growing

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.200
and growing and growing. And I think we actually

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.000
made some good progress, because for a long time we

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.400
would get this kind of economic pushbacks, it's not

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.040
good for the economy, it's not good for the economy.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.200
There's no evidence for that.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.760
No, there's not

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.880
and, but increasingly people are not believing that

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.360
but the argument against has kind of shifted

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.000
to this like, well, it's not possible

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.360
you can't tax rich people

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.800
and this kind of fatalistic,

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800
well, things always get worse

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.600
you can't do anything.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.280
But then if you look back at especially the

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.800
Second World War in Europe, in the West,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.720
there was a massive decrease in wealth inequality.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.200
Oh, absolutely.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.520
So it's obviously, it's obviously doable.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.520
Why... I don't know, have you got anything you

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.680
can say about whether it's possible, and also

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.040
why so many people are so quick to say it's

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.640
impossible when we have this historical example?

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.320
I think one reason why it is more

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.000
difficult than before is that downward

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.120
spiral that we have talked about, yeah?

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.120
Increasing inequality feeding into

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.040
increasing inequality of power

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.520
and democracy being more

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.600
and more constrained.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:00.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.640
So, that's one reason why I think

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.720
it is more difficult to do that now than

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.000
Yeah.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.920
it was possible in the 1950s or '60s.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.040
I think this is a really good point because I

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.280
think people push back and they say it's impossible

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.480
because you can't do it technically, but the

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.520
Second World War proves it's technically possible.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.720
The truth is, what makes it very, very difficult,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.480
in my opinion, is that control of the media

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.800
and the control of politicians because

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.960
whenever I go on TV or radio

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.760
to campaign for wealth taxes,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.520
I'm always doing it for free

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.360
and I'm self-funded.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.760
And I'm up against somebody who works for a think tank

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.200
funded by billionaires.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.600
And sometimes people... if you wonder why

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.240
there's not more voices like me in the media

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.360
because who funds it?

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.680
The billionaires are actively

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.480
paying for people to go on TV

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.880
go on the radio and say it's impossible to tax the rich.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.320
Who is paying

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.320
for people like me to make the counterargument?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.160
You know, basically nobody.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160
So that shows you

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.000
really, the way they block it

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.640
is by fighting that narrative battle.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.320
And winning that narrative

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.040
Yeah, exactly, yeah, but there you have,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.120
Nelson Mandela once said, "It always

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.680
looks impossible until it is done," yeah?

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.000
Yeah.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.440
We can do it, we have to do it.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.160
We have to start somewhere, yeah?

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:19.360
I mean,

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.240
okay, I mean change the narrative,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.840
maybe put more pressure on your

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.000
politicians, yeah, and do more

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.400
mass economic literacy campaigns so that

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.520
more people know about these things like

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.480
you are doing in a very, very effective way.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.120
I mean, we have to change this, yeah?

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.600
Yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.600
And it can be done.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.560
Okay, maybe the 90% is too much, yeah?

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.480
But why should it be 40% or 50%?

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.400
It could be the 60%, 70%, yeah?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.440
And I always talk about how it's not even

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.280
necessarily just about what rates we tax income.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.040
You know, we have these very, very wealthy families-

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.560
That's right, we have-

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.600
they don't pay income tax.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.240
tax wealth, yeah.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.400
Yeah, I think this is the big thing.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.840
They don't have income in the-

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.760
Yeah, their

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.160
income is not classed as income.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.480
Exactly.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.280
But, you know, they do receive billions

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.440
of pounds in their lifetime.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.680
I think... I think often what is, what is often done

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.640
is when I say want to tax the rich, my opponents try

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.040
to convince the public that means you, that means you.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.560
And they, they try to ignore, you know,

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.000
there are families out there with hundreds

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.520
of millions, billions of pounds of wealth.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.720
Their wealth is growing and growing and growing

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.880
and they're squeezing people out.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.000
Yeah.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.840
They're squeezing people out.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.920
This is the worry I have.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.960
But, I think... I look at

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.000
the growth of this narrative

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.000
the massive growth and support for it.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.320
I think we can win the public battle for it, but

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.040
I think we need more support from economists.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.800
Which is why I'm always glad to hear

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.040
you're doing the work you're doing.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.280
And I'm hoping we get more young people going

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.480
into economics to push this... push this narrative.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.320
I think that, I think that's really good.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.240
I guess I would like to end on just asking you,

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.160
I can often be a little bit pessimistic and a

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.560
little bit depressing, but I do this work

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.600
because I think we can make things better.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.560
So at these times when living standards

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.720
are falling and we have increased political

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.000
turbulence, what is it that gives you hope for our

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.960
future as a society and our future as an economy?

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.560
Yeah, well, I, yeah, you know, try to live

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.280
by the dictum of the Italian Marxist

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.360
philosopher Antonio Gramsci who said

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.400
that we need the pessimism of the intellect,

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.840
but optimism of the will, yeah?

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.720
Yeah, so you have to be realistic about

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.040
what can be achieved at the moment.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.480
Yeah.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.640
You know, so that makes you pessimistic because

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.280
debts kind of stack so much against

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.920
the ordinary people, but in the long run, you

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.920
know, the world has changed hugely, yeah?

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.200
If changes weren't impossible

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.040
you know, we'd be still living in a

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.200
society with slaves and most people are

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.160
you know, tied to their land and do not have

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.760
any freedom to choose their profession.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.200
You know, the women will not

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.440
be allowed to vote, you know.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.880
There'll be explicit

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.840
racial discrimination.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.560
But these things all have changed

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.800
because people have fought for it, yeah?

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.760
So if you take the perspective

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.680
of 50 years, 100 years, yeah?

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.400
We can change this, you know.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.600
I think that's the key thing is

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.760
because people fought for it.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:36.960
Yeah.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.080
Because people fought for it.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.160
Exactly.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.000
I think we can.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.760
I'm fighting for it.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.920
I know you're doing your bit.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.280
Yeah, thank you very much.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.440
Thanks for coming on the channel.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.000
That's great for me.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.280
Is there anything you wanted to, you wanted to

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.240
bring up or anything you want to speak about?

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:52.760
I mean, I'm very honored to be the first

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.080
outside speaker in your great series.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.200
Yeah, I mean, please get other

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.800
speakers so that you can diversify

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.120
your... I mean, what you are doing

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.240
is great, but, you know, we need

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.920
kind of different people coming in too.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.080
Yeah, I think we need-

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.080
Give, different perspectives.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.520
it's important for us to have more economists, I think.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.560
Because this channel is like, it's getting so

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.920
popular with the public, but, you know, we have

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.200
all of these rich posh guys, "Oh, no, I never work.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.640
Oh, no, I never work." And, you know, we live in a

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.160
very class-focused society. And, I think... I'm

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160
from a working-class background, and think one of

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.480
the reasons why the channel is popular is because

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.840
the country's from a working-class background.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.600
They're happy to hear that.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.320
But the fact is, the guys who

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.320
control the levers of power

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.200
they're normally not from working-class backgrounds.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.000
Yeah, but there are some kind of

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.160
good economists working on these issues.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.760
You know, get Piketty or Zucman, yeah?

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.000
Yeah, you know, I think we'll reach out.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.520
We'll reach out.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.720
I think Piketty and Zucman are great.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.360
They're French economists working in inequality.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.680
But yeah, thank you very much for coming on.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.920
Ha-Joon has not asked me to, to recommend his books,

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.880
but, I think Ha-Joon has a lot of books out.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.400
His recent one is Edible Economics,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.480
which is here on the table.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.520
He didn't ask me to do this, honestly he didn't.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.840
I think Ha-Joon writes really well economics in a

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.280
way that is enjoyable and relatable to ordinary people.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.800
So, if you're watching and you find economics

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.520
inaccessible, and you want... I obviously

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.440
haven't written any books about economics,

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.040
like straight books about economics, but

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.360
I think Ha-Joon's books are really good.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.600
And if you've got questions for Ha-Joon, send

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.400
them in and maybe we'll get him on again someday.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.400
But, yeah, basically, thank you very much-

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:29.800
Thank you.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.280
for coming on.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.000
I really enjoyed this time.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.240
Great.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.360
And, yeah, good to see you again.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.600
Thank you very much.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.400
And thank you very much for your support.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.720
Keep watching, share the videos

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.080
with your friends, with your mum.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.600
It's all about stopping the economy from getting worse.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.520
It's about taxing wealth and not work.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.760
Support us.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.640
Thank you very much.
