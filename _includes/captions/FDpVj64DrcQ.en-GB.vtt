00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.400
Today, we are going to explain how you lose your house.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.480
Alright, I wanted to do a video that explains very explicitly

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.640
how you lose your house.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.320
Because we exist in a country

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.560
and in the world, in fact, of rapidly growing wealth inequality.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.200
And yet when I talk about this,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
we often see a number of people saying, well,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.960
you know, I own my own property.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.640
You know, I'm going to pass my property on to my kids,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm going to get my property from my parents.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.880
So I don't want tax to be raised because, you know, we're okay.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.600
We've got property we're going to protect that.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
The reality of the situation is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.240
that ordinary families are getting poorer.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080
They losing their wealth.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.520
So I want to explain explicitly how that is happening.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.040
So I think the first thing to say is a big part of this

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.200
dynamic is basically about two different

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.160
mentalities and attitudes towards wealth building

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.760
that differ across generations.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.520
So my parents generation,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.400
my parents are born in the late fifties, early sixties.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.600
They were part of a generation

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.720
which was unusually able to buy property

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.160
with the money they made from working.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.520
Back in those periods of time,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.960
the average property was only sort of two

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.800
or three times income in many places.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.960
Interest rates were high,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.800
you could save up money, build some interest,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.480
buy property relatively easily.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.040
So these people lived in a world

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.640
where if you were willing to, sort of,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.800
work hard and save up, you could buy property.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.120
The world has changed a lot since then

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.360
and younger people nowadays live in a world where it's increasingly

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.440
almost impossible to buy property without a big inheritance

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.320
from your parents.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360
So what this means is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.120
there's a kind of a disconnect

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.240
in understanding between generations here.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.160
Which is the older generation, which still owns,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.360
in many cases, a decent chunk of wealth in terms of housing.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680
They think that the younger generation

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.040
will be able to buy their own homes,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.400
but that is effectively impossible.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600
So what that means is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.240
the older generation is thinking, well,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
I'm going to use this money to,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.240
you know, basically pay for my my end of life care,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.200
hoping that,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.520
you know,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.760
and their retirements, hoping that the younger generation

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.200
will be able to buy properties on the back of their own work

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.920
which is impossible.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.400
So what you then have is the older generation

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.000
releasing the equity in their homes,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.120
selling their homes, using equity release schemes

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.840
in order to pay

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.920
for their retirements, pay for their end of life care,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.640
thinking that their kids will be alright

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.080
because they can buy their own homes and then the kids

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.240
can't buy their own homes essentially.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.400
And the kids are left in a situation

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.240
where the only way to buy a home

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.040
is to take out a really enormous mortgage

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.680
or basically to rent for their whole lives.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
So I should add, you know, my grandparents,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.080
all of them own their own property,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.560
and they've all passed away now,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.080
and none of them were able

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.760
to pass significant amounts of equity down

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.720
because that money was basically

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.320
all used to pay for their end of life care.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.160
Increasingly, elderly people are living into their nineties.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240
They have to pay for end of life care for a long period of time.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.760
It's very expensive

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.560
and this is essentially the way in

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.760
which ordinary people are losing their houses.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.800
But, the question I always ask is, you know,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.120
the amount of housing is not decreasing.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.600
The amount of debt adds up to zero.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.360
So if ordinary families are owning less homes,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.520
using more debt,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.400
that can only mean that the rich are owning more homes

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.360
and having increasingly large amounts of money owed to them.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.080
So in a sense,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.600
the lack of home ownership

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.640
and the increased indebtedness of ordinary families

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.880
is a manifestation is in fact the exact mirror

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.360
image of this rapidly growing wealth of the very rich,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.680
of the very rich that I talk about.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.000
So, you know,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.400
I think maybe people sometimes think I'm just sort of hate

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.040
rich people.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.240
I am a rich person. I don't hate rich people.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.200
But if you are allowing the wealth of the rich to grow enormously

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.440
at a time when the economy is not growing,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720
the only way that that can happen

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.840
is that the wealth of the middle classes

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080
is being moved over to the rich.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.480
And that can only happen if ordinary people are losing their homes.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.080
And, you know,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.840
I wanted to connect this to, we’ve

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.000
been speaking a little bit about tax in some of our shorts.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.920
The reality of the situation is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920
most ordinary families

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.680
are going to lose a significant chunks of their

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.720
property wealth in order to pay for end of life care.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.000
And through that mechanism, ordinary families will become poorer.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.280
They'll lose their assets.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.040
You know, one alternative to this would be to tax very rich people

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.720
who are seeing the biggest

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.200
and fastest

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.280
ever increases in their wealth in history,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.640
tax them more to pay for a government funded care service.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.480
And then in that case,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.200
your dad, your grandad, you know,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.720
you yourself, when you’re old wouldn’t

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.000
need to sell your home

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.240
in order to be able to live a dignified life in old age.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.040
So I think people often instinctively think we need to reduce tax

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.320
to protect my wealth.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.640
But we do have an alternative,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.920
which is tax the people who are increasingly

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.640
going to own your wealth to pay for the things that you need.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.920
I think we need to address the reality of the situation here,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.640
which is

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.000
ordinary families are losing their wealth.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.640
Rich people are gaining it.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.640
And tax can be used

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.440
as a defense, as an alternative, basically, you know.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.600
If we tax the wealth back

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.520
from the people who are taking your wealth,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.200
we can use that to give you the things you need,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.360
which you will otherwise have to sell your home to afford.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.640
You know, I talk about a lot on this channel.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.680
It's very important to understand the flows of wealth, understand

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.280
which groups are getting richer,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.840
which groups are getting poorer

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.640
at the moment is ordinary families

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.120
who over

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.480
the generations are getting poorer, generation after generation,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.440
going further into debt and in fewer houses

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.720
and having lower standards of living.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800
That wealth is going to the rich.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.240
The only way to reverse that is to tax the rich more.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.920
We're going to campaign for more on this channel.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.520
Tell your friends, tell your family, send the video to your mum,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.600
and hopefully we can make a change. Thank you.
