00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.920
Okay, welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.680
Today's video is going to be about mental health.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.960
Okay, so when I decide to do these videos, I've

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.120
got a really long Google Doc which has a list of all

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.680
the subjects that I want to do a video about, and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.280
I've had one on that list about mental health and the

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.480
relationship between mental health and the economy,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.040
and economy and mental health for a long, long time.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.560
And one of my friends is always

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560
telling me I need to make that video, but

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.880
I've put it off for a long time.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
Largely because, firstly, I don't like to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.160
do videos on subjects that are not directly

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.080
related to the economy, and I like to try and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.160
stay in my lane and be super economy-focused.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.080
And secondly, because, it felt a little bit,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.800
perhaps a bit personal, a bit indulgent.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.240
Anyone who's read my book will know that I've

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.120
had problems with mental health in the past, and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840
perhaps I was a little bit unwilling to be one

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.560
of those typical guys on YouTube that starts talking

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.320
about his own mental health in his videos.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.480
But I've decided to do it this week for a couple of reasons.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.600
The first one is, the last few months

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.240
since I got back from being away,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120
I've been doing a lot of videos about

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.040
explaining why we need wealth taxes, how can you

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.240
convince your friends that we need wealth taxes.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.400
And obviously, really, this whole channel is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.600
me trying to persuade you and, me trying to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800
persuade the public that we need wealth taxes.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.080
And the longer I've been doing that, especially

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.520
the last couple of weeks, where you put out

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.320
your arguments for wealth taxes and you see

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.440
people coming back with their arguments

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.200
why we shouldn't,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.440
the more I start to feel that in a way

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.800
we're not really arguing about the economy at all.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.280
I think we're putting out this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.200
idea into the world, there's massive

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.640
economic problems, we need to fix things.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.760
And, often what we get back I

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.920
think is kind of an emotional response.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.360
And I think the emotional response we get back

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480
when we send this message, "The economy is collapsing,"

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.880
is a pretty understandable emotional response, which

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.320
is that people are scared and people are worried, and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.640
they don't want the situation to be what I'm saying

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.400
it is, which is that the situation is really bad.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.320
It's getting worse.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.360
The way to deal with it is to work together

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.040
to fight against the richest and most powerful

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280
people in society, because that's scary.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.520
And I think really, a lot of what I've been

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.200
doing the last few months, these few years, trying to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.200
convince people we need wealth taxes in the economy,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.440
a lot of the problem we are having is actually about

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.200
mental health and people who are scared

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.480
about what's happening in the economy.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.920
And people who, because they are scared, are

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.720
looking for simple solutions and are

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.080
unwilling to engage with what we are saying.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.280
So wanted talk bit about that.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.080
I wanted to talk about my relationship with that,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.280
because this is something that I went through

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.640
when I first realised these things were happening.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.160
The second reason why I wanted to do it is because

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.440
I myself have been having a little bit of a difficult

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.400
time, especially the last, say, month or so, mental

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
health-wise, motivation-wise, and I thought that meant

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.760
it was a good time to talk about mental health, what

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680
it means to the economy, what it means for this

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080
channel, and what it means about how we fix things.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
And thirdly, I've been re-reading one of my

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.040
favorite books recently, which is this book here.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.760
Not being paid by Camus.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.480
He's dead.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.720
This is, The Plague by Albert Camus.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.800
Camus is a French-Algerian author who wrote

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.280
this really beautiful book about what it means to live

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.160
in a collapsing society and what that,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.600
what that does to us and our mental health.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.600
So yeah, we're going to talk about mental health

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.280
today and how that affects the economy.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.840
All right, so the first point I want to make, which

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.240
is that the crisis of mental health which we're

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.600
living in, in this country, in the US, across

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760
the world, and the crisis of the economy are super

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.680
related in a way that should be really, really

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.360
obvious, but for some reason is often ignored.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.680
So I went on Question Time this year,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.480
I think it was maybe in March, and

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.200
the subject of mental health came up.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.360
There's lots of statistics showing

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.520
that, especially for young people, like

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.960
mental health is really deteriorating.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.920
Lots of people are stressed.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.080
Lots of people are depressed.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.240
And we were asked, the panel, you know, "Why do you

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.200
think people are stressed and depressed?" And,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.760
one of the ladies on the panel said she thinks it's

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.760
because of mobile phones and social media.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.600
And you know, perhaps that is a part to

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.640
play in it, but it was very frustrating for

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.720
me because we live here in a society where

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.800
it is increasingly impossible to do like simple things

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.920
like buy a house and have security for a family,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.920
be able to get like a decent living environment.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.480
To get that you need work all the hours God sends.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.600
You need to get a really competitive degree, and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.200
I think it should be really, really obvious that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.240
a big part of the reason why people, especially

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.800
young people, are having mental health problems,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.080
is because it's increasingly impossible just be

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320
able to afford the basics of life for most people.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.760
So I think we'll put up a little clip of me

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.320
trying to convince the people on Question Time

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.040
that mental health is, is not just because

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.600
of phones and it's not just because of individual

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.360
problems, but is related to societal problems.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.080
I think we need to talk about the unbelievably

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.840
hostile circumstances young people face

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.880
with regards to their economic futures.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.040
More and more and more young

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.200
people growing up in poverty.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.560
But even aside from that, we've got

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.800
people with jobs in London who are homeless.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.120
So that means if you're a young person, you

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840
know that even if you get an ordinary job,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.760
it's not going to be enough to buy a home.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.480
It's not going to be enough to have a family.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.320
So, so just doing the right thing,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.720
working and getting job is, it doesn't

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.320
even guarantee you can feed your kids.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.360
You know, we have to look at this and then

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.560
obviously, if you're a young person, you're

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.840
thinking, "Well, if I don't get the best grades

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.080
and I don't get into the best university, then

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.120
I'm not even going to be able to have a family."

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.480
You know, what kind of world have we made here?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.000
You know, we need to look at it...

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360
We always look at the individual.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.400
This person has a mental health problem.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.680
This person has a mental health problem.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.040
It doesn't come out of nowhere.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.920
These people don't just suddenly get sick.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.160
My dad worked for the post office and he had a

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.520
family and he bought a house and he has a retirement.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.000
He has a pension.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320
Kids can't get that.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.200
Kids can't get that.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.640
Unless they make millions of pounds,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.800
they can't even have a family.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.240
It's ridiculous, you know.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.280
It's not just a problem for

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.240
individuals, it's a societal problem.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.480
We need make sure young people have economic

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.880
opportunity. It's super, super, super

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.280
frustrating when people treat mental health

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.880
problems as if they're like a broken leg.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.960
Like, you ****** up, you jumped

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.280
off a building, you broke your leg.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.760
Now you have a problem.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.400
These things are to do with society.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.960
If you create a society where people have security,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.760
where people can get good quality secure work, and

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.000
that secure work will be able to provide them with

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.480
the basics they need to support a family and to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.400
support a family with dignity, then a lot of people

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.320
will be relatively happy and calm and relaxed.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.560
If you create society like we live in now... I live

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.720
in a city where people work full-time jobs and are

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.960
homeless because they can't afford to pay rent, you

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.240
know, nevermind being able to do things like support

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160
a family with dignity, get financial security.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.520
People will feel insecure because

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.680
they genuinely are insecure.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.320
And I think it's really, really important

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.240
that we start viewing mental health problems,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.480
especially when they exist in societies where

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.360
the economic conditions are deteriorating

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.560
really quickly, as being related to the economy.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.160
So, mental health and

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.560
the economy are not unrelated.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.600
If you create an economy where people can live well,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.760
a lot of people will feel secure because they are secure.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.160
If you create an economy where it's very,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.360
very difficult to get security, people will

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.160
feel insecure because they will be insecure.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And this relates very much to my own

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.200
personal story and, the story of my book.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.920
So, some of you might not have read

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.040
my book so, or know my personal story.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.280
So I made most of my money in 2011 by betting that

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.560
basically the... the economic crisis would last forever.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.200
That was just after the 2008 crisis.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.600
And what I bet on was that the economy and

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.880
living standards for ordinary people would get

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.560
worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.200
And I bet on that again,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.480
at the beginning of COVID 2020.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.800
So I'm somebody who has been very aware for a

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.560
long time that living standards were going to fall.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.760
And a big part of the story of my book,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.400
especially the last section of my book,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.440
is very explicitly about

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.000
depression and mental health.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.400
And that was me sort of trying to deal with

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.040
this recent awareness that I had at

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.160
a very young age, in 2011 I was 24, that living

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.760
standards were going to get worse forever and

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.560
that, there would be big explosions in poverty in

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.680
my country, in your country, in the Western world.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.440
And you'd get people who'd read the book

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.000
asking me, you know, "So, how did you make your

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.480
money?" "Oh, I made my money betting society would

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.400
collapse." And then they'd say, "But how did you fall

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.440
into depression when you made so much money?" And I

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.480
think it would be like super interesting really that,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.760
that so many people sort of failed to recognise

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.400
that, knowing that the society you're in is

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.680
collapsing and is going to collapse would have

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.440
an effect on an individual's mental health.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.080
The, the little quote at

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.120
the front of the book, I've got couple.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.280
One of them is from the Japanese film director, Akira

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.000
Kurosawa, saying, "In mad world, only the mad are

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.200
sane." and this is basically about the...

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.160
What I wanted in this was to point out the fact

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.800
that the book is partially about me going mad, but

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760
is it a mad thing to do, to go mad when you know

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.920
you're in a society that is about to collapse?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.520
Yeah, that's really what I wanted to talk

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.600
about in this video because I think it's

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.080
super relevant to our work, trying to persuade

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.760
people they need to take action on inequality.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.160
This question of what does it do to the individual when

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.680
they realise they are in a society that is collapsing?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.440
The way that this crisis is often represented

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.720
in the media or from politicians is kind of as what

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.160
we call a recession, which means a couple of bad years.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.440
One bad year, two bad years, maybe if you're

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.320
really unlucky, three bad years, and then

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.840
things will start getting better again.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.200
But the reality is unless you're in the top 10%,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.120
really this just gets worse and worse

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.920
and worse and worse and worse for you.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.600
So, my plan was like, well, listen, this is like

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.680
really big political opportunity because the

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.160
political status quo works really, really badly

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.040
for like 90% of the population, and that means

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.960
we have a really good chance here to unite 90% of

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.880
the population to push for something different.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.640
Like in a democracy, if you have a status quo,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.760
which is going to impoverish the kids and grandkids

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.240
of 90% of the population, all you need to do is

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.760
show them the truth that this is going to happen,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.720
and you'll be able to motivate them to demand

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.480
something different from their politicians.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.520
And I think the problem with that plan

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.560
is really a problem of mental health.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.200
And I'll explain why.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.560
So this concept that what we were actually in

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.080
economically was a structural crisis of growing

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.320
inequality, that the bottom 90% was having their

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.240
wealth kind of aggressively out by the

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.440
top 1%, that is something that I realised in 2011

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.800
when I was working as a trader.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.600
At the time, my job was basically to predict

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.600
and bet on the future strength of like nations.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.680
So the UK, the US, Europe, these kinds of things.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.320
And it's a funny job in a way because

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.840
if you think that the economy is going to be really

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.840
bad and the economy turns out to be really bad,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.240
then you make money betting on terrible things.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.960
But that is your job, so it's this kind of strange

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.840
job which is slightly dehumanised in a way.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.280
Like if you think a bad thing's going to

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.720
happen, your job is to bet that bad thing is

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.160
going to happen, and you're kind of encouraged

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.960
to think abstractly, step outside the box.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.680
And, if you get it right, you make a

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.520
ton of money and nobody really questions like

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.120
whether it's the right or the wrong thing to do.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.360
And it felt like a very natural thing

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.240
to do for somebody who studied economics.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.520
So, I did economics undergrad at London School of

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.120
Economics, and then went into an economic analysis job.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.000
Your job is to look at economies, analyze economies,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.680
make predictions, bet on those predictions.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.880
So when I first put this bet on, I didn't really on

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.960
any conscious level think, "What does it mean to bet

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.720
on a collapsing economy?" Like I was a young person,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.960
this was my job, I was trying to make money.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.080
I put the bet on.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.480
And it wasn't really until the end of

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.440
the year... That year, so this was 2011.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.600
At the end of the year when I got paid on the year,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.560
that I started to really think about, "What does that

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.840
mean?" And to be honest, what you see in the sort of

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.720
latter part of my book is a long period of me having

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.080
this, what you might call, like cognitive dissonance,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.040
which is one part of my brain knows... Well, I

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.760
think the first thing say is, when you first put the

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.440
bet on, you don't know for sure that you're right.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.360
It's kind of, you're confident, you're confident enough

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.080
to bet on it, but you're not sure it's going to happen.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.440
Then at the end of 2011, I was Citibank's

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.240
most profitable trader in the year that year,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.760
based on betting society would collapse.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.320
And you get paid a ton of money.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.480
And I think that's probably where like part

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.760
of you starts thinking, "Is that like, okay?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.480
Like, should that be the way the world

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.840
works?" Like, should you just be paid

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.080
a ton of money if the world's going to collapse?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.200
Should you do anything about the economy collapsing?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.440
But I think this is really the big question,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.800
which was, you know, my plan is to show people the

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.800
economy is collapsing and hope they will take action.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.080
But when I myself realised the economy was

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.480
collapsing, it was a long time before I took action.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.520
And it started a sort of battle in myself where

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.360
first of all, you just kind of...

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.080
You don't want to accept it.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.760
You don't want to... Because I think if you

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.040
were to accept it, it would demand action from you.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.160
So for me as somebody who had made millions

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.560
of pounds betting on society collapsing,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.200
I think there's a pretty obvious moral case to

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200
make to somebody like that, that is like, "Well,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.160
maybe you should stop the economy from collapsing."

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.880
But obviously to do that, I would have had to quit

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.760
my job, and I was making an enormous amount of money.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.200
That would be scary.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.040
Like, I worked really, really hard to get that job.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.160
I came from a poor background, so walking away

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.240
from like such a well-paid job was a big thing.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.360
But also like, what do you do?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.680
Like, how can you actually stop this?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.800
And you have these arguments towards the latter

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.440
part of the book, where I'm sort of arguing with other

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.200
guys at Citibank, my colleagues saying, "Maybe we

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.480
should do something." There's one specific discussion

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480
with, a guy who in the book is called Arthur,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.800
where I say to him, like, "Do you think we should

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.040
do something about the collapsing economy?" And,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.760
he thinks I mean like, "Do you think we should put

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.520
a trade on?" He just keeps saying, "But you already

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.200
put the trade on." And I keep saying, "Should we

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.280
do something?" And he just doesn't understand it.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.520
And I think what you kind of see here

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.480
is basically when you confront somebody

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.000
who is working really hard, leads a stressful

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.800
life, has worked hard to get the job that they're

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.040
in, or is struggling to put food on the table,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.520
anybody, you say, "Hey, society is collapsing.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.200
Let's stop it," I think a very, very normal

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.480
emotional human response is to say like, "**** you.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
I'm busy.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.640
I'm stressed.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.640
Don't come and tell me we need

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.200
save the world, because not my job.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.680
That's the job of the politicians.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.960
Other people should be doing that." And I think a

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.640
lot of the pushback that we get, that I get

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.800
is basically from people who are kind of struggling

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.240
emotionally with the same thing I struggled

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.320
emotionally with for a long time, which was, "Oh, ****,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.480
the society we live in is collapsing.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.000
What the **** do we do?" And I think this kind of

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.040
debate which I had in my head or in my heart or

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.560
in my body sort of in 2011, 2012, and I didn't

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.840
finally quit that job till 2014, is to some degree

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.920
the argument that we're having in society now.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.880
Because it was pretty clear to me by 2012 that

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.280
what was going to happen was living standards would

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.880
keep falling basically forever until we stop them.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.400
But I don't think that became really obvious in wider

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.880
society, until maybe the last couple of years.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.000
I think you did start to see this

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.560
understanding grow more and more and more.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.240
I think that's part of the reason why Brexit happened.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.080
I think that's part of the reason why Trump

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.240
got elected both the first time and the second time.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.880
Now we're sort of moving into this space where

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.800
it becomes more and more obvious to everyone

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.840
that society is collapsing forever, the economy is

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:16.600
collapsing forever, and people as individuals need to

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.880
basically decide, "Okay, what do I do with that?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.160
How do I deal with that?" And

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.240
this is where Camus comes in.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.800
So I think this book, this book... Camus,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.520
a French Algerian author, he lived in France

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.440
during the Nazi occupation of France, and he saw

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.440
the rise of the Nazis in the mid-20th Century.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.480
And the book is about an epidemic

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.720
of plague in a city in Algeria.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.080
It's a metaphor for, for fascism and for

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.920
the Nazis and the growth of Nazism in Europe.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.800
But what he talks about is when you live

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.760
in the society that starts to collapse,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.920
what do people... how do people react

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.520
to that, and how should people react to that?

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.040
And in the book, what you see is, basically

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.440
most people just kind of freak the

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.160
**** out and kind of lose their minds.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.520
And I'm not going to criticise that response at all

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.160
because, that's basically what happened to me.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.360
I had basically a breakdown

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.880
when I realised society was collapsing.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.680
I realised it a long time before everybody else.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.080
I've had about 14 years to come to terms with it now.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.280
And you see some people become extremely religious.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.200
Some people become extremely angry.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.520
Some people become violent.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.000
Some people become greedy.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.560
A lot of people become hedonistic.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.320
And I think it's super, super

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.920
understandable, this is a reaction.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.200
And when I put my message out there into the

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.360
world on the videos saying, "Listen, if we

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.000
don't take action, society is going to collapse,"

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.600
a lot of the responses I get back

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.280
are basically... And, you know, people say, "Oh,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.160
the pro- but the actual solution is Bitcoin.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.120
What you actually need to do is to print money.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.360
You know, the problem is actually immigrants.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.440
The problem is actually foreigners." What

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.320
I really hear is a lot of people saying,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.520
"Listen, I'm ******* stressed enough as it is.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.720
Don't you dare tell me that this is my problem and

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.960
I need to fix it." The best example of that

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.520
was I gave a speech at like a really fancy,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.680
advertising company once, and I was on a panel.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.080
And I did this thing that I do where

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.360
I say, "Listen, actually we have this

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.640
fundamental problem with inequality.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.120
It's going to get worse and worse.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.600
If we don't take action, society will collapse."

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.320
And, um... a lady went up after me and

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.360
I think by all accounts, she's a very nice lady.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.320
And what she said was, "Listen, the economy

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.800
is part of God's plan and it's like nature.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.360
It's like the changing of the seasons.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.720
Sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.360
worse." And, this was very frustrating for

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.360
me in this room full of rich people because

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.440
if these people can persuade themselves

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.680
that inequality is part of God's plan,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.240
that sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.200
worse, that is a very, very good way of convincing

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.120
themselves that they don't need to take action.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.040
And I think a lot of what we are seeing at the

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.080
moment is people starting to realise their society

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.480
is collapsing and desperately trying to find a

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.080
story to tell themselves, "I'm going to be okay.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.200
I don't need to take action.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.960
I don't need to be responsible for fixing this."

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.640
So, the truth is, what we are selling here

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.160
on this channel is the truth, but it's not

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.360
the most promising choice, right?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.520
Because what we are saying is

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
we have a society-wide economic problem.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.200
The problem is being caused by the very rich.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.120
The people who are supposed be fixing it,

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.560
the politicians, the economists, are kind of

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.600
incompetent, kind of a little bit bought.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.000
They're not going to fix it.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.200
The job and the responsibility falls on you, ordinary

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.800
people, to unite together to educate one another

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.680
so that you can push back and fight against the

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.880
richest and most powerful people in society.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.200
I think we have to accept that especially in the

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.440
very individualistic societies we live in here in

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.480
the UK, US, that is not the most appealing message.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.280
And we're not the only guys selling a message

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.720
about, "How do you fix this?" There are a

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.160
lot of other messages online that's saying

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.680
there are other ways to fix your poverty.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.880
I'm going to show you one now from a Instagram

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.200
account I've been really enjoying lately.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.040
Listen to this.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.880
Slaves worked all the hours they were awake

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.000
for their entire lives.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.200
I think, like, if they can do it, so can I.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.440
You know, Aldous Huxley once said that a

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.400
really efficient totalitarian state would

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.120
be one with slaves who do not have to be

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.920
coerced because they love their servitude.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.520
The reason I wanted show you that is because

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.560
as we move further and further and further into this

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.000
collapsing economy, and more and more people lose

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.400
their minds, people are going to look for ways to get

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.680
out of this that they think can protect themselves.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.440
And I think one thing that is super

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.000
interesting about this is one of the other

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.360
big solutions that people being sold is if you

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.040
just work harder, if you work really, really,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.760
really, really, really, really hard, maybe you

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.920
will survive the collapse of your whole economy.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:10.160
And I think it's... it's really appealing

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.440
in this post-Thatcher/Reagan world.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.880
There was a quote which, Jack, my

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.280
cameraman, told me from Margaret Thatcher.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.040
She said, "Economics are the method.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.400
The object is to change the soul."

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.720
And I think that maybe 50 or 60 years ago, we might

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.080
have lived in countries where people understood

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.200
that the best way to protect your interests

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.720
from the rich is to work together.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.360
But as we've moved into very sort of individualistic

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.920
mindset, people have been increasingly convinced

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.600
that the best way to protect yourself from

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.120
the rich is to work really, really, really,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.800
really, really, really, really, really

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.480
hard and to compete with other poor people.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.040
If you do that, if everybody does that, if

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.120
everybody works really, really, really, really hard to

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.840
be the best and lowest paid and hardest working slave,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.600
all you will do is push wages down incredibly quickly

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.520
and impoverish yourself and everyone around you.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.120
The only way to fix this is

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.360
to find ways to work together.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.960
Okay, so what do you do if you're in that situation,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.640
if you're in a society that is collapsing?

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.560
The rich are taking everything.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.680
The 90% are being killed.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.640
The only real way to stop it is to try and unite

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.480
that 90% somehow, or as many of it as you can.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.040
But you live in this

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.840
phenomenally individualistic society.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.520
Okay, so I'll talk about what I did.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.320
And the truth is, you know, I kind of had

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.920
a mental breakdown basically, and this is

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.560
the story of the latter part of the book.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.520
I think it's quite beautifully written

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.720
personally, but you can read it if you're interested.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.960
And I tried really, really hard to

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.160
convince myself that this was not my problem.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.440
There's a side character in my book who,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.520
I wanted to include more, but I didn't have space.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.480
There's a guy called... In the book, he's called Hong.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.920
Really, really nice guy, maybe not the best trader.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.120
But he did this amazing thing, which

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.080
is he used to take like 30 sick days a year.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.920
And another guy who I used to work with

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.240
called Billy had a little book where

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.640
he used to record all of his sick days.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.640
That was on top of his 25 holiday days.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.600
And, nobody got really pissed about

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.840
this because he was such a nice guy, and,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.840
he had managed to do this thing in his work

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.960
where he had kind of emotionally detached himself

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.240
from his work, and he wasn't making the most

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.800
money as a trader, but he was a really nice guy.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.080
He was doing his job pretty well, and

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.640
he had managed to be emotionally detached.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.200
And I used to sit on my desk on Citibank

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.200
trading floor, and I used look at this guy.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.400
In the book, he's called Hong.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.400
This is the scene I wanted to include in the book.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.080
And I used to say to myself, "Why

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.440
can't you just be more like Hong?

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.240
Why can't you not give a **** about being the best

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.800
trader, not give a **** about the world collapsing?

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.240
Just get paid your half a million pound

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.960
a year and live a ******* good life."

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.240
And I tried and I tried and I tried for a long

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.760
time, to ignore this sort of, I guess, this

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.800
social responsibility to try and fix things.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.400
And then when I tried speak to traders

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.040
around me, you know, "Should we do things?"

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.720
They just sort of laughed, you know.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.880
Because obviously there's no... You can't pick

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.120
up the phone and speak to David Cameron and say,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.040
"The economy's collapsing." And they

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.680
said, "It's impossible to do anything." And,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.720
I told myself it was impossible to do anything.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.960
And the truth is, you know, I made this realisation

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.080
in 2011. I didn't quit 'til 2014.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.920
I tried really, really, really, really hard

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.040
to not do anything about the collapsing economy.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.640
But eventually, the truth is, my body kind

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.000
of made the decision for me, and, I got more

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.720
and more depressed, and I got more and more sick.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.040
And I didn't really get better until I chose to

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.160
quit that job and try and ******* do something.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.600
So personally, I think, and I think this is

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.040
the message that Camus comes across in his book,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.360
in a society that is collapsing,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.600
the only way to be healthy and to be calm is

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.560
to try to do something to stop that collapse.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.160
But the truth is, even when I did quit in

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.000
2014, I didn't work very aggressively, at

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.200
fixing the collapsing economy for a long time.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.400
This YouTube channel was started in 2020.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.960
So I haven't spoken much about the

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.760
period between me quitting my job in 2014

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.600
and me starting this YouTube channel in 2020.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.640
And people who read my book, I kind of wanted

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.160
give the impression that I never really wanted

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.400
to work for charity and it was kind of like

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.720
a game I was using get out of the bank.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.240
But the truth is, that whole period, 2014 - 2020,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.200
I was working in trying to find ways

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.920
to stop the economy from collapsing.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.920
And the first thing I did, which I think is

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.960
kind of the logical thing to do if your plan is

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.800
try and do something about growing inequality,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.360
is I went and I researched the political Left.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.800
It's a common, conspiracy that I'm some sort of

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.800
leftist, some massive leftist, some massive communist.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.920
But the truth is, I was never on the political

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.680
Left and, I never voted for Labour,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.800
at the point of leaving my job.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.640
But because I thought the problem

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.960
was inequality, I assumed the political

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.240
Left would be the right place to go.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.160
And I started research the political Left

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.440
and I volunteered at some think tanks.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.360
And, you know, I met some great people

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.960
who I do still talk to today.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.360
But I was actually like often very,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.800
very frustrated at, number one,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.080
there was almost nobody working on inequality.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.920
And number two, there were a lot of sort of very

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.200
posh, well-meaning people who didn't seem super, super,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.560
like really actively concerned and aggressive

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.000
about working really hard try and fix inequality.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.240
And I think this is another sort of mental health

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.520
wall you can hit when you try to fix things, which...

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.360
And we see this a lot, which is people watch our

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.280
videos, they become convinced like I was convinced,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.720
and they're like, "Oh my God, I want to do something.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.320
I want to help." But they, similarly to

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.840
me in that period of time, they don't know where

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.440
to go, they don't know where to use their energy,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.560
they don't know how to actually take action.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.240
So, this is a kind of next step from a mental health

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.520
perspective, which is you've realised what's

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.040
happening, you've had your freak-out, you've gone

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.560
mental for a bit, you've managed to calm yourself down.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.920
You're like, "Now I want to help," and

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.480
you can't actually find a place to help.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.160
So, I think with regards to this, I'm always...

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.480
We have this discussion quite a lot on

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.080
the channel, where we, we talk about like

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.960
should we get people to send letters to their

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.720
MPs or should we give them like calls to action?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.640
Should we arrange like a march?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.120
Should we arrange like rally?

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.200
And I've always been on the side of, I don't want to

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.320
arrange these kind of big grandstand events.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.120
What I want to... Because we're not...

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.440
I don't want people to give everything, get

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.720
super excited, and then burn themself out

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.680
because we haven't built those structures.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.000
So what I would say is if you do want to help

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.320
and you're in that sort of space, recognise it's

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:04.120
a long-term battle, recognise it's not all on you.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.360
We are not able to give jobs and work

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.160
to everybody who wants to support.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.760
What we would ask you to do is always

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.840
watch and understand the videos, share the

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.760
videos, share the message, get good at explaining

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.640
in a simple way that the reason the economy is

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.520
getting worse is because of growing inequality,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.360
and just build that message, build that message.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.320
If you're an ordinary person,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.480
that's all we would ask of you.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.680
If you are somebody who is in some position

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.520
of power, like you... you are on the political

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.480
Left or you are on the political Right, I

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.280
think you should be asking yourself, how can

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.800
you create spaces for other people to get

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.640
involved so that they can support this message?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.560
But the final big realisation that I made in that

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.720
period when I was trying to figure out ways to fix it

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.520
was basically that the fire engines are not coming.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.000
So, there are these institutions in society that are

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.600
supposed to protect us from economic collapse,

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.640
which are most obviously the politicians, but also

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.600
the academic economists, institutions like central

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.400
banks, which are full of economists that are supposed

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.200
protect your country's economy, things

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.280
like the civil service, things like the media.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.560
These guys are all supposed to

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.040
realise there is an economic collapse.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.040
And the big thing that I realised after leaving

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.480
the bank is that basically these institutions are all

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.000
kind of broken and not able to recognise that basically

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.960
what is happening is being caused by inequality.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.120
And that was kind of the second

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.920
big shocking realisation for me.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.440
And it's also another big shocking realisation,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.360
I think for... to give to ordinary people.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.000
The truth is, the institutions that are supposed

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.440
to protect your economy are not functioning.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.000
They're unable to realise

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.360
that inequality is the core problem.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.240
That's another thing we just need to sit and

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.680
take a long breath and think about, because

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.040
that means that if you are just a regular person,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.800
the responsibility to protect your family and

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.360
your kids' and your grandkids' future falls upon you.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.440
And that is another thing which is going to freak

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.240
people out from a mental health perspective.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.160
But I think the way to deal with it

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.360
is to understand it, to accept it, and to find

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.520
some way that you can contribute fixing things.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.840
Take it easy.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.200
Don't work too hard.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.560
Support us.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.360
If you are able to get yourself into a

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.600
position of power, we really, really need to

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.480
get this idea better understood amongst people

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.720
like politicians, economic academics,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:38.440
economists, the media, civil servants.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.480
We need these think tanks.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.640
We need these people to understand better.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.880
If you do not deal with growing

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.720
inequality, your society will collapse.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.960
And if you are working in one of those spaces or are able

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.480
to work in one of those spaces, please try your best to

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.560
spread that message so that people can understand it.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.400
So that brings us to where we are now basically.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:03.400
The message that I want to send across is that

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.880
the reality of the situation is really, really bad.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.240
That is a massive opportunity because it is going to

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.160
damage 90% of families in my country and your country.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.200
If we can unite those families, we can

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.640
definitely create change politically.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.120
But it is a massive blow to tell people that

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.640
that is going to happen, and we need to find ways

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.560
to support each other to get people to understand

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.040
what's happening and not freak the **** out.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.800
And that's true for me as

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.880
well, and it's true for you.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.560
Listen, I've known for 14 years now

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.000
that our economy was going to collapse, and,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.680
the truth is like for the last three years

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.480
I've known we had a real opportunity, a really

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.120
big opportunity to build something big here.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.240
I'm really proud of what we've built.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.760
I have probably pushed myself a bit too hard.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.320
I took six, seven weeks off earlier this

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.720
year, and I came back, and I was really

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.680
sort of gunning for it, ready to sort of

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.320
go and hold the politicians to account.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.920
And, I've been meeting people at think tanks.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.680
I've been speaking to politicians and celebrities

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.040
and trying to build... trying to build a bigger

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.200
social media infrastructure for these sort of ideas.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.720
But for the last few weeks, I've been really

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.920
struggling a little bit just to make videos, just

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.960
to sort of find the creativity to make good videos.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.280
It's a funny thing for me because my background is

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.680
maths and economics, and, I'm always really, really,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.440
really confident with the economics understanding.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.240
I'm really confident at trading.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.440
But this YouTube and also the book,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.960
it's not just about understanding the economy.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.040
A huge part of it is this kind of creative

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.000
job of how do you package it, how do you make

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.200
it compelling, how do you draw people in?

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.120
And it's really, it's that kind of creative

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.600
energy that I've been struggling a little bit

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.200
with recently, and it's, it's the first time

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.800
that's ever really happened to me, to be honest.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800
When I wrote the book, it was kind of amazing,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.280
I could just... it took a long time for

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.760
me to figure out the shape of it, but once

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.400
I had that, it just really flowed through.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.600
And for the last sort of two, three years, I've taken

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.680
these big breaks, but I've felt really, really

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.160
confident about the creative product we've been making.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.400
And especially the first half of this year,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.440
I thought the videos were amazing, and I really

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.360
wanted come back and really hit the ground running

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.960
with videos, but I'm honestly just starting

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.880
to feel like I'm a little bit running on empty.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.640
And that, and that's been difficult for me.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.600
But I think I've got my

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.760
plan for what I'm going to do.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.560
I'm going to mix up videos a bit.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.640
You might find this surprising.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.200
I hate talking to camera, and if

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.240
you look at the older videos we used to do,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.320
I used to do a lot of videos where I would talk

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.880
to, my mate Simran used to stand over here, and,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.400
I found those videos way, way easier to make.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.720
I think I might need to basically

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.560
reduce a little bit my shoot days, and

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.760
only do some to camera and do some off camera.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.160
I think I'm going to have to do that

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.560
basically in order to slow things down.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.160
It's disappointing for me because,

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.480
I really feel like we're sort of, we're

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.120
really getting close to building something.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.600
But I can only carry as much as I can carry, and,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.560
basically I need you guys to do a little bit more.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.520
I need especially... If you are somebody

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.400
who has influence in one of those spaces,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.320
the political left, the political right,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.440
government, politicians, media, civil servants,

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.480
academia, I really need you guys to start

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.800
carrying it a bit more and push it a bit more.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.080
Because I don't think I'm going to be able to keep

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.400
pushing it as much as I have been the last few years.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.120
But I'm not going to take a break.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.560
We're going to keep shooting at least

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.440
for another couple of months.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.000
Look, the strategy is simple.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.160
If we've got enough people, we don't need

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.080
individuals to throw themselves at the barricades.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.720
We don't need individuals to burn themselves out.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.560
Understand the message, spread it, bring people in.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.720
But we also need to build models of

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.800
strength that aren't just about individualism,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.680
people being the best, people being richest.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.000
Because the problem is here is really quite simple.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.520
If we can find enough people in this country,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.720
in your country, who are willing to be unselfish

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.160
enough that they don't prioritise just their

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.600
interests, but they work together to build and

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.000
spread a simple message, then their financial

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.240
interests will be protected in the long run.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.000
If we are a country that is too selfish, that it

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.960
cannot find enough people to protect their collective

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.160
interests, then most people will be bankrupted.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.640
So it's kind of this beautiful irony in

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.200
a way, which is if people are so

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.600
blinded by their selfish material interests,

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.160
then they will be materially bankrupted.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.360
But if enough people can stand together to work

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.680
together to protect their joint material interests,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.520
then their material interests will be protected.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.400
So it's a battle in a sense

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.360
for the soul of the country.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.760
I know which side I'm going to fight on.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.200
I hope you fight too.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.920
You know, I've mentioned Margaret Thatcher in this

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.120
video, and she said once, "There is, no such thing

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.520
as society." I think what she meant by that was

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.120
it is the job of all of us to simply protect ourselves.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.200
The problem is we are in a competition for

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.560
resources here, and if we deal with this

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.960
in a series of one-on-one battles,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.080
then basically the rich will take everything.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.000
So if we live in a society of individuals

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.160
where nobody helps each other, where nobody protects

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.200
each other, then who protects the poor from the rich?

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.760
So that's it basically.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.800
My video on mental health.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.520
I think it's difficult to be mentally well

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.120
when you're in society that's falling apart,

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.760
especially a society that tells us

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.880
our individual responsibilities are only to

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.600
ourselves, but makes it almost impossible

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.040
for us protect ourselves individually.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.960
I think the way for us to stay

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.360
mentally healthy is... is to fight back,

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.880
but to fight back in a way that is balanced.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.320
Don't burn yourself out.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.360
Support each other.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.640
You're going to need each other.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.760
All right, that's it for this week.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.040
We're going to do some more,

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.560
off-camera stuff I think.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.280
I've got a couple of good ones coming up.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.880
One about how to build a wealth tax in

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.160
terms of implementation, and one about

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.280
why you need to forget about money.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.240
Yeah, we're going to try some

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.520
new sort of video styles out.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.520
Let us know what you think when you see them.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.360
That's it.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.240
Thanks for your support.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240
Tax wealth, not work.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.640
Thank you.
