so a lot of people are reaching out to him now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.520
because millions of people are worried about&nbsp;
the energy prices going up they're already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.840
struggling with the food prices going up they&nbsp;
know that food prices are going to go up more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.760
and they know that the tax rises are going to come&nbsp;
in very soon as well so this is a very serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.360
situation we've spoken about a lot a lot of&nbsp;
people are really struggling for money right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.040
so they're reaching out to Martin Lewis the&nbsp;
money saving expert to say you know how&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.160
can we cope with this basically so&nbsp;
this guy Martin Lewis he went on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.320
breakfast tv yesterday and he basically said&nbsp;
look all these guys are reaching out to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.320
and i'm in a situation where i've run out&nbsp;
of things to tell these people basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.400
like we're reaching the point now where&nbsp;
people are literally going to be losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.640
thousands of pounds every year and there's there's&nbsp;
no way you can fix that by just optimizing your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.840
personal finances you know you're not going to fix&nbsp;
that by like switching to a new gas provider like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.240
there's no way everything is expensive right um&nbsp;
and the first thing is to say like this shows how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.800
extreme the situation is and the situation is very&nbsp;
extreme but the second thing is this reminds me of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.440
we make a lot of videos right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800
very often what comes back from the&nbsp;
videos people send messages saying

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.160
what can i do in terms of they know i'm a trader&nbsp;
they're like can i make money from trading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.560
for example or can i make money from investing&nbsp;
just now we filmed a video in the parking here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.680
and some kids came up to us and said oh do you&nbsp;
give advice on personal finance right and totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080
understand this i understand this you know i mean&nbsp;
i've been poor myself you see things happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.680
and you're just like what can i do to protect&nbsp;
myself protect my family to make money right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.280
but the problem is we're in a situation here where&nbsp;
because effectively of government mismanagement &nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.320
of crisis managing a crisis in such a way that all&nbsp;
the pain goes on poor and ordinary people and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.200
rich make like a properly a crap ton of money&nbsp;
we've created a situation where increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.280
no matter what you do you can't protect yourself&nbsp;
you know what i mean but we've created a society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.320
where we put the responsibility of protecting&nbsp;
individuals on the individuals meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.680
the government is doing nothing to protect&nbsp;
individuals and is actively making the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.600
of individuals worse but the natural response of&nbsp;
people is to say what can i do for me i understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.120
that so they contact me and say what can i do for&nbsp;
trading or they go online and they try and trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.040
bitcoin or they try and get involved in fx trading&nbsp;
or they contact martin lewis and they say you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.760
what can i do to optimize my finances but the&nbsp;
problem is if everybody is successfully convinced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.160
that what you need to do is focus on your&nbsp;
personal individual situation and at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.840
time the government is basically [ __ ] everybody&nbsp;
over we increasingly get in a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.320
people don't fight back and while every single&nbsp;
person is individually trying to save themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.520
the government is just screwing everybody it's a&nbsp;
bit like you know and then kung fu films when like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.880
100 bad guys fight bruce lee one at a time that's&nbsp;
basically what we're doing you know like the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.400
are taking everything and the only power we have&nbsp;
is there's more of us and we are like individually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.720
one at a time i like well maybe i can change my&nbsp;
electricity provider or maybe i can make money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.000
trading bitcoin you know what i mean but you're&nbsp;
fighting against millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.600
here you know what i mean you're not going to&nbsp;
beat these guys these guys want your house they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.280
want your house they want your house they want&nbsp;
your money they want your pension they want your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.200
assets they want you in debt and it's not because&nbsp;
they're evil it's just because they're rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.040
and they can do it right and you are not going to&nbsp;
fight back by you know changing your electricity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.720
provider you know what i mean or doing these&nbsp;
individual things if you are just a person who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.880
has a net worth of 50 60 grand you can't beat&nbsp;
these guys with a net worth of 50 60 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.160
but we live in a world where people are being&nbsp;
convinced you have to do you have to take care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.160
of just yourself and you have to compete with&nbsp;
the millionaires and yet people are not uniting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.080
meanwhile the rich and the government are&nbsp;
just screwing everybody you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.320
so i think what this made me realize is and i&nbsp;
reached out to martin lewis hopefully it'd be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.840
great if he reaches back people watching send&nbsp;
a message to mike lewis tell him to contact me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.440
we're in a situation here where&nbsp;
unless ordinary people unite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.800
in some meaningful way it's going to be&nbsp;
seriously it's going to be a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.320
and it is happening it's happening now&nbsp;
it's a disaster you know what i'm saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.720
um and people who've watched it might be seeing me&nbsp;
getting like increasingly like angry in my videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.720
because you know i've been out here saying for&nbsp;
like more than 10 years now if you don't deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.560
with inequality it's going to be an economic&nbsp;
disaster for ordinary people and it is you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.800
unaffordable housing no good jobs you know bad&nbsp;
quality of living unable to afford the basics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.680
and now suddenly we have a crisis that massively&nbsp;
increases inequality and it's going to get worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.800
um and the only way the only way the only way&nbsp;
we're going to stop this is if ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.760
poor and ordinary people on mass come together and&nbsp;
demand it because look the chancellor's father-in-law&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.400
is a billionaire he's not going to give it to&nbsp;
us right and all of the government they're all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.760
super super rich guys right they're not going to&nbsp;
give it to us and they're funded by even richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.560
guys they're not going to give it to us we are&nbsp;
only going to improve this if we come together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.120
to push back and yet everybody's just looking for&nbsp;
money-saving tips you know it's not going to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.200
money-saving tips listen money-saving tips is not&nbsp;
going to work when somebody's setting your house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.040
and your community on fire you know what i'm&nbsp;
saying and that is what is happening here you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.600
know what i mean you know if your country is being&nbsp;
invaded you don't need money saving tips you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.760
to fight back and that is what is happening here&nbsp;
you know our wealth as a community as a country is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.800
being taken by the super rich and by essentially&nbsp;
a corrupt government to be honest you know if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.680
have a government that has a crisis enriches the&nbsp;
riches massively takes away food and energy from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.880
the poor raises taxes on ordinary people and cuts&nbsp;
taxes on the super rich with a chancellor who's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.200
billionaire that is a corrupt government you know&nbsp;
what i mean it's a corrupt government you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.480
you can talk about corruption in the Russian 
government look at our government look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.800
what they are doing to this country you know what&nbsp;
i mean so yeah i think Martin Lewis is a great guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.920
you know do what you can to protect yourself&nbsp;
and your family but the fact is this is beyond the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.920
money saving tips and if we do not unite ordinary&nbsp;
people who do not come together as ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.080
and demand a fairer distribution of wealth&nbsp;
and demand not only that the rich stop getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.920
richer but that we get something back then&nbsp;
things are going to keep getting worse so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.440
so yeah i would encourage people watching get&nbsp;
involved support the message and understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.640
crucially we need to do something about wealth&nbsp;
and equality and that will only be achieved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.960
acting together and acting politically and i'm not&nbsp;
talking about political parties i'm talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.560
politics as the exercise of power and our power is&nbsp;
there's more of us and we only use that if we come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.520
together and if we do not come together we lose&nbsp;
and if we lose we see what's happening we lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.680
our houses we lose the ability to live financially&nbsp;
secure lives and that's what's going to happen um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.120
so yeah people need to come together you&nbsp;
know and i would love them to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.880
this message and to share it that's all&nbsp;
and if Martin Lewis is watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:57.840
send me a message because we need to make&nbsp;
stuff happen, that's it, what else is there to say?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.200
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.520
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:17.600
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
