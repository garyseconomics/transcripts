00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.520
Today, we're going to explain why

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.600
rent, profits and interest are all the same thing.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
So I wanted to bring it back to basics

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.280
and do a nice educational video

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.320
that is going to help you to understand

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560
the way the economy works.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.760
Now, I've always considered rent,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.720
profits and interest

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.080
to be basically transformations of the same thing,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.720
but I don't think many people think of them in that way.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.440
So I want to explain why I think this

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.520
I think is going to help you explain

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.040
basically the structure of our economy.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.840
Now, the first thing to say is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.520
the title is not to be taken exactly, literally, of course.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.080
There are important differences

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.600
between rent, profits and interests.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.200
And we're going to explain them

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720
in more detail in this video.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200
But in a very real important sense,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.280
these three things are all the same thing.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.920
And the way they can basically be described

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.560
is all three, rent, profits and interests

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.760
are payments

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.960
that are made by poorer people, the non owners of assets,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.360
to richer people,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.200
the owners of assets in order to use those assets.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.840
And I think the best way to explain

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.800
how that works is to go through an example.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.080
So let's say I've got half a million pounds

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.960
and you are a person who has nowhere to live

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.520
and you need somewhere to live.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.240
So you come to me

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.880
and you say, alright

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.240
Gary, I've got nowhere to live,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.840
you've got a half million pounds,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240
can you help me to get a house to live in?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.400
We can do this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.080
and we can structure this in three different ways.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.480
So number one, the most obvious way, is

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.600
I use that half million pounds to buy a house,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.320
I rent that house to you.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.920
This is the classic landlord tenant relationship.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.080
I buy the house.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.040
I rent it to you. You pay me £25,000 a year rent.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.680
Number one,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.080
rents.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.120
The second way we can do is I lend you the money.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.720
I lend you the half million pounds.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.920
You buy the house

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.840
and then you pay me

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.680
£25,000 interest every year, in order to live in the house.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.640
So now you're paying £25,000, the same amount,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.480
but in interest.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.440
And the third way

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760
that we construct this is, I set up a company,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.680
I use the company to buy a house.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.200
You live in the house.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.800
You pay £25,000 a year rent to the company.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
That company makes £25,000

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.040
a year profits, and it pays it to me in dividends.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.720
So in all three of these cases,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440
I use my half million pounds to buy a house.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.480
I'm allowing you to live in that house

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.760
and you are paying me £25,000 a year to live in the house.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.240
But in situation one, I receive rent.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.640
In situation number two, I receive interest.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
And in situation number three,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.240
I receive dividends from profits.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.600
So you see from the perspective of me

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.240
as a wealthy person, as an investor,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.240
once I have a certain amount of wealth,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.160
I can buy, in this case,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.000
the exact same asset, the exact same house

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.640
in three different ways.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.360
And the financial structure

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.400
I choose around that purchase

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
basically determines

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.360
whether I receive rent, interest or dividends.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.880
So for me as an investor, they're basically the same thing.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.240
I have half a million pounds.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.320
I want to receive some sort of passive income stream

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.320
and I can choose what to do. And for me

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.160
it's really easy to transfer between the two.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.640
So let's say I chose the third option

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.960
and I bought the house in a company.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.160
Eventually, I’m thinking, okay,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400
the structure of a company is not working for me.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.680
I'm going to collapse the company.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.640
I'm going to take direct ownership of the property.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.160
Now I'm receiving rent directly,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.400
so I don't want to receive rent anymore.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.440
I want to start receiving interests.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.880
Okay, well, I sell the house.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.960
I'll buy government bonds.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.720
Now I'm receiving interest from the government.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000
I can sell those government bonds

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.080
and I can buy mortgage bonds.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.040
Now I'm receiving, again

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.200
your mortgage interest payments for the house.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.520
That's not working for me. I sell it.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.480
I buy the stock market.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.360
Now I'm receiving company profits.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600
So from the perspective of the individual, it's

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.480
super easy to transfer between these things.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.800
And I think,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.320
I think ordinary people don't tend to realise that.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.840
Basically, once you are a wealthy person,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.320
you own a certain amount of assets.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.160
Even by buying just the same asset,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.320
you can choose to receive rent, interest, dividends,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.360
which is profit. They're basically the same thing.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.160
And in all three cases

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.600
that cash flow,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.680
you know, many people describe these cash

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.320
flows on the internet as passive income.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.080
In all three cases, it's not really passive income.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.640
It's money that comes from you.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.880
I own the house,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.520
you live in the house and you're paying me your salary

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.040
to live in the house.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.040
And this is basically what all of these things are.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.120
These are payments made by you.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.240
A poorer person who does not have assets

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.880
to me, a rich person who has assets

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720
in order to use those assets.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.320
And it goes a lot beyond housing.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560
Let's say you book a flight, you go to Portugal with EasyJet,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.920
you go to the barber, let's take the flight situation.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.600
You need a plane.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.920
So as a very wealthy person,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.440
I could own a plane and I could rent it to EasyJet.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440
And part of your ticket

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.520
will go towards that rental of the plane, which goes to me.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.400
Or I could buy EasyJet stock. Part of your

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.160
ticket price goes towards EasyJet profits,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.280
which comes to me.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.160
Or I can lend money to EasyJet,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.200
in which case part of your ticket

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.480
goes to interest payments again, to me.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.040
So once again,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.560
when you buy this ticket,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.720
some of that money is going to me

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.680
as the owner of the assets.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.440
If you go to the barber,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.240
somebody owns that barber shop

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.520
and it could be that the barber is paying

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.480
rent to the owner of the property,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.240
or it could be that the owner has taken a loan

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.040
to buy that property to pay interest to use the property.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.160
Or it could be that

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.880
that barber is part

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.920
of a big barber corporation

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.240
and all of those properties are owned by the shareholders

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240
and they receive the profits.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.600
So in both cases, whether you’re taking a plane,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.960
living in a house,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.360
going to get your haircut,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.200
you are paying some amount of money

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.160
to the owners of the physical assets that are being used.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.120
The owners receive that in either profits, interest

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.600
or rent directly.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.960
And you know,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.640
this is even the case with the other

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.080
basic essentials that you need.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.240
You know,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.200
when you buy food, a big chunk of that goes

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.400
towards the owners of the farmland.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.360
And again, that can take any one of these forms.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.960
When you use energy to heat your home,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.920
a big part of that money goes towards the owners

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.560
of the energy production infrastructure in our country.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.960
Now, I want to talk a little bit about

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.080
a couple of big exceptions,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.440
because I know there's going to be people

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.960
out there that say, listen,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.360
if I buy a property

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.120
with a mortgage that's totally different from renting,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.120
renting is money down the drain.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.400
If I buy a house with a mortgage,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.000
I can pay the mortgage off over time, I'm building up

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.320
equity in my house over time.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.080
These two things are totally different,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.760
and from one perspective, that is totally true.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.840
If you as an individual rent a house,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.360
you are not the legal owner of the house.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.560
But if you take a mortgage and buy the house,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.880
you are the legal owner of the house.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.080
But let's go back to my example, right.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.240
You know,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.120
let's assume I've used half a million pounds to

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.760
buy a property, rent it to my sister.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.200
She pays £25,000 a year rent.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.120
If I lend £500,000 to my sister,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.720
she buys the property, she pays £25,000 interest.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.320
Now, assuming

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.200
she doesn't make any extra payments above the interest

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.760
in both cases, financially

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.400
her situation is exactly the same, basically.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.280
She pays £25,000 a year rent

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.480
or she pays £25,000 a year interest.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.840
So financially

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.560
there's no difference between these two things.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.320
But there is one

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.520
very big important technical difference between buying with

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.360
a mortgage and renting,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.520
which is who bears

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.560
the risk of changes in the price, changes in the value.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.760
And I think this is the reason why people in this country

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360
are so keen on buying with mortgages.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.640
So if you rent and the price of the property goes up,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.680
you are unaffected. You don't own the property,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.680
but if you buy with the mortgage

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.280
and the price of the property goes up,

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.760
you take the, you take the profit, basically.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.880
You take the upward movement in price.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.000
And of course, in the last 30,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.120
40 years, house prices in this country

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.320
and in most countries in the world have gone

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.320
very aggressively up

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.360
with only a few sort of downward hiccups,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.040
which means that if you as an individual

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.520
have chosen to buy with a mortgage,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.560
you would have done massively better

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.600
than if you have chosen to rent over the last 40 years.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600
But I think it's important

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.320
to realise the only real reason that

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.160
people have used mortgages

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.040
and paid interest

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.760
rather than people who have rented and paid rent have done

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.280
better is basically because prices have gone up

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.120
really aggressively.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.680
If prices hadn't gone up

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.840
really aggressively., you'd be in

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.720
pretty much the exact same situation.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720
And I think it's worth

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.480
also recognising that if prices had gone down,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.320
people who had bought with mortgages would have been

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.000
totally screwed.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.160
If you buy a property with a big mortgage,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.000
the price goes down.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.400
You can become bankrupted extremely quickly.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.800
This is what happened in Japan in the early nineties

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.880
when the housing market popped.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.240
There was an enormous number of people

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.240
immediately bankrupted.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.680
But I think it's

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.680
important to say I've said many times on this channel,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.320
I think house prices will continue to go up.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.080
So I'm not saying you shouldn't buy with mortgages,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.600
but it's important to recognise that

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.960
both ways of doing it, buying with a mortgage or renting,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.360
you will pay an enormous amount

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.080
of either rent or interest

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.280
to either

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.880
the guy who provided the loan or the owner of the house,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.360
which is essentially the same thing.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.480
There's no way of getting out of it,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.040
If you do not own any wealth

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.440
and you want to live in a house,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.760
you will pay these huge amounts of passive income,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.040
either way. Using a mortgage or using rent.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.440
The only difference is in one case you bear the price risk,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.720
which is good if prices go up and they probably will,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.000
but terrible if prices go down.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.920
And the other way, you don't.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.160
So I think the reason that this is important to understand

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.920
that rent, interest

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.720
and profits are the same thing

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.960
is because it helps us to recognise that underneath

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.080
these enormous amount of different cash flows,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.280
which can take different names,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.440
there exists a real country with real things.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.160
There are

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.000
real houses, real commercial buildings,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.360
there is real farmland, there are real natural resources.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.240
And every time you use those things,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
every time you live in a house,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.680
every time you eat food, every time you use energy,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.040
you are paying money to the owners

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.400
of those natural resources.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.360
And whether it's called profits,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.640
whether it's called interest, or whether it's called rent,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.280
it's always the same thing, basically.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.120
You as an individual

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.960
without wealth have to pay money to the individuals

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.440
who own the assets in order to basically live your life.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.480
And this is essentially why

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.080
it's kind of inevitable that unless you

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.840
take some sort of preventative measures, wealth inequality

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.440
will and does tend to get higher over time.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.760
And that's because, you know, you

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.440
as an individual,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.640
you have an income of 30, 40 or 50 grand a year.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.160
You spend the vast majority of that on

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.600
living in a house, eating food,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.800
using energy, other essential costs.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.920
And your salary goes in the form of profit, interest, rents

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.080
to the owners of the asset.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.240
So after you've paid your essential costs,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.160
you’re only maybe making,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.920
you know, 10, 15 grand a year if you're lucky,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.320
and the rest of your money has gone

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.560
to the owners of the assets.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.680
So there's this massive constant drive of cash from the non

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.600
owners of assets, less rich people,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.320
to the owners of assets, richer people.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400
And while that is happening,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.560
these guys accumulate money

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.520
which they will inevitably use

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.160
to buy the rest of the assets.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.640
So to conclude,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.680
one of the big reasons I wanted to bring this up

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.520
is because I wanted people to realise that

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.200
because rent and interest are in many ways the same thing.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.400
Owning property, but with

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.320
increasingly enormous amounts of debt

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.120
is very similar to not owning properties at all.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.120
And the reason why it's important that you understand

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.080
this is generationally in this country,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.960
whilst there is still a sort of big middle

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.760
class of property owners,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
those property owners are increasingly needing

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.520
larger and larger amounts of debt

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.360
in order to own the properties.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.720
So if we consider my granddad's generation, by 40

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.520
in many cases

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.520
they would have paid off the majority of their mortgage

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.520
and be close to owning their property.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.040
Whereas my dad's generation

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.320
would probably be about halfway there by 40.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.840
And my generation will, in many cases,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.640
still having 90 or 80% mortgages

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.920
by the time they're 40 because they will

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.320
in many cases have only just bought.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.800
And I think this ties in nicely to the video from last week

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.680
where we spoke about the illusion of improvement.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.160
And the way that individuals

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.080
when they focus narrowly on their own

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.640
financial situation, may feel that they are improving,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.920
whereas generationally

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.200
their family is getting poorer over time.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200
So individuals who own their own property with a mortgage,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.160
they will be slowly paying their debt down

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.640
and they will often feel like I'm doing

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.840
when I'm getting richer without realising

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.240
that their children and grandchildren

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.400
are in a much worse situation,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.240
largely because of the much higher property prices.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.800
And will need to have much higher levels of debt.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.440
So even though you

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.640
as individual are becoming less indebted over time,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.800
you as a family are becoming more indebted over time.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.880
This is really important to understand.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.480
It's happening to our governments as well,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.800
and governments are increasingly going in debt

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.880
to the rich, paying large amounts of interest to the rich.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.840
Families are doing the same thing.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.440
This is a big way that we lose our middle class

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.680
and our country falls into poverty.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.640
So you need to be aware.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.360
You need to understand interest,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.760
rent, profits all the same thing.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.280
Payments made

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.280
from poor people to rich people

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.240
that make wealth inequality get higher.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.360
We're going to keep talking about it

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.080
until we understand it. Thank you very much.
