00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.800
okay so what we're going to do in this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.760
is a really clear explanation of what's going&nbsp;
to happen in the post-covid economy

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.920
if we don't do anything about&nbsp;the
massive increase in inequality now

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.600
okay those of you who've been following this&nbsp;
channel from the start will have seen in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.000
very first video on this channel i predicted&nbsp;
that Covid would cause a massive increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.560
inequality, increasing house prices, increasing&nbsp;
stock prices, increasing inflation and a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.600
increase in cash accumulation by the richest&nbsp;
people in our society - those things have now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.160
all come true - people who know about my career&nbsp;
before i started doing this will know that i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.680
was one of the world's most successful traders and&nbsp;
economic forecasters coming out of the 2008 crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.680
so i know a lot about what happens after&nbsp;
economic disasters and the way they affect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.160
the economy we need to talk about what is&nbsp;
going to happen in the next couple of years

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.680
now i'm going to say right from the start&nbsp;
okay these are not going to be optimistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.800
predictions okay if we don't take any action&nbsp;
against a massive increase in equality that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.240
happened in the last couple of years the future&nbsp;
is going to be pretty bleak i'm going to say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.000
right from the start okay this is not going to&nbsp;
be an optimistic video if we don't take action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360
things are going to be really bad for ordinary&nbsp;
families in this country and around the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.240
but we need to talk about it because the only way&nbsp;
we can prevent these bad things from happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.120
is if we understand the significance of inequality&nbsp;
so we get people together to do something about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.160
okay my biggest biggest economic concern for&nbsp;
the next couple of years is that the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.120
and economists in the media completely ignore&nbsp;
the massive increase in cash accumulation by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.000
the richest you can already see it right now&nbsp;
when we look at the huge amount of inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.640
which as you know i predicted at the beginning of&nbsp;
Covid based on a massive cash accumulation by &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.240
the rich the media is only talking about that in the&nbsp;
context of the Ukraine-Russia war it's very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.520
important you do not let people say that this is&nbsp;
caused solely by the war there has been a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.640
accumulation of cash by the richest people the&nbsp;
reason it's important that people understand this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.600
is if it starts to be accepted generally that the&nbsp;
inflation is only due to the war then we're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.440
going to do anything about this massive massive&nbsp;
cash accumulation right so if we have this massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.920
cash accumulation and we do nothing about it then&nbsp;
we are going to move forward with the average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.880
richest people in this country sitting on&nbsp;
a hundred grand extra cash than pre-covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.760
so what's happening now it's basically an&nbsp;
economic experiment what happens if you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
print a hundred grand for each rich person in&nbsp;
the country and give them each hundred grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.520
that is what's happening okay if we go forward&nbsp;
saying the inflation is only because of Ukraine

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
then we're going to ignore that cash which means&nbsp;
they will keep that cash so what is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.800
happen to society if every single super-rich&nbsp;
person is sitting on 100 grand in the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.400
they're not going to keep that cash sitting&nbsp;
in the bank they're going to use it primarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.440
to buy assets okay what that means is they're&nbsp;
buying assets from ordinary or poorer people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.880
but also they're going to push up the prices&nbsp;
of natural resources we've seen that massively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.720
in Covid right so consider what's happening now&nbsp;
okay your average rich person has 100 extra cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.320
your average ordinary or poorer person is&nbsp;
looking at Â£3000 a year extra in bills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.520
so this means ordinary and poor families are&nbsp;
going to have to start selling their assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.600
to richer families in order to sustain their&nbsp;
quality of life and their kids quality of life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.680
so what you see is fewer and fewer&nbsp;
ordinary families owning property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.080
and richer people getting more and more of the&nbsp;
real assets in the economy the other thing they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.680
going to do is start loading that money out that's&nbsp;
going to mean there's more money to be borrowed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.120
the economy which is going to push house prices&nbsp;
up even further so you're going to move to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.120
situation where richer families are buying the&nbsp;
houses of poor families more specifically you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.040
going to see kids from richer families able to&nbsp;
pay huge amounts of money for property which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560
means kids from poorer families don't ever&nbsp;
get property this creates a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.640
ordinary kids ordinary young people from ordinary&nbsp;
families spend longer times renting which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.000
they pay more rent to the rich and if they do buy&nbsp;
property they have to buy using bigger mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.080
which means bigger mortgage payments for a longer&nbsp;
period of time to the rich and they will possibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.200
never pay those mortgages off in the whole of&nbsp;
their lifetimes so what we're looking at is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.880
future where ordinary families cannot own property&nbsp;
increasingly and if they can own property it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.720
using bigger and bigger mortgages whereas richer&nbsp;
families own more of the properties and have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.840
enormous amounts of debt owed to them from the&nbsp;
rest of us so what does that mean right that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.880
ordinary families then number one first they've&nbsp;
lost disposable income because the increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
food and energy prices which is largely caused&nbsp;
by the massive increase in cash held by the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.280
secondly they have to rent for longer third if&nbsp;
they can buy they have to buy bigger mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.280
so all of these things are draining cash out&nbsp;
from the bank account of ordinary people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.000
putting that cash into the bank accounts of richer&nbsp;
people who own the properties receive the rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.160
own the mortgages receive the interest and&nbsp;
own the natural resources so receive the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.680
money when the natural resources go up so&nbsp;
every single thing that is happening here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.640
is dragging cash out of ordinary families bank&nbsp;
accounts and putting it into the bank accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.280
of richer people so the long-term consequences&nbsp;
of this increase in covid inequality is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.960
a sucking a draining of cash from the ordinary&nbsp;
families from the middle class of this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.600
and all of that cash going to the rich but what&nbsp;
does it mean if ordinary people don't have money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.520
well it means ordinary people can't go to&nbsp;
the pub, they can't go to the cinema, they can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.280
go to the theatre, they can't go to the football,&nbsp;
they can't go on holiday right but these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.640
things that drive the economy right if ordinary&nbsp;
people can't spend money then the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.640
economy is going to be starved of customers right&nbsp;
and what you're going to see is this splitting in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.560
society where increasingly ordinary families have&nbsp;
basically nothing and the rich have everything and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.200
then the economy which relies upon the spending&nbsp;
of ordinary people is going to be starved of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.600
spending so even if you yourself are not affected&nbsp;
your job will be affected so what you'll see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.680
then is wages being dragged down but who receives&nbsp;
wages ordinary people receive wages who pays wages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.400
the business owners which are the rich people&nbsp;
so every single thing that is happening here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.200
dragging cash and resources away from the ordinary&nbsp;
families of this country and giving it to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.040
and on top of all this the number one thing is we&nbsp;
are not taxing the super rich we are taxing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.920
at super low rates so we're sucking the wealth&nbsp;
and the income out of this country and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.000
giving it to this tiny group of elite super rich&nbsp;
people who pay no tax this is the equivalent of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.800
your neighbor giving his house away giving all of&nbsp;
his money away to somebody who doesn't care about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.680
him and will never give it to him back if we give&nbsp;
all of the resources of this country to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.720
who don't pay tax we might as well be giving it&nbsp;
to aliens these guys are not going to support our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.160
economy and look i'm not just saying this i bet&nbsp;
that this exact thing would happen after 2008 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.960
lead to a prolonged economic crisis a prolonged&nbsp;
stagnation in ordinary living conditions okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.600
if we don't do anything about&nbsp;
the rising inequality now

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.480
you know i'm not going to put a fine point on&nbsp;
it is going to be the death of the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.240
for this country for ordinary families&nbsp;
over the next five ten years - it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.760
dominate this economy for the next five ten&nbsp;
years and the realistic consequence of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.600
we're not just talking about the poorest&nbsp;
people ordinary people if you are in the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.720
of this country the 50th percentile your kids will&nbsp;
not get a house because of what is happening now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.040
that is what is going to happen you know what&nbsp;
i mean and even if you're richer than that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.600
your grandkids are not going to get&nbsp;
a house because we are draining the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:59.200
resources of this economy and giving it to&nbsp;
the super rich who do not pay any tax okay so

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.200
that's what's going to happen the human&nbsp;
consequences are going to be terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.160
i'm betting on that happening&nbsp;
because i think it's going to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.000
the number one thing which is going to&nbsp;
determine whether this happens or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.280
is whether ordinary people understand that&nbsp;
the problems we are facing now economically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.960
are caused by the massive cash accumulation of&nbsp;
the richest people if ordinary people understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.200
that then they can demand from politicians&nbsp;
look we are not going to vote for anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.360
unless they do something serious about taxation&nbsp;
of the richest and let me address one other thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.960
now okay to people out there who are going&nbsp;
to say look you can't tax the riches because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.880
they'll leave okay look at what look what's&nbsp;
happening now right look at roman abramovich okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.680
he's losing all of his assets in this country&nbsp;
again it doesn't matter where roman abramovic is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.080
because his assets are here in this country&nbsp;
okay and what is happening now with the russian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.120
oligarchs is making it super clear we can tax&nbsp;
these people it doesn't matter if they leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.760
their assets are here and we can tax them and if&nbsp;
we don't tax them then the future is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.640
really really bad for the people of this country&nbsp;
and i'm not just saying that i've been betting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.840
this for 15 years i've made millions of pounds&nbsp;
doing it and that is what is going to happen

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.560
oh yeah we'll take that for our&nbsp;
first take shall we? yeah 

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.560
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.880
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.360
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
