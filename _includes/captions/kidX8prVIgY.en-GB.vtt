00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.120
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.480
Today we are going to explain mortgages.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.080
Okay, I wanted to do a video on mortgages.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.240
And the reason being is

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.200
I talk a lot in this video

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.320
about wealth inequality increasing.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.160
That means wealth is being transferred

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.440
away from primarily

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.920
ordinary people, middle classes towards the very rich.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.160
And there's a variety of ways

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.080
in which we see that happening.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880
So number one is lower rates of homeownership.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.720
And we're really seeing that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.120
especially for younger people.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.960
Number two

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.440
is the lack of ability of people to accumulate

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.760
financial assets like stocks and shares.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.080
So we primarily see that through pensions.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.760
Older generations were much more able to accumulate

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.880
financial assets in pensions. And now they're not.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.680
Number three is the loss of government wealth,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.600
which means government

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.240
privatisations and increased government debt.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.800
But those first three...

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.720
well, the first one is very visible.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.920
The second one,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.960
less pensions

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.440
and less government wealth, we often don't see them.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.600
What we often

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.640
do see and one of the most visible ways

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
in which ordinary families are becoming poorer versus

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.680
the very rich is increased sizes of mortgages.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.160
And I wanted to speak a little bit about that,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.360
because I think a lot of people don't

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.240
see the way in which increased sizes of mortgages

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.440
is a transfer of wealth from

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
the middle class towards the super rich.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520
I think they kind of think

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.920
house prices going up, mortgages are bigger,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.040
that's just the way it is.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.280
And in this video I'm

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.600
going to explain

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.640
how increase to mortgage debt

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.800
is a manifestation of increased wealth inequality.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.360
So the first thing I need to explain

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.280
in order to explain

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.880
this is something that I have spoken

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.200
about before on the channel.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.880
We've got two videos, one called Debt and one called

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.920
What is Money?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.600
If you want to understand these concepts better,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.200
you can go and watch them afterwards.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.640
The basic concept which you need to understand is

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.040
total mortgage debt is always zero.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.280
This is the first you need to understand.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.160
Total mortgage debt is always zero.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.320
If you look at the amount of debt across

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.080
the whole society, mortgage debt is always zero.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.720
And that might seem crazy.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.240
You know,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.120
so many people have mortgages,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.360
how could it possibly add up to zero?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640
That is because

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.200
every debt has a creditor.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.320
For everyone who is in debt,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720
there is somebody who is in credit.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320
Your money is always owed to somebody.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.960
So what that means on a very simple level

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.560
is, the total amount of debt

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800
always has to equal the total amount of credit

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.080
and the total amount of mortgage interest

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.360
that is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.960
paid always has to equal the total

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.280
amount of mortgage interest

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.560
that is received by somebody.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.280
So what that means is, it is not possible for

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.560
mortgage debt to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040
grow massively for the middle classes,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.160
for ordinary families,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.360
unless somebody is accumulating a huge amount of money.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.200
Now this is an important concept,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.720
and I think I'm going to sit on it for a little bit

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.280
and explain it a little bit more clearly,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.640
because I think it's important

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.080
to understand

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.040
how debt works

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.600
and how money works in order to understand

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.160
how mortgages are working in our society.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.600
We live in a debt based monetary system.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.320
That's true whether you're in the UK,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.720
the US, Europe, Australia, anywhere.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.880
Our monetary system is a debt based monetary system.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.680
What I mean by

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.160
that is

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.120
all money in our society

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.480
is created by the making of a loan.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.040
So at the very first instance,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.480
money is created by, in this country,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.880
the Bank of England,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.400
lending money to a commercial bank

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400
such as Lloyds, Halifax, Barclays. So at that point

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.480
a bank borrows money from the Bank of England.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480
They get money and they also get debt.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.120
The money and the debt are created at the same time.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.800
And that's important

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.360
and it has to work like that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.080
because the person who has the money

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.000
receives the interest,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.160
and it is only possible to receive interest

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.640
if somebody is paying interest.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.240
And if somebody is paying interest,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.400
that means somebody has debt.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.960
Now all money in our monetary system works like this.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.200
It's not obvious that that is happening.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
And I'll explain why, I’ll give you an example.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.880
So say I borrow £100 from the bank.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.160
I've got £100.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.840
Then I use that £100 to pay Jack

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.440
for filming this video.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.080
Jack then has the £100, but he doesn't have the debt.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.960
I've got the debt.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.680
So from the perspective of Jack, he just thinks, well,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.520
I've got £100.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.720
You know, there's no debt against this £100.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.080
But if you look from the perspective

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.560
of the whole of society,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.120
there has to be a debt balancing it.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.120
And in this case, I'm the person with the debt.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.800
So I pay interest to the bank that lent me the money.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.000
And then the Bank of England pays interest to Jack. So

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.560
I really want to hammer this in.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.400
Because you need to understand this.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.920
All money is credit. All money is debt.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.680
All money is credit.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.640
All money is debt.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.080
In fact,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.000
I think you understand money better if you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.680
you almost stop using the term money at all

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.240
and you just think about money as credit.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.560
Every form of money is credit.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.960
What that means is

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.240
it is money owed to you by someone,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.040
and they pay you interest on that money.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.080
So if you have money in Barclays Bank, that's credit.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.320
Barclays owes you that money.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560
If you have a government bond that's credit

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.880
the government owes you that money.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.480
And even if we think about cash,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.800
if you pull a banknote out of your wallet,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.360
you will see at the top it says here,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.880
I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of £20.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.000
I don't think you'll be able to get that,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.400
but if you've got a £20 note.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.160
So even this cash is

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.680
essentially a form of credit

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.000
the government offers to pay you money.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.680
And if you give this money to a bank,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.480
the government will pay interest on this cash.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.800
That's why you can make money on cash.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.040
So all money is credit, and all money is debt.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.200
There is always somebody in debt

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.920
for every piece of money or credit anybody has.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.840
And that has to be true.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.000
Otherwise there would be nobody to pay the interest.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.920
On the flip side, if anybody has debt,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.320
there is always somebody with credit against it.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.280
This is the way money works.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.080
I always get some people get very angry

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.800
when I say this on the channel.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.160
Unfortunately, it is true.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
We live in a debt based monetary system.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.320
Debt and credit always have to totally equal.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520
So what this means is

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.440
if mortgage debt is suddenly exploding

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.000
and getting much bigger,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.840
somebody somewhere must be accumulating

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.800
an enormous amount of credit.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.600
Somebody somewhere must be accumulating

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.640
an enormous amount of money.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.360
And the reverse is also true.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.400
If some group

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.040
somewhere is accumulating an enormous amount of money,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.000
somebody must be going into debt.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.280
It's the only... it's the only way it works.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.800
These two things have to balance.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.440
So if one group in society tries to accumulate money,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.200
somebody else has to accumulate debt.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.480
If one group in society starts to accumulate debt

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.080
somebody else has to accumulate money.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.720
These debts and credits, this debt and money

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.680
that are the same thing,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.440
there are two sides of the same coin.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.800
One side cannot exist without the other.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.680
So when you see mortgage debt increasing massively,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.800
or for example,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.880
when you see government debt increasing

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.440
massively during Covid, you should be asking yourself

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.960
who is accumulating money here?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.400
And you should be understanding

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.280
it is only possible for those debts to increase

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.440
because a group is accumulating money.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.080
And in fact, if a group accumulates money,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.680
they are forcing somebody to go into debt.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.960
So in a very real sense,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.600
these increased mortgages, these increased debts

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.680
of ordinary families of the middle class,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.600
they literally

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.720
are the accumulations of wealth of the rich.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.160
It would not be possible

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.640
for your family, for your kids,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.240
for your grandkids to go massively into debt

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.720
unless some group of people, which in this case is...

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.400
which in this case is the very rich

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.840
are accumulating money.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.960
In fact, what you are seeing here

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.160
is a manifestation of what I talk about

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.440
in my Flows of Wealth video,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.000
which is when you live in a very wealth,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.640
unequal society, as increasingly we do.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.840
What that means is a small group of people own

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.440
all of the

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.600
companies, they own all of the commercial property,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.680
they own most of the properties.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.920
And ordinary people

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.560
are continually having to pay them rents,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.920
profits and interest.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.760
If inequality

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.360
gets very large,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.840
these flows of cash

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.880
from ordinary families to the rich become very large.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.520
And they have to balance somehow.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.440
And there's only really three ways

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.080
that those cash flows can be balanced.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.560
One is ordinary

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.760
people work much more for the rich,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.600
although in reality, if you try and do that,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
it tends to just push wages down.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.200
Two is ordinary families sell their assets to the rich,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.960
and that is why we are seeing reduced

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.080
homeownership rates and reduced ability

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.200
to save in pensions.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.960
But the third one is

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.680
the rich can lend that money back to the poor.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.880
And that is what we're seeing when we see

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.440
mortgage sizes increase.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.040
What you are seeing

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.200
there is the rich taking enormous

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
amounts of money from working families

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.920
and then lending it back.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.160
Okay, but up till now, that's

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.400
all been very theoretical.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.200
But I want to talk about how it works in practice.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.240
So let's take a practical example,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.800
which happened recently.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.040
So I speak a lot on the channel

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.160
about how during Covid, governments

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.920
gave out an enormous amount of money.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.760
And that money was largely,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.040
in the end, accumulated by richer people.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.440
If you want to understand how that worked,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.200
you can go and watch our first video on the channel

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.960
How The Rich Got Rich From Covid 19.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.280
When these rich people started to accumulate cash,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.120
what do they do?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.760
So rich people,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.840
they tend to want to own a balanced portfolio.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.120
What that means is

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.920
they want to own things like stocks and shares,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.400
but they also want to own things like bonds,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.520
because bonds pay a very regular interest

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.760
and they want to own things like gold.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.880
They want to own property as well.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.320
At first they'll go out and they'll...

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.840
they’ll buy the stuff that's easy to buy,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.920
stocks and shares these kinds of things.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.560
But eventually

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.680
they're going to want to diversify

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.040
and they're going to want to own property.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.400
But the problem with property is it's very difficult

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.000
for super rich people

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.520
to buy enormous amounts of property.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:18.920
So say,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.960
if you if you're very rich

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.840
and you suddenly receive an income of £10 million,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.920
you can quite easily buy £10 million of stocks.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.800
You can do it really at the drop of a hat.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.720
It's much harder to buy £10 million of property.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.560
If you were to buy

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.280
£10 million of property, you would then have to manage

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.960
these properties.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.280
You'd have to worry about tenants, worry about rent.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.480
You have to worry about people's boilers breaking.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.880
It's a hassle, basically.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.720
So what do rich people do?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.320
Well, let me give you an example.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:49.040
If I had £500,000 cash and I wanted to buy a property,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.680
I could go out and spend £500,000,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.200
buy a flat in London.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.960
£500,000 is kind of roughly

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.840
what a flat in London costs nowadays.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.000
I could rent it to my sister and she could pay me

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.320
rent every month.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.240
Alternatively, I could lend that money to my sister.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.440
She could go out and buy the house herself,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
and then she could pay me interest every month.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.280
How are these two things different to me?

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.040
Well, the first thing I want to point out is,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.440
what is the difference between those two examples

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.640
on the housing market and on house prices?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.560
The answer is that is exactly no difference.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.040
You know the housing market doesn't see whether it's me

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.120
or whether it's my sister,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.600
whether I'm buying directly

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.680
or whether I'm lending to my sister.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.120
All the housing market sees

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.040
is somebody’s coming in with £500,000

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.240
and buying a house.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.080
So what that shows you is

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.040
whether I buy the house directly

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.840
or whether I lend the money out to buy the house.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.120
In both cases, I drive the house price up.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.120
The second thing is this question of

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.640
who actually owns the house.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.320
So legally, technically, if

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.160
I lent the money to my sister,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.080
my sister owns the house.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.520
But what is her net worth after she buys it?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.160
Well, she buys a flat that's worth £500,000.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
She has debt of £500,000.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.400
She's worth nothing.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.720
So, essentially, I own the equity in the house.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.560
So what I'm trying to say here...

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.400
Oh, we should also look at cash flows, right?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.640
Given that interest rates now are about 5%,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.120
the amount of rent you would pay if you rented it is

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.520
probably not that dissimilar to the amount of interest

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.200
she would pay on borrowing that money.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.160
So really,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.120
whichever way you cut it

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.280
and there are some differences.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.720
Obviously if the house price goes up,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.080
I prefer to own the house.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.600
The house price goes down. I prefer to be the lender.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.760
But really

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.560
the point I'm trying to make here

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.920
is lending money for mortgages

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.840
is essentially a way for the rich to buy houses

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.680
via the middle class,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.360
and not have to worry about the house price movements,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.240
and not have to worry about managements.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.240
Mortgage lending

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.360
and the accumulation of credit by the rich

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.760
is the way in which rich people buy houses.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.320
And if you are sitting on a house

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.840
with an enormous mortgage,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.800
realistically you don't own that house.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.080
The person who lent you the money owns that house.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.440
And it's important to understand this

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.640
because as we go forward,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.080
this increased size of mortgage

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.560
is going to be the primary way

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.480
in which we see the wealth of the middle class decline,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.200
especially here in the UK.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.960
In the UK,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.360
ordinary people tend to hold their assets in property,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.960
and there is

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.440
and there will be less direct owning of property

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.920
by ordinary families.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.320
But what you will see increasingly, is

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.160
the government need to keep people

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.480
owning property politically.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.840
The rich have this enormous amount of cash,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.720
which is driving house prices up.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.160
The way that the government can square

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.560
that circle is to encourage

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.040
rich people to lend that money.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.360
And that money gets borrowed

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.720
eventually by ordinary people.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.960
And I think this gets disguised somewhat

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.040
by the fact that this lending tends

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.480
to go through the banking system.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.600
And I think a lot of people assume

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.680
that when mortgages go up,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.600
what that means is the bank is accumulating credit.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.560
But remember what I said

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.160
at the beginning of this video, that credit and debt

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.240
always equals in society.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.120
So we can go and we can look at any individual

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.360
and we can say how much credit do you have?

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.560
How much money do you have versus how much do you have?

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.120
And you can take the credit and the money.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
You can subtract off the debt

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.840
and we can work out your total money position.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.560
We can do that to any individual in society,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.840
any company in society.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.520
When we add it up,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.680
we know it's going to work out to zero.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.200
If you look at the banks,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.120
the banks do have an enormous amount of credit

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.720
because anyone who has a mortgage owes

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.920
money to the bank.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.880
But the bank has also an enormous amount of debt.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.560
And if you look at it,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.160
you'll find that the debts of banks,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.680
which is money they owe to depositors, money

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.280
they owe to lenders such as bondholders of the banks.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.600
These debts, in most cases,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.760
are pretty much the same as the total amount of credit

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760
they lend out.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.640
What this means is banks are essentially middlemen.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.320
They borrow money from the rich,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.800
they lend money to mortgages,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.920
and the mortgage interest goes from you,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.080
the mortgager, to the bank to the rich.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.520
These people are essentially just middlemen in between.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.200
So you need to understand this,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.880
because governments

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.760
will see the only way to keep ordinary people in houses

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.600
is to encourage

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.080
high levels of lending, high levels of mortgages, to

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.640
do things

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.800
like reduce the checks on mortgage eligibility,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.160
to encourage things like longer term

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.280
mortgages, to encourage things

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.880
like multi-generational mortgages.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.920
And this is exactly

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.960
the transfer of wealth

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.440
from the middle class to the rich.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.920
You are getting further and further into debt.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.240
The rich are getting further and further into credit.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.320
They are owning your house via your mortgage

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.520
and they are driving you into poverty.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.440
Yeah, I should be clear.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.440
I'm not saying don't take a mortgage.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.240
I'm not saying don't buy a house.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.320
Ordinary people,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.560
especially ordinary young people, are

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.400
put in a situation

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.480
where you either have to pay rent to the rich,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.000
or you have to pay interest to the rich.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.200
There's no way of getting out of that

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.560
unless your parents are rich

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.160
and they can let you live in their house.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.720
You can't really escape this system.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.520
Over time, house prices tend to go up,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.600
which means that financially,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.640
you probably are better off

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.280
borrowing as opposed to renting.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.080
But what this means is

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.640
your kids will have larger

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.200
and larger and larger mortgages.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.640
They will have larger and larger amounts of debt.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.560
You know, it's already normal for an ordinary person

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.320
that £500,000 of debt in a mortgage

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.280
that will become £1 million,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.760
that will become £2 million.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.840
And that means that your kids

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.880
and your grandkids will end up with mortgages

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.080
that they can never, ever, ever repay.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.960
And that will be debt owed to the rich,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.400
and it'll be interest paid to the rich.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.600
And they can use that interest

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.360
to push house prices up even further and out

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.080
compete your kids for the assets that they need.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.240
This will get worse and worse over time.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.520
That is the nature of compound interest.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.240
I want to be clear. I don't think banks are evil.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.400
I don't think lenders are evil.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.680
I don't think mortgages are evil.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.440
But increased mortgages are debt to somebody.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.680
They are debt to the rich, they will grow and grow.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.880
This increased debt is the main way

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880
in which we will see

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.480
ordinary families get poorer over time.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.560
The only way to fight it is to rebalance power.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.080
It's to increase tax on the rich.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.080
It is to decrease taxes on ordinary families.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.680
That's what we campaign for on this channel.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.600
Please support us.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.280
Tell your friends. Tell your mum. Good luck.
