00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.440 line:98%
I'm Gary Stevenson, former trader, peoples economist,
this is Gary's Economics

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.200 line:98%
Today we're gonna explain
What is wealth

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.840 line:98%
When I was a kid, all the money my
family made was from my dad's job

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.040 line:98%
when I got older and got a job myself in the city
all the money I made was from working myself

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.600 line:99%
most ordinary families are like this

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.480 line:98%
when they think about money, when they think
about wealth, its all work and job

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640 line:98%
but from working in the city what I
realised was, for very rich families

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.120 line:98%
things are different, for them its not
about work at all, its about wealth.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520 line:98%
Now wealth is not about what job
you do or how hard you work

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.480 line:99%
wealth is about what do you own

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.880 line:98%
now, i think for most of us
its so hard just to get a house

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.960 line:97%
that we dont really realise
how much wealth there is in society


00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.400 line:98%
its not just about houses and flats you know
I live here near Canary Wharf

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.960 line:98%
all of those big skyscrapers in the wharf
all of those big skyscrapers in the city

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.840 line:98%
they're owned as well
and its not just the skyscrapers right

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.960 line:98%
walk down the high street
the shopping centres - they're owned

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.280 line:98%
the banks, the restaurants, the pubs, the bars
- everything is owned

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.400 line:98%
OK you might be thinking
i don't know anyone who owns a skyscrapper

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920 line:99%
i dont know anyone who owns a shopping centre

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.480 line:98%
and the reason for that is; unlike houses
where a lot of ordinary people do own some

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.200 line:98%
all of this commercial wealth
this commercial property

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.280 line:98%
the vast majority of it is owned by the
richest individuals and families in our society

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.640 line:98%
So the point to make here is that theres a
huge amount of wealth that exists in the world

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 line:98%
and i want you to think about this
next time you walk down the high street

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.120 line:98%
look at all the shops, look at all the
restaurants, all the bars, all the pubs

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120 line:98%
and think to yourself
somebody owns this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.800 line:98%
all of the wealth that exists
is owned

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800 line:98%
But it actually goes deeper than that...


00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.800 line:98%
Because there are a lot of
things that ordinary people do own

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.000 line:98%
ordinary people often own their own house
or the flat that they live in

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.240 line:98%
but a lot of the time the only way they
are able to do that is through debt

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.600 line:99%
now debt is like negative weallth

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.760 line:98%
if you buy a flat for £200,000
and you borrow  £150,000

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.760 line:99%
you actually only really own 25% of that flat

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440 line:99%
that loan doesn't come from nowhere

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.560 line:98%
it comes from the bank and ultimately
the wealthy individuals who own that bank

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240 line:99%
so what that means is...

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.960 line:98%
even the things which we do own
like our houses and the flats that we live in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.440 line:99%
often even those things are indirectly owned

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.360 line:98%
by the wealthiest people in our country via
the debt that we had to take to buy them

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.040 line:98%
Now this isn't just true for ordinary people
and ordinary families

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320 line:99%
this is true for the government as well

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.120 line:98%
Now, when we're talking about the physical wealth
that exists in our cities and our country

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.800 line:98%
there are a lot of things that are owned by the government;
the schools, hospitals, police stations, fire stations

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.320 line:98%
but if we look at the data gathered
by French economist Thomas Piketty

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.680 line:98%
He estimates that government debt is worth more than all of the wealth:
all of the schools, all of the hospitals, owned by the government

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.040 line:98%
what that means is indirectly, via debt, the wealthy people
also own all of the schools and hospitals in this country

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.520 line:99%
But it actually goes deeper than that still...

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.040 line:98%
it's not just that the richest people
own all of the wealth in our society

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.280 line:98%
they actually make a huge amount
of money just from owning that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.000 line:98%
and that money doesn't come out of nowhere
it comes from people like you and me

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:98%
Now the most obvious example of that
is if you rent a house or rent a flat

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.320 line:98%
You work, if you work here in London,
probably end of the month

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.040 line:98%
a third of your pay goes straight toward paying the rent
and that goes to the owner of the house

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.560 line:98%
if you own your own property the same
things gonna happen with your mortgage

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.560 line:97%
The money doesnt disappear,
that money goes from you


00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.960 line:98%
to the person who owns the property
or the person who owns the mortgage

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.080 line:98%
which in most cases
will be a wealthy person

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.520 line:98%
OK but this isn't just the case for property
this happens every single time you spend money

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.200 line:98%
when you pay your bills, that money is going towards
the owners of the energy and gas companies

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.920 line:97%
and the owners of those natural resources
when you go to the supermarket to buy your groceries


00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.800 line:98%
that money doesn't all go to the workers in the supermarket
a big chunk of it goes towards the owner of the supermarket

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440 line:98%
and the owner of the building the supermarket is in
when you go to work in an office

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.520 line:98%
a big chunk of the money you make is going
towards the owners of the office building

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.720 line:98%
every single time you spend money
every single time you make money

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.960 line:98%
a big chunk of the money is going from
you to the owners of all that wealth

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.640 line:98%
Its easy for us not to think about this kind
of money that comes from owning wealth

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.760 line:98%
because for most of us we get
our money from working a job

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.480 line:98%
the richest people, they get most of their money from this
wealth income, income that comes from the things that they own

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.440 line:99%
and the size of it can be enormous

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.840 line:98%
for somebody who has a wealth of £2million
they can make an income of about £60,000 every year

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.880 line:98%
just from the wealth that they own, that is enough
to live a pretty good life for an ordinary family

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.720 line:98%
but very wealthy individuals can make a lot more
somebody who has £10million

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.840 line:98%
they will probably make, every single year, £300,000
just from the things they own, without having to get out of bed

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.840 line:98%
now once we start talking about super super rich people
if you have just £1billion, you will make every year

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.320 line:97%
£30 million - just for the wealth that you own. If we look at
Jeff Bezos who has an estimated wealth of 200 billion Dollars


00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.440 line:98%
this guy if he makes just a 3% return on his wealth
hes gonna make every single year 6 billion Dollars

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680 line:99%
6 Thousand Millions Dollars!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.880 line:98%
What i want you to be able to realise is
whilst we are out here working for our money

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.600 line:98%
these super rich people, they're making tens, hundreds,
even billions of pounds or dollars every single year

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.400 line:98%
without working at all. Just from
the money they earned from this wealth

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.880 line:98%
&amp; its important to realise like i have said,
that money is not coming from nowhere

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.680 line:99%
that money is coming from the money that you and I spend

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:18.360 line:98%
Recently the wealth of the richest people in our society
not just the top 1% but the top 0.1% or 0.01% - has exploded

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.800 line:98%
these guys get a massive amount of income every year
from their wealth - tens/hundreds of millions of pounds

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.840 line:98%
ordinary people like you and me they spend pretty much
all the money they make over the course of their life

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:41.400 line:97%
but im agine you're Jeff Bezos and hes making every single
year 6 billion Dollars (six thousand million dollars)


00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.080 line:98%
which is, i dunno, 20 million Dollars a day
or something, he cant spend all of that money

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.680 line:98%
this tells you something important about the difference
between ordinary people and the super rich

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.720 line:98%
ordinary people spend the money they make
whereas the super rich save the money they make

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.240 line:98%
so what does it mean if the super rich are getting richer
and richer and richer &amp; that money is coming from us

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.600 line:97%
well we would have spent it &amp; they're gonna save it
so if they're getting richer and richer and richer


00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.320 line:97%
they're taking more money out of the system
more and more and more money is being saved


00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:24.040 line:98%
in a strong economy thats not necessarily a bad thing, they can save
that money, invest it into growing businesses, the economy can grow

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.480 line:98%
but when we have a weak economy, like what
we've had definitely since 2008

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.720 line:98%
the companies dont wanna invest and they dont wanna grow
so it creates a problem right,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.600 line:98%
these super rich guys are making huge amounts
of money every year from their wealth

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:47.080 line:98%
and they cant invest it, so what are they gonna do?
well if they can't invest it, there is 1 other thing they can do

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.480 line:99%
They can buy your mum's house!

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.040 line:98%
so that is what happens in a weak economy
that is very unequal

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.840 line:98%
the rich own all of the wealth, that means they generate a massive
amount of cashflow from the rest of us every single year

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.240 line:97%
they can't invest it because the economy isn't growing
so instead they use that money to buy wealth from the rest of us


00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:16.400 line:98%
to buy our houses for example and that is why you're
seeing my generation (younger people) are unable to get houses

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.880 line:98%
when our parents generation were able to get them
Because we are gonna have to compete

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.880 line:98%
with the huge amounts of income from the super rich
who wanna buy the houses aswell

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.080 line:98%
thats why we've seen houses in this country go up from
2-3 times the average wage to 20-30 time

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.080 line:99%
but what does that mean is gonna happen?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.200 line:98%
if the rich are getting more and more income
and they're using it to buy our wealth

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.680 line:98%
well thats means next year the rich are gonna get even more income
from us which they're gonna use to buy even more of our wealth

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.200 line:98%
and the year after that they're gonna get even more income from
us which they're gonna use to buy even more of our wealth

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.880 line:98%
when i say wealth, i'm talking about things that we need
like houses we need to raise our families

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.880 line:98%
what happens is, is you enter a really negative spiral
where the working people give all their income every year to the rich

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.320 line:98%
and the rich use that income to buy
the wealth from the working people

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.040 line:98%
which means the rich get richer and richer
and ordinary people get poorer and poorer

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.320 line:98%
I'm not just saying that this is gonna happen
I've been betting on this for over 10 years now

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.680 line:98%
and i've been right for 10 years
I've made millions of pounds betting on this...

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.920 line:98%
and it's gonna happen
it's happening right now

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.080 line:98%
So that's really important to understand
Income is about work

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.800 line:98%
whereas wealth is about ownership of things
the ownership is super super unequal-

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.920 line:98%
the rich own almost all of the wealth in society
that means a huge amount of money

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.320 line:98%
gets transferred from ordinary working
people to the rich every year

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.640 line:98%
they use that money to buy our stuff
that makes us poorer

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.640 line:98%
this cycle is gonna get worse and worse and worse unless
we do something about it, so what do we have to do?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.520 line:98%
the big problem here is that the money that
you and me make from working gets taxed differently

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.000 line:99%
to the money that the super rich make from their wealth

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.600 line:98%
our money when we work it gets taxed at source
we have to pay that tax

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.080 line:97%
but rich people they get their money in different ways
capital gains, inheritances, trusts...


00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.920 line:98%
these methods of getting income, income you get from wealth
its much much easier to avoid taxes

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.000 line:99%
when you get your income in that way

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:32.160 line:98%
if we allow that to happen it is inevitable that more and more wealth
is gonna get transferred from workers to these super rich families

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.080 line:98%
that is gonna mean that ordinary workers in the future
are not gonna be able to afford houses

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.360 line:98%
and if you go and look at the really unequal places
in the world, look at Mumbai, look at Hong Kong

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.840 line:98%
or go look at what England was like a 100 years ago
and it was much more unequal

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.680 line:98%
in those spaces ordinary working people,
working families can't buy houses

00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.280 line:98%
unless we do something about this inequality, unless we make sure
the super rich at least pay the same rate of tax that the rest of us pay

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:08.560 line:98%
that is our future, our future's gonna be a space where
all of our money goes on just paying for the basics of life

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.520 line:98%
and we can never own houses
and the super rich... own houses

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.520 line:98%
what that means is if you were born poor you will die poor
and if you were born rich you will die richer

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.040 line:98%
for me, that's not the kind of future i wanna live in
so that's why i am making these videos

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.520 line:98%
my ultimate message is we need to find a way to make sure
the super richest start contributing back to society

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.360 line:98%
So look, thats the message of this video - it's super important
to understand the difference between wealth and income

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.640 line:98%
and money people make from working vs money that
super rich families make just from owning all the stuff

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.200 line:98%
You know when i go out there and
talk about we need to tax the rich more

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.760 line:97%
people sometimes ask me what is rich?
is it someone who makes £80,000 a year?


00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.600 line:98%
is it someone who makes £100,000 a year?
This shows...

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.000 line:98%
a lack of understanding on the
difference between wealth and income

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.880 line:98%
because i'm not talking about taxing working people, what i want
is for working people to be able to make money and buy houses

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.960 line:98%
but we need to make sure we tax the super rich families
who are making massive amounts of income from us

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.800 line:99%
and using that to buy our houses

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.600 line:98%
if we don't do that houses are not gonna be affordable for working people
houses are not gonna be affordable for future generations

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.280 line:98%
and that will mean future generations cannot
get financial security to raise a family

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.400 line:98%
so we need to look beyond just taxing working people
and start looking at taxing the super rich families

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.080 line:98%
who might have a £100million
or like Rishi Sunak's family over a £1billion

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.160 line:98%
because they're generating a huge amount of income
every year and they are not paying their bit

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.240 line:98%
instead they're using that money to push up
house prices - which is affecting our future

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.600 line:98%
If you wanna know what you can do to help make this happen
we are gonna talk about that more in the next video

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.840 line:97%
