00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Okay.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
Today, we're going to predict the next election, and

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.560
we are going to answer the question, will Reform win?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.920
Okay.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.480
So whenever I want to make a prediction about politics,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840
the first thing I always do is I check the odds.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.040
The betting odds are not always right, but I think it's

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.360
always a good idea to look at what the market thinks

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.280
and then compare it to what you think, and see

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.040
if you can understand what the difference might be.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.600
So I look at these odds a lot.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.160
Obviously, I used to be a trader.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.120
I'm looking at the markets a lot.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.280
But I also do, now I'm interested in politics,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.720
look at the betting markets for politics a lot.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.440
So we're going to flash these up here.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.880
I go to Betfair, and I look at the market.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.320
It's a little bit difficult to

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.800
translate, so I'll do it for you.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.600
This here shows the betting market for who will

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960
get the most seats at the next UK election.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.400
These two red and blue numbers,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.000
they show, a range of probabilities.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.520
And if you divide one by the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.240
number, you get the probability.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.800
I'll do the maths for you.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800
What this says is that Reform have almost exactly 50%

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.480
chance of getting the most seats at the next election,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.360
and Labour have... That's probably going to be something

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.040
like about 32% chance of getting the most seats.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.680
And then you've got the Conservatives

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.840
down at... That's going to be about 12%.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.280
And then there's about a 2% chance for the Lib

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.720
Dems and a little bit for a few other parties.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.960
So basically, the betting market thinks

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.240
that Reform have almost exactly 50% chance of

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.200
getting the most seats at the next election.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.760
And that probability has been steadily climbing,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.040
really, over the past few months I've been following it.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.760
Does that mean Reform will win the next election?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.840
Now, this is a little bit more

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.240
complicated because in the UK we now have a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.080
multi-party system, which is kind of amazing.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.560
We've never really had one before.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.400
Because the main two historic parties, Labour

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.960
and Conservatives, are very unpopular now, we're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.680
going to get a situation in the next election

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.720
where really a lot of parties get a lot of seats.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200
Most seats will go to Reform and Labour, but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.240
the Conservatives will probably still get a few.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
The Liberal Democrats will get

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.280
a big chunk like they did last election.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.840
And I think the Greens will also get

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560
a decent chunk for the first time ever.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.840
And I think because Labour will be unpopular,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.440
the SNP, the Scottish National Party in

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680
Scotland, will get a lot of seats as well.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
Now, the betting market thinks... We can

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.640
also ask the betting market whether it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.320
thinks anyone will get an overall majority.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.800
So the way it works in this country

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.080
is they'll get a number of seats.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.440
Historically, the winning party almost always gets

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920
a majority, which means more than 50% of the seats.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.720
But because in the next election the vote

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.160
will be so divided, there's a good chance that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.120
whoever wins, be it Reform or Labour, who it will

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.960
almost certainly be one of those two parties,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.800
neither one will get an overall majority.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.680
So we can also look at the betting market here for

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.520
overall majority, and what you see is that the chance

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.840
of there being a majority is... They reckon there's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.960
about a 52% chance that we'll have what we call a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.520
hung parliament, which means no one has a majority.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.400
So there's a good chance, according to the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.400
betting market, Reform will get the most seats,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.360
but they will not get enough seats to get a majority.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.120
Which then means there's the possibility

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.240
for, like, coalitions, and you could end up

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.560
with this really complicated situation where

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.320
Reform have more seats, but you would imagine, because

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.480
Reform are quite unpopular other than with Reform

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.440
voters, that the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.120
the Scottish National Party might support Labour.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.400
Which might give them more seats than Reform, but

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.320
then the Conservatives, will they support Reform?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.720
Maybe they will, maybe they won't.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.640
So you could end up in this really complicated, like,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.080
split situation where Reform have the most seats, but as

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.600
a coalition, Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the Greens,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.560
have more, and then what will the Conservatives do?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.480
And it could be phenomenally complicated, really.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.560
So basically, when we look at the betting

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.080
market, what the betting market tells us is

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.080
it's 50/50 Reform will get the most seats, but we

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.600
don't know whether that will be enough for them to

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.160
get a majority or to form a government.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.440
Okay.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.800
But that is the betting market.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.600
And obviously, as you know, because I talk about

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.840
it a lot, I was a former trader, and I was a

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.480
very successful trader, and I still do trade now.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.200
When I look at the odds for anything, financial

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.760
market, betting market, I'm always asking myself,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.440
"What do I know that the betting market doesn't know?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.840
Could the betting market be wrong?" And I've got

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.160
a pretty good track record recently of correctly

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.480
predicting politics based really on just one

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.160
thing which I know, which political

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
forecasters generally don't know, which is

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.400
that the economy and the economic situation and

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.440
living standards are going to keep getting worse.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.520
This is based on the very simple understanding,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.120
which I speak about a lot on this channel,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.520
which is that falling living standards are

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880
linked to rapidly growing wealth inequality.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.600
Our political leaders are not doing

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.840
anything about growing wealth inequality, which

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.160
means that inequality will continue to grow

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.520
and living standards will continue to fall.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.960
Understanding that is basically why I was able to

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.120
predict the failure of Rishi Sunak, the failure

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.240
of Keir Starmer, and the rising popularity of Reform.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.160
That will keep happening.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.840
Living standards will keep falling, which means that

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.960
by the time we get to the next election, and the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.200
next election here in this country is not due until

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.000
2029... By the time we get to the next election,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.520
living standards will be even worse than they are now.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.560
The economic situation will be worse, and this will

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.080
be basically devastating for the popularity of Labour.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.560
And this is why I think you've seen

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.120
Reform's odds rising and rising and rising.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.880
That is basically because the longer Labour are in

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.160
power, whilst they do nothing about inequality, it is

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
basically inevitable that living standards will fall,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.200
their popularity will fall and that will increase

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.240
Reform's leads in polling, and that will increase

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.840
the Reform's likelihood of winning the next election.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.440
So I think because the economic worsening is not

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.320
baked into these statistics, I think Reform's chances

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.640
of winning the next election are significantly

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.080
higher than the betting market thinks of 50%.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.120
One other thing I should add to that is

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.880
when you... If we look historically, this economic

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.400
worsening is going to make Labour more unpopular, but

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.200
there is a really strong historical trend of at times

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.440
of economic weakness, especially prolonged economic

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.480
weakness, really strong demand from the public for the

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.880
far right, and also for leaders who give a sense

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.760
of strength, strong-seeming leaders, especially

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.120
leaders who are sort of strong and on our side.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.760
And that is very much the vibe that Farage is going for.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.880
And at the moment, none of the other parties,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.240
none of the other main parties, Conservatives

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.480
or Labour, have really been able to do that.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.600
So as the economy weakens, really further

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.400
economic weakness is terrible for

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.280
Labour and it's just great for Reform.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.400
So I think they have much better chance

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.840
than the betting market suggests.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.760
So as that happens, as time passes, Reform's...

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.400
Unless Reform do something crazy or there's

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.520
some massive scandal, which is definitely

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.080
possible because I think there are some

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.480
perhaps slightly rogue guys in their party.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.920
If that doesn't happen, I think Reform's

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.720
odds will go up and up and up and up and up.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.320
And then that will force the other parties to react.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.280
Because as time passes, it will become more

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.960
and more obvious that Labour are going to lose.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.800
The Conservatives are already in a very weak place.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.960
And as it becomes clear they're losing,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.600
they will have to move.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
So what will they do?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.960
So Labour... Labour are in interesting situation.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.280
They have a budget coming up in November.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.240
Their economic situation is terrible.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.600
They're probably going to significantly

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.880
raise taxes in the autumn.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.200
They're not going to go for popular taxes

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.200
like the wealth tax, like taxes we support.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.280
They're probably going

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.560
to go on taxes on the middle class.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.320
They might go on taxes on working people.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.480
I think it's going to be very difficult for them

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.880
to do that and not take a big hit in popularity.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.200
Then in May, we will have local elections,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.920
Including here in London, and I

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920
think they will do really, really badly.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.640
So I think that Labour are... Firstly,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.480
they're already polling really badly.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.200
Keir Starmer, the leader, polls really badly.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.800
And they're about to go into two like really bad

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.160
events basically, a really bad autumn budget

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.840
in November, and a really bad election in May.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.680
So, basically, Labour are in a really

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.560
bad situation, which is about to worsen.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.240
And what that means is the same thing that

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.920
I've said for a long time, because I've

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.680
always predicted this would happen to Labour.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.160
Keir Starmer's popularity will collapse.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.960
Labour's popularity will collapse, and Labour

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.240
will be forced into a massive rebrand,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240
which is going to change the leadership.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.560
And we can actually look at this

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.880
in the betting markets as well.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.120
So, if we flash it up, you can look at the betting

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.320
market, when will Keir Starmer leave?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.560
And if you look at it now, at this point, it thinks that

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.400
Keir Starmer will be lucky if he survives next year.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.040
And I think that there is a good

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.120
chance that Keir Starmer will go next year.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.320
We don't know for sure it'll be next year.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.120
The betting market here reckons the chance of him

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.400
surviving to the next election are about something

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.400
like 16%, which is obviously very, very low.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.320
So, we can't say for certain,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.760
but I think I'm pretty confident.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.800
Keir Starmer will go, Keir Starmer will

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.920
be replaced, and there'll be a new leader.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.320
Now this... And again, I've said it for even since

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.480
before Labour came in that this is what would happen.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.040
This is a massive opportunity for us because there

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.720
will be a new Labour leader probably next year.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240
We don't know exactly when.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.560
And when that leader comes in, he or she will

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.880
have to come in with some kind of brand, some

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.840
kind of message, some kind of story, right?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.320
They will have to say, "I am Mr. or Mrs. X.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.560
I stand for Y.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.360
My plan for the future of this country is

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.840
Z." And in particular, because the economy

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.440
continues to worsen, they will have to have a

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.280
very clear vision and a very clear picture on

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.400
what they were going to do for the economy.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.560
And when they come in, they will have to look around

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.560
at all the different ideas about how we should

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.880
manage the economy, and they will have to pick one.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.320
And they say, "This is going to

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.320
be the brand which identifies me.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.280
This is the kind of economic leader I am.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.760
This is the kind of economic future I want for

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.800
the country." And this is going to be a massive,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.320
massive opportunity for me, for us, for this

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.120
channel, because I think personally, if you are

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.680
a new Labour leader coming in now, and you want to

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.080
win the election, the best economic strategy for

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.000
you to pick is wealth taxes, is inequality,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.400
Because really, this is the simple

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.800
question, is, "What the **** else is there?"

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.760
I don't think you can go running on what Labour

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.520
and what Keir Starmer have been running on up

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.000
till now, which is just, "We are really sensible.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.920
We're going to try and sensible our way out of this.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.320
We're going to try and grow, grow, grow

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.720
our way out of this." Because it's really

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.440
clear that that is the existing status quo.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.640
That's what governments have tried to do for 20 years.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.760
It hasn't worked.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.800
It's not working.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.480
It's not working for Keir Starmer.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.000
So they have to do something new.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.040
We have to basically position ourselves

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.920
that when the new Labour leader comes in, they look

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.400
around the world of economic ideas, and they say,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.920
"The one that is going to win us the next election

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.280
is inequality, is wealth taxes, is that stuff

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.920
supported by Garys Economics and Gabriel Zucman and

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.040
Patriotic Millionaires." We have to be that voice.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.280
It's a massive opportunity for us.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.080
If they choose that, I think they can win the

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.960
next election, which means I think Reform will

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.800
lose the next election. Will they choose it?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.160
So I think it's an obvious choice

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.680
I think it's an obvious choice if they want to win.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.840
I don't think Labour are great, so

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.880
they might not make the right choice.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.800
There's a couple of other choices they can make.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.680
The other choice is to kind of double down on this

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.880
Mr. Sensible, Keir Starmer sensible Labour stuff.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.720
Grow, grow, grow.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.600
It sounds great.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.480
It's... If you're a very boring person, it's...

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480
I don't think it's going to win the public.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.800
It hasn't worked for Keir Starmer.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.440
It didn't work for Biden and Kamala.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.960
It will be very unoriginal, it will be very uninspiring.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.560
I think you're handing the

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.120
battle over to the right.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.720
There is another choice they can make, which I think

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.280
is a good chance the choice that they will make, which

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.280
is to come in very anti-immigration, and that is because

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.680
at the moment, the big salience is on immigration.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.600
They're worried about Reform, and they could say,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.480
"Okay, well, we are going to go on the issue which

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.720
everybody's talking about, which is immigration." If

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.480
they do this, it brings up the issues that I spoke about

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.040
in the video from two weeks ago about storytelling and

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.760
salience and wedge issues, which is immigration is the

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.280
issue upon which Labour is weak and Reform is strong.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.040
So if Labour chooses to make immigration its defining

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.320
economic policy, it's basically signing its own death

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.320
warrant because it basically guarantees that the entire

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.640
economic debate between the new leadership coming in

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.920
and the election will constantly be the issue about

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.840
which Labour is weak and Reform are strong.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.160
So, basically, I think when the new Labour leader

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.840
comes in, he's going to have three choices.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.000
Either move... try and shift salience towards

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.520
inequality, distribution, which is the

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.640
issue on, on which Labour is strong.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.720
Well, it could try to become strong.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.960
We are strong, and if they try to use our voice,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.040
they could become strong and Reform is weak.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.840
Or it can continue on its sort of nothing, nothing

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.000
boring path, which I think is a death warrant.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.480
Or it can choose to aggressively raise the

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.920
salience upon which its opponent is strong,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.680
which I think is a failure as well.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.200
If they come to us, I think they can win.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.240
I hope they will.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.360
I'm going to try everything to make sure that they do

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.200
That's going to be our main

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.040
priority, here on this channel.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.720
Unfortunately, I think they probably

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.280
won't, which means I think they'll probably

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.000
end up choosing the immigration option, which

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.880
means Reform will win the next election.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.840
Okay, so next is the Conservatives.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.880
So the Conservatives are still in there with a chance.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.160
The betting market does think they have a 12% chance

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.320
of winning the next election, getting the most seats.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.480
Which is interesting, right?

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.440
Because it's not zero.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.560
And at the moment, like there's a

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.360
lot of talk "Conservatives are dead."

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.280
Their leader is also unpopular despite

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.920
the Prime Minister's unpopularity.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.920
They're basically having their space aggressively

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.920
usurped by Reform, and it looks like the

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.960
party basically is at risk of disappearing.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.520
So why have they got the 12%?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.800
Okay, Reform... Conservatives also... Again,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.240
we can look in the betting market and we can see

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.920
betting market thinks the Conservatives will almost

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.600
certainly change their leader as well next year.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.920
So we can see here that the... Kemi Badenoch

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.920
also less than 50% chance of surviving next year.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.080
They'll bring a new leader in.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.840
It looks like it will be probably Robert Jenrick.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.880
We're not sure.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.160
There's this interesting thing that happens in games,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.960
which is when you are losing a game, especially

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.040
when you are losing a game quite aggressively,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.560
being kind of crazy becomes an optimal strategy.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.200
And the reason for that is probably best understood

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.640
by looking at it from the flipped perspective,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.240
which is imagine I'm comfortably winning a game.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.440
I know as long as nothing crazy happens,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.640
the game will be predictable and I will win.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.560
So people who are winning want

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.440
predictability, which means what people

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.880
who are losing want is unpredictability.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.560
And I think as we get closer and closer to that

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.480
election, at the moment the Conservatives are

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.640
kind of biding their time, thinking about the new

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.800
leader, hoping that Reform do something crazy,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.440
**** it up somehow, get like a big scandal.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.520
And then Robert Jenrick is going to come in,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.600
basically again, very hard on immigration

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.120
and hope that they can take the place

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.640
that Reform lose by sort of ******* it up.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.400
If Reform don't **** it up, as we get closer to the

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.600
election, the Conservatives will be more and more in

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.280
a situation where they have to do something crazy and

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.560
really I'm kind of interested to see what they do.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.800
You will probably see more and more and more kind

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.480
of wild and erratic behavior from the Conservatives

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.920
as we approach the election because they are

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.440
kind of facing basically an existential threat.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.200
There's a good chance that

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.760
they will disappear as a party.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.520
And that 12% is basically the 12% chance of, will

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.080
the Tories do something crazy which is somehow popular.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.200
I think it's unlikely, but we'll see.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.520
There's a couple of other parties

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.440
that I should mention, right?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.280
Which is the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.040
If I'm honest, I think the Liberal

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.400
Democrat situation is relatively uninteresting.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.440
The Liberal Democrats are... I

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.360
don't dislike the Liberal Democrats.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.640
The Liberal Democrats are an interesting

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.320
party because they compete not exclusively,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.120
but almost exclusively with the Conservatives.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.240
And that is because their voters are largely richer

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.320
people who would otherwise vote for Conservatives.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.560
Because the Conservatives did so badly in the last

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.440
election, the Liberal Democrats won like almost all of

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.320
their seats that they compete with the Conservatives.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.000
I think they'll probably just do that again.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.160
The big space really at the moment is who fills

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.080
the space that has been basically vacated by

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.200
the enormous decrease in popularity of Labour.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.000
And that is where the Greens are quite interesting,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.600
which is the Greens now have this new leader, Zach

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.520
Polanski, who is making like, quite a conscious pitch,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.680
which is I'm going to fill that space vacated by Labour.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.440
Labour have been sort of moving slowly

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.760
right as they sort of try and chase Reform.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.160
Their popularity has collapsed.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.520
And then there's this space which comes up for like,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.160
"Well, we are going to be a party which is like broadly

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.840
left." And I've constantly said I think that

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.600
there's really a space for a popular party which

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.280
focuses the economy, focuses inequality, focuses

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.360
wealth tax, and also aggressively focuses on social

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.360
media where there's a lot of political power.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.120
And this new guy, Zack Polansky in the Greens, seems to

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.160
be... It almost feels like he's just been watching this

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.000
channel and he's like, "Yeah, that's a good policy.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.160
I'm going to do that." So it's... I think the Greens

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.440
have the potential to take a huge amount of seats.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.000
Because of the massive unpopularity of Labour,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.680
they're like an obvious guys who could fill that gap.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.200
The new leader, Zack Polansky, talks about

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.440
30 to 40 seats, which would be enormous for

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.240
the Greens, who have never had more than four

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.080
seats, which is what they won last election.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.920
It's optimistic, but I think it's possible

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.560
for the reason that I highlighted before,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.760
which is Labour's popularity is going to tank.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.520
The risk to the Greens is basically the thing that

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.600
we want, which is if the Greens manage to get popularity

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.040
on this idea of basically wealth taxes on inequality,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.760
the new leader of Labour might try to usurp that

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.200
space, in which case it would really smash the Greens.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.560
But I mean, if what you want is wealth taxes

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.040
on inequality, then what you kind of really want

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.720
is for the Greens to do this interesting thing

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.640
where they push a policy with the hope that Labour

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.080
adopt it, which would lead to the Greens losing.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.720
It's this really interesting situation the Greens are

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.600
in, which is the best thing they can do for the country

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.480
is kind of intentionally lose, because they want to

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.440
drag Labour back into a kind of sensible policy space.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.640
And this is... What I think is really interesting here

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.440
is that the Greens are now in the kind of situation

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.600
that Nigel Farage was in for, like, the last 20 years.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.800
So, Nigel Farage, some people might not know,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.840
he's the leader of the Reform Party, and before

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.600
Reform, he was leader of a party called UKIP.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.720
And he only won his first seat

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.240
in Parliament last year, in 2024.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.040
But despite that, Nigel Farage is almost

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.160
single-handedly the man responsible for Brexit.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.960
And what that means, it's because he has been

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.360
doing basically exactly what I suggested the

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.200
Greens need to do, which is... He's constantly

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.840
been forcing the Conservatives to come towards

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.640
his direction without ever winning any seats.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.840
Because he can keep saying, "Well, I'm going to win

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.040
4 million, 5 million votes, and you're going to lose

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.800
the election unless you come across." And I think

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.320
Farage shows what I would like, sort of, the Greens

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.560
and Green supporters to realise, which is, under our

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.320
kind of stupid political system, where every election

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.040
is an election where only two parties can't win,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.360
as a smaller party, it is impossible for you to win.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.960
But it is possible for you to dominate the political

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.800
narrative by influencing the main political parties.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.280
And this brings us to... brings me to the next point I

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.080
want to make, which is, I think the only way, really,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.440
that I can see Reform not winning this election

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.160
is either Labour come across under their new leadership

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.320
and they adopt inequality as

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.240
their policy message, or the Greens are

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.520
so successful that they bring Labour across.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.080
And the truth is, I don't think either of

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.440
those things are likely to happen, which

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.040
means, that I basically think Reform are

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.560
probably going to win the next election.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.360
But if you do want it to happen...

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.760
Because I know that a lot of my viewers will

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.840
probably not want Reform to win the next election.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.560
If you do want that to happen, if you want

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.480
Reform not to win the next election, what do you do?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.680
So I was speaking to my brother this week,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.200
and he... he doesn't like me mentioning him

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.400
on the channel, so probably won't be happy.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.040
But he said something.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.040
He's an interesting guy, my brother.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.720
He said something interesting,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.760
which I was speaking to him about.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.120
You know, "Do you think Reform will win the next

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.400
election?" And he agreed with me and said, "Probably

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.280
yes." And I was like, "Do think there's any way

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.840
that Reform could be stopped?" And he just said one

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.400
line, which was, "Aggressive and relentless pursuit

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.880
of unity and common ground." That's all that he said

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.800
This is the kind of thing that he says.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.160
And in a sense, that's what I've just

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.120
said, which is basically unless the Greens

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.520
and Labour, the party on the left and the party of

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.240
the centre, both move into this space of focus

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.520
on the economy, focus on inequality, deal with

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.320
taxation, then Reform will win the election.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.440
And at this point, I should probably also

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.640
mention there is obviously a third party.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.560
There's the, the new party, which doesn't have a name

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.800
yet, which is led by Corbyn and Sultana, which...

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.800
They're behind wealth taxes as well, right.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.480
These guys have also popped up.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.000
The truth is we are going into the next election,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.680
Reform will be strong favorites.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.920
And really, whether Reform win or not will be decided

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.560
by whether these different groups of people, these

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.400
different groups of voters are able to do,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.600
as my brother said... He's going to hate

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.480
me from keeping on mentioning him.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.400
Aggressive and relentless pursuit

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.640
of unity and common ground.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.560
It's as simple as that, basically.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.440
We have, especially in this country, a political

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.360
system which aggressively punishes division.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.080
Aggressively, aggressively punishes division.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.440
What will probably happen in the next election

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.680
is that Reform will win an overall majority

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.640
with the smallest ever number of votes that

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.520
any party has ever won an overall majority.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.000
And that will be simply because

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.720
the people and the politicians in this

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.840
country who do not support Reform are divided.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.720
We have a political system, first past the post,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.640
which as an aside, I think is a stupid political system.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.640
Maybe I'll talk a video about it one time.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.920
That voting system, that political system aggressively,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.880
aggressively, aggressively punishes division.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.320
So whether Reform win or not is basically a

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.640
question of will the centre and will the left

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.120
be able to be aggressive and relentless

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.360
in their pursuit of common ground?

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.440
And, I would love for them to unite on the issues

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.560
which they have in common, which I would like to

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.640
believe are fixing the economy...... dealing with

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.480
inequality, dealing with an unfair taxation system.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.080
In reality, I don't think these various

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.600
groups are going to be able to do that.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.800
And unfortunately, that's just simply because

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.880
there's a lot of bad blood and a lot of antipathy

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.280
between the centre and the left,

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.920
and that goes in both directions.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.920
If they are able to be sensible, get their heads

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.600
together, focus on the message that will win,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.200
which is inequality, distribution, the economy,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.000
focus aggressively on their common ground, try

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.640
to avoid bickering and raising the salience

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.520
of their differences, try to avoid raising the

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.480
salience of their opponents, then they can win.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.240
If they're divided, they will lose.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.040
Okay, so that's my prediction.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.440
I do think Reform will win the next election.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.560
I think that will be clearer as time goes on.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.240
Really, the big dice that is yet to roll

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.040
is Labour's rebrand and Labour's new leadership.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.640
And in particular, what they

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.160
choose as their economic message.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.320
I've been talking to Labour.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.360
I'm not that popular.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.840
I'm... They're not

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.920
that popular with me either.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.000
I don't think that much of them, but I say that.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.280
Like, I want them to win because I think we have a

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.120
much better chance of getting wealth taxes with them

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.480
much better chance of getting wealth taxes with them

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.800
than with Reform, but I don't think that they will.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.320
I think they will...

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.680
I think they'll kind of **** it up.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.160
I think they'll probably choose migration.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.920
I think they'll end up

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.600
just boosting the salience of their opponents.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.120
And I think Reform and Farage

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.160
will win the next election.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.840
So, what do we think about that?

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.440
Now, this is quite difficult to talk about, right?

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.400
Because I try really, really hard on

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.560
this channel to be non-politically partisan.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.520
I am a single-issue channel.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.800
I'm an economist.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.640
I think the issue is inequality, and it's

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.560
about wealth taxes, so how do we do that?

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.640
And I try my best and I genuinely want this

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.560
channel to be watched by people on all sides of the

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.080
political spectrum, including Reform voters.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.480
And the country is becoming so divided at the moment

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.720
between people who like Farage and Reform and people

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.200
who don't, that it's very difficult to send a message

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.040
that will reach and be listened to all my viewers.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.280
Because I know we're listened to

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.160
by people who are on both sides of this.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.760
So, I'm going to send... I'm going to try to split

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.560
my message up into basically two parts.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.960
One for people who don't want Reform to win and

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.960
then one for people who are maybe supporting Reform.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.800
Okay, so if you don't want Farage to win, and again

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.120
we're going to have to split this message up now between

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.960
the people in the centre, people who might...

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.000
if you want to know who's on the centre, it's, you know.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.200
Do you like Keir Starmer?

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.640
Do you like the current Labour Party?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.920
Do you like Tony Blair?

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.120
You know, these kind of people

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.320
who like that kind of status quo.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.480
What do we want to say to them?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.520
And then we're going to talk to people

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.240
on the left, so people who might like

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.640
Zach Polanski, might like Jeremy Corbyn.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.360
What do we... What are the

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.880
risks to both of these groups?

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.360
Okay.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.280
If you're on the centre, and you

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.240
want... Presumably you want Labour to win.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.480
The way that you will lose this next election

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.080
is by either persisting with a status quo

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.920
economic policy which has no salience, no cut

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.160
through, no narrative, or by moving aggressively

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.560
towards constantly talking about immigration and

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.160
aggressively raising the salience of your opponents.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.040
You need a message which is

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.680
different from Reform's message.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.240
If your message is Reform's message,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.200
Reform will win the next election.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.000
So, that's it.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.400
You need your own message.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.200
You need your own voice.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.400
You need something that's popular.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.840
And I'm building it for you here.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.320
If you want to win the next election and

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.880
you're on the centre, you don't need to

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.800
change your opinions on everything, but you

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.000
do need to be open to doing something on

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.640
inequality, on wealth taxes, on the economy.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.040
You want to be saying, "We're going to raise

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.920
taxes on the super rich so that we can cut tax

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.400
on workers." That will boost your economy.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.320
That will make you popular.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.160
That is how you win.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.840
That is how you win.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.680
And I want you to be really, really mindful

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.840
of that when you're thinking about who is the

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.440
next Labour leader and what should he support?

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.080
Now, if you're on the left, I think the real risk

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.520
to the left at this point is with the real growth,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.920
the aggressive growth in the popularity

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.000
of Farage and Reform and things like the march

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.520
which happened last weekend, I think there is a

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.320
risk that the left gets very, very angry and starts

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.720
to be really, really aggressive and accusatory

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.560
towards people who might be voting for Reform.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560
I want to show you a clip which I

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.160
saw on PoliticsJOE the other weekend.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.320
So, let's run it.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.000
This is PoliticsJOE, talking to some

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.920
Reform, you know, passionate supporters,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.160
people who've gone to the conference.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.560
Let's see what they're saying.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.880
Wealth tax or no wealth tax?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.680
It's a very hard one.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.560
I mean, I come from a working class town.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.760
Everything in kind of Reform's policies would

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.280
maybe leaning more towards no wealth tax.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.760
So, for me, if the wealth tax was possible, I'm at a

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.400
stage in my politics where I would actually support it.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.560
There are a lot of Reform voters

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.280
who'd be supportive of wealth taxes.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.640
I know that a lot of people are scared of

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.720
the growth of Reform, and the truth is, I

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.520
am scared of the growth of Reform as well.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.680
I know that a lot of people who watch this channel

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.520
who see themselves as from the left are probably

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.160
people who are very interested in politics,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.720
people who are very knowledgeable about politics.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.600
Just the very fact that you're here watching

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.440
this video means you are probably somebody who is

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.720
interested in and knowledgeable about politics.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.040
I would like you to understand that the vast majority

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.080
of people in this country are not experts in politics.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.720
They read very little about politics.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.600
They have not spent loads and loads

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.840
of time thinking and researching politics.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.120
And they get their information from

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.040
the media or from social media.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.840
And what they have been told and are being told

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.000
consistently in the media is that the reason you are

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.960
poor, the reason your kids can't get a house, the

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.000
reason you can't get a job is because of immigration

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.920
or because of illegal immigration, because of refugees.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920
That's what they're being told.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.440
They're being told that again and

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.200
again and again and again and again.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.040
So, this is where they are.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.680
This is what they think.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.760
This is what they're being told.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.560
They think that the reason they're

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.200
being poor is because of immigration.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.640
And if they go to a protest or, you

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.720
know, they speak online about this and

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200
somebody gets in their face and calls them

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.280
a racist, that's not going to win them over.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.200
You are not going to win

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.320
these people over like that.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.240
I totally understand the instinct of people on the

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.200
left to worry about increasing racism in society.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.280
I think it's happening.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.600
I can feel it happening. You need to

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.840
be pragmatic, you need to be sensible.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.440
If you want to get progressive change in the next

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.200
election, you need to win people over, and I think

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.720
you need to be really careful to resist the temptation

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.920
to go around shouting at people, calling them racists.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.720
Listen, there are racists in this country.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.560
There always have been racists in this country.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.280
There's always been 100,000, 200,000 people who vote

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.760
for the BNP and might have been voted by racism.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.720
Might have been... Sorry, motivated by racism.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.280
Reform are going to win the next election,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.560
and you are not going to stop that by

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.400
turning around and calling people racists.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.960
What you need to do... And I know this might not be

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.880
pleasant for some of you... I think my brother's right.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.640
You need to be relentless and aggressive in your

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.080
pursuit of common ground and unity, and that means

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.240
you're willing to go to people who you might not

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.880
agree with everything about and say, "Listen, I

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.960
know we don't agree on everything, but let's find

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.800
the thing that we do agree on, and let's fight

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.040
for that." Because those people at those protests,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.880
they, just like you, are struggling to pay the rent.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.480
Their kids are struggling to pay the rent.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.240
They're struggling to find economic futures.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.520
If you centre that, if you focus on

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.160
that, you can build something positive.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.040
You can win them over.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.280
If you focus on what divides you, all you're going

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.280
to do is make this country more and more divided.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.680
So that, that's it, you know.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.200
I think really, in politics,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.480
as in history, division loses.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.200
I think you can afford to find your differences

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.480
and fight over them when you are winning.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.000
If you are losing, you need to find unity.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.960
And it's as simple as that, basically.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.080
If people on the left and on the centre

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.640
are able to be aggressive and relentless in

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.600
their pursuit of common ground, they can win,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.560
and I think that common ground is the economy.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.720
I think it's inequality.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.480
I don't see any other way of stopping Reform.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.080
So, if that's what you want to do, if you want

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.320
to stop Reform, if you want to see a more equal

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.200
country, you need to focus on that in your arguments.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.560
Find that common ground.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.520
Focus on your common ground and

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.920
unity when you speak to other people.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.200
So I'm going to have a word for people who

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.600
want Reform to win, but before that, I just want to

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.480
talk a little bit about what happens if Reform do win.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.280
And I know we have viewers all over the country.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.440
It's not just Reform here, because the far-right

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.960
are winning and are about to win all over the world.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.240
You know, my big concern if Reform win

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.520
is not actually really Farage and Reform.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.040
It's not, it's not the current far-right.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.120
I know these guys get called fascists

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.400
and they get called racists.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.360
I don't think they are all fascists and racists.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.200
My big concern is that when Reform get into

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.840
power, the same thing will happen to Reform

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.160
as what happened to Labour, what happened

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.360
to Rishi Sunak, what has happened to Trump.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.480
Even what happened to Biden.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.000
What has happened to basically every

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.800
politician and political party in the last 15 years.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.040
They come in.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.520
They don't deal with the fundamental economic

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.200
problem, which is growing inequality.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.000
Living standards worsen, and then they find themself

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.360
in the same situation Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.640
found themselves in, which is like, "Okay, we're in.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.000
We're failing on the economy.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.440
We're super unpopular.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.880
We need to roll the dice.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.000
We need to rebrand.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.720
What do we do?" And you have this situation here

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.800
where Labour are kind of stuck in the centre, and when

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.280
you're in the centre, you don't really know where to go.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.720
I said this about Trump before you came

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.080
in, and I think it's proving true,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.360
and I'll say the same about Reform.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.960
It's when they come in, their

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.720
economic policies aren't working.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.280
The obvious political move is to say, "This is because

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.880
we are not going far enough on immigration." I think

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.280
it's a... It's just the re- It's just so... And you

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.960
can say, "Look, it's because we're being blocked.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.000
Labour are blocking us, or the courts are blocking us,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.840
or the European Court of Human Rights are blocking

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.600
us, or the academics are blocking us, or the lefties

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.360
are blocking us, or The Guardian's blocking us." And

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.520
you can say, "The reason that the economy is not

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.280
working is because we are not being aggressive enough

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.480
on immigration." So, at the moment, the emphasis

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.760
is on illegal immigration or asylum seekers.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.960
And, okay, you leave the European... You

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.920
leave the European Court of Human Rights,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.920
you know, the Convention on Refugees, and

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.840
you say, "The UK doesn't accept any refugees.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.880
Done." That's not going to fix the economy.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.600
I guarantee you.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.720
I'll bet you any money that will not fix the economy.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.720
Then you say, "Okay, well, you know, the

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.760
reason for that is because, you know, that

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.800
was just one part of migration, you know?

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.440
Look at all the enormous amounts of legal migration,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.480
and legal migration is much, much, much bigger

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.080
than asylum seeking." So, okay, we need to get

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.400
rid of legal migration, and if you do that,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.720
that's not going to fix the economic problems.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.200
So, you get rid of legal migration.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.080
You're still not fixing the economic problem.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.280
What do you do next?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.920
Well, the obvious place to go next is to

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.520
say, "Well, that wasn't enough because we've

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.200
already had too much migration" right.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.240
So you go back and you look at people who have recently

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.160
migrated in the last five years, in the last 10

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.120
years, and you say, "Okay, we need to get rid

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.720
of recent migrants." You know, these people

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.320
might be British citizens in many cases.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.840
They might have permanent residency.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.720
So you start to kick out recent... recent migrants.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.360
What if that doesn't work?

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.800
You know, what... My real concern is

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.200
this can keep going further and then

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.040
you can start scapegoating more groups.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.200
You know, there was a clip online.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.320
Did you see that clip with the American...

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.880
with the Fox News anchor saying he

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.840
thinks we should kill homeless people?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.720
[Jack] What?

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.360
[Gary] Let's get this one up.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.880
Okay.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.280
Yes, there was a clip on the

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.680
right-wing American station recently,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.400
Fox News, where they're talking about how to

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.200
deal with the problem of homelessness.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.440
This is, you know, this is not the future.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.360
This is today.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.440
Either you take the resources that we're going to

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.320
give you and... Or you decide that you gotta be locked

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.120
up in jail, that's the way it has to be now.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.880
Or involuntary lethal injection- Yeah or something.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.560
Just kill 'em.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.160
Yeah, Brian, why did it have to get to this point?

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.880
Right?

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.880
You know, the... I think this...

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.960
That really happened, by the way.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.560
This is a really genuine thing that happened

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.680
in the US, which is a Fox News host

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.480
suggested that the way to deal with the problem of

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.760
homelessness is to execute all the homeless people.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.960
So, I... And I'm not... Listen, I'm not saying that

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.040
Farage wants this, you know, and I'm not saying even

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:31.560
that Trump wants this, but, when your plan to deal with

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.800
the economy is to scapegoat a group of people, and

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.680
then you hit that group of people, you kick them out of

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.200
the country and it doesn't work, and you're unpopular,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:47.120
the obvious thing to do next is to go harder.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.920
And you're seeing this now in... You're seeing on the

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.480
biggest news channel in the US, anchors suggesting

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.440
the thing to do is to murder all the homeless people.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.240
Listen, I'm not saying Farage wants to do that, right?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.520
I'm an economist.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.440
I think Farage will win the next election.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.080
They will fail on the economy.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.000
The obvious political move will to be...

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.240
be to go further, and I am very, very worried

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.400
about where this could go in the end.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.960
And I would like that hopefully to

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.480
sharpen your mind, both if you want

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.480
Farage to win and if you don't want Farage to win.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.560
But listen, if they win, I think we do need to be

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.960
ready for this because I think they probably will win.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.200
There would also be massive political opportunity,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.280
which is the sense that, at the moment, Farage has

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.920
the phenomenal strength of never having been in

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.160
power, which means that he cannot be blamed for

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.120
any of the economic weaknesses that the UK is in.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.520
Because the Conservatives were

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.480
in for 14 years, they failed.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.720
Labour have been in for a year, they

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.120
are failing and will keep failing.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.360
And he has this ability to say, "Well, I have this

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.440
magic bullet and it's going to work." When he comes

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.400
in, just as Trump has just come in, living standards

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.200
will keep falling and we need to be ready to say what

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.120
I've always said, which is, "This is what will happen

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.920
if you don't deal with inequality." Until and unless

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.280
we have a powerful and cohesive narrative, a

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.080
powerful story, which I think should be about

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.840
inequality and about billionaires, the only

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.240
political space, because the centre is obviously

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.240
failing, will be to go further and further Right.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.720
Okay.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.760
Now, I want to go on to

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.240
the people who want Reform to win.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.880
I went on LBC yesterday, on Tom

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.480
Swarbrick's show, I did a live phone in.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.280
And, somebody called in and he said... he said

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.160
that he wa- he's a fan of the channel, so he might be

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.040
out there watching today, and he says he enjoys

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.640
the videos and he enjoys the stuff that we put out.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.240
But he said to me, "You're not going to win

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.440
because what I care about is immigration and,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.760
and there's millions of us in this country

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.960
that what we care about is immigration.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.040
And maybe not you," talking to me, "Maybe not

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.720
you, Gary, you don't maybe do this, but your

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.160
supporters, they turn around to us and

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.200
they call us bigots and they call us racists.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.360
And I'm not a racist, I just...

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.480
I'm just worried about immigration.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.520
I want there to be less immigration."

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.200
This is what this guy said to me.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.160
And I just want to make it very, very clear

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.200
because I know probably if you are a Reform

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.600
voter, you might be hearing things online about

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.040
me, that I'm a radical leftist or whatever.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.320
There is a space for you here.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.640
I do this for you.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.320
Not just only for you, but I do this for all of the

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.680
hardworking men and women in this country and across

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.840
the world who see their living standards falling.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.600
Okay?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.200
I know it's broken, I know it's not working, and I

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.320
know when you look at the politicians around you,

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.840
you see a lot of people who think you're pretty ****.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.040
And if honest... if I'm honest

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.240
I think the same thing as you.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240
I understand that.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.080
I understand that.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.120
And that's exactly why I do what I do.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.800
I walked away from a lot of money to do this

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.880
because I could see the way the country was going.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.520
I know that there's not a lot of

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.280
great political leaders out there.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.240
I don't trust the guys that are leading it.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.440
They are very, very wealthy people.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.920
They're funded by very, very wealthy people.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.840
Their plan is to cut the taxes of very, very wealthy

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.800
people and to fund that by cutting your public services,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.040
your education, the NHS, the things that you need.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.960
That's not going to work out well for you and your kids.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.600
There's a space for you here.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.680
I don't take sides.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.960
I'm an economist.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.560
I do what I do for the future of this country,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.680
for the future of ordinary people like you,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.560
families like yours, your kids, your grandkids.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.200
I'm a very good economist.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.800
I've got a very good track record.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.400
I've got a lot of educational videos, which

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.240
I'll put up here for free, which you can watch

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.680
for free to understand what's happening.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.280
If you do not deal with growing inequality, the

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.240
living standards of your kids and your grandkids

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.520
will get worse and worse and worse and worse.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.280
There's a space for you here.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.560
And I know when I, when I say that, that I don't

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.800
trust your leaders, you're going to turn around and

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.520
you're going to point to Keir Starmer and you're

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.480
going to say, "Well, I don't trust him either."

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.440
And the truth is, I agree with you.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.160
I wish we had more good political leaders.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.480
And at the moment, maybe we don't.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.240
I'm working hard to build that

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.760
and I would like your support.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.840
We're building something here that's

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.040
going to put more money in your pocket, that's

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.920
going to mean your kids can have homes.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.760
But there's something else I need say as well.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.200
Listen, I'm from London and I grew up in a very

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.920
multicultural place with lots of people, lots of

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:57.520
different colours, lots of different countries.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.800
And last weekend, I had friends who were scared to leave

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.880
the house, were scared to walk on the streets of London.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.760
And that's because they think you're racists.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.720
That's what they think.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.600
And I tell those people that, "You're not all racists.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.000
That a lot of you are just worried about the

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.200
future of this country." And they don't believe me.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.120
So I need you to prove me right.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.800
If it's about immigration and it's

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.880
not about racism, keep saying that.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.760
And if you see racists in your movement,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.040
you need to do something about that.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.000
Because these economic problems that we're seeing

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.440
in our country of growing inequality, falling living

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.880
standards, unaffordability of housing, I guarantee you

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.200
right now, they are affecting people on both sides.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.080
And I guarantee you right now, if you guys are

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.880
not able to aggressively find your common ground

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.440
and unity, that division will tear this country

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.000
apart and will destroy the living standards

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.360
for your futures, your kids and your grandkids.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.600
So listen, that's my final message.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.480
I don't like doing this schoolteacher ****.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.640
I don't know if it's going to work.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.640
But, if you're divided, you will lose.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.000
And I'm not saying that just to the

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.400
Right, I'm not saying that just to

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.200
the Left, I'm saying that to everyone.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.720
If you are divided, you will lose.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.760
Every single year, the richer get richer.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.360
Every single year, the rich get richer

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.280
and richer and richer and richer.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.680
And ordinary people lose their homes.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.320
And ordinary families can't

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320
afford to have kids, you know.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.560
Can't afford to turn the heating on.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.400
That is what happens.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.280
If you're divided, you will lose.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.320
If you are divided, you will lose.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.160
You will spend your time fighting each other

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.000
and the rich will take everything.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
You're going to need each other.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.600
Don't forget that.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.880
Tax wealth, not work.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.840
Thank you very much.
