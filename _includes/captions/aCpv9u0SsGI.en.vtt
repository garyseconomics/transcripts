00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
...and then Rishi Sunak comes out and says&nbsp;
'I will pledge to bring down inflation' and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.380
I was thinking this guy this guy that is like&nbsp;
me saying (we filmed this in January) that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.180
me saying I'll pledge in the next 6 months to&nbsp;
bring the temperature up by at least 10 degrees

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.000
yeah go on what do you wanna ask? 
I mean you even&nbsp;touched on it just now but

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.740
you've talked about how important accountability is
is and that&nbsp;people should be you know held accountable

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.200
for their predictions, don't know if you caught it in the&nbsp;
news today but Rishi Sunak made some predictions...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
okay yeah this is good I'm glad you asked me this&nbsp;
*is this not what you wanted?* all right so&nbsp;this is&nbsp;

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.400
funny right so today Rishi Sunak has come out&nbsp;
with his five big pledges is it five five pledges? &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.960
um and pledge number one maybe is um that he's&nbsp;
gonna cut in first in in half and it is funny right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.540
because me and you (me and Sim) the guy that 
does the videos, me and Sim was talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.360
earlier today and about predictions and I said&nbsp;
inflation will come down and we know inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.760
will come down because every month you have&nbsp;
inflation right and then the number they show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.920
on the news is the annual inflation so it's the&nbsp;
last 12 months right and the big inflation months&nbsp;

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.560
last year were I think like April May maybe March&nbsp;
April May big big inflation months right so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.040
know that in six months time those massive months&nbsp;
will drop out of the data so we know with almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.220
certainty that inflation is going to come&nbsp;
down really quickly and I was saying like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.540
if we wanted to be cheeky we could go on&nbsp;
the channel and we could make a prediction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.900
inflation will come down even though really&nbsp;
it's obvious that it will come down even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.960
though it's definite it will come down and then&nbsp;
Rishi Sunak comes out and says I will pledge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.620
to bring down inflation and I was thinking&nbsp;
this guy this guy that is like me saying&nbsp;right&nbsp;

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.180
we're filming this in January that's me&nbsp;
saying I'll pledge in the next six months to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.000
bring the temperature up by at least 10&nbsp;
degrees you know this you know like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.200
we know with almost certainty already this&nbsp;
thing will happen right and he's saying

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.600
Me, Rishi Sunak I'm gonna do this, 
this guy's a joke right this&nbsp;guy's such a joker

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.360
 but I mean what can you say&nbsp;man? 
cheers Rishi Sunak, its a good strategy

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.700
you know he will succeed&nbsp;at least in 
that one part of his five point policy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.960
because any [*] could succeed in the thing&nbsp;that
was going to happen anyway um but well done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.580
and I think what we should add inflation&nbsp;coming 
down does not mean prices coming down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.400
inflation is the rate of increase in prices so it 
just means that prices are going to stop going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.500
as fast as they were so you know you don't 
make&nbsp;things better he said what he's saying is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.380
I'm gonna make the rate at which your life is getting&nbsp;
worse a bit slower so well done billionaire Rishi Sunak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.700
I'm sure the country will be proud of your work&nbsp;
*you use the word joke I think you're right but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.760
I know part of me thinks the jokes on us because&nbsp;
it will work, people will be like yeah he said it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.680
and it's happened so* personally I don't think&nbsp;
that Rishi Sunak is very popular I don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.040
he will be very popular um and I think this is... 
I'm&nbsp;an economist not politician right, but first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.300
I think the guy um does not come across as very&nbsp;
human or very understanding of ordinary people &nbsp;

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.260
did you see the clip the other day of him in the soup&nbsp;
kitchen asking a homeless man if he's thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.820
about getting into Finance? *it's beyond belief!*&nbsp;
yeah um yeah so I think he's not very personally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.260
likable I think he's quite out of touch you see&nbsp;the
clip when he was a kid when he was saying you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.480
know "I've got friends who are upper class, friends&nbsp;who 
are middle class, friends who are working class...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.440
well not working class!" did you see that one? 
this is&nbsp;a very wealthy guy from very wealthy family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.260
um I never met him he could be personally&nbsp;
a very nice guy, we don't know, he might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.480
um but beyond his personal failings I think&nbsp;
the main reason why Rishi Sunak will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.500
be popular is because the economy the&nbsp;
economic situation is going to get worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.620
it's going to get worse and like it's bad right&nbsp;
what is happening is bad and it's going to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.160
worse and the reason I know that is because&nbsp;
as I've been speaking about from the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.560
in the last few years there's been a massive&nbsp;
transfer of cash from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.520
through which are still sitting on that money&nbsp;
they will use that money to buy their assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.720
from the middle class to drive up things like&nbsp;
house prices to the drive up things like stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.860
prices which makes the rich richer and makes&nbsp;
it harder for middle class people to move up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.880
so we know the middle class will shrink we know&nbsp;
life will continue to become more unaffordable for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.380
ordinary people we know these things will happen&nbsp;
and we know there's no mechanism to reverse that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.460
because once the rich get richer they buy more&nbsp;
assets from the middle class middle class gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.620
poorer which means that the rate of inequality&nbsp;
increasing increases more because the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.620
class has a less assets and the rich have more&nbsp;
assets so we know things will get worse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.260
ultimately at the end of the day that the&nbsp;
speed at which life is getting worse now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.460
people are not going to accept it of course&nbsp;
people are not going to accept that and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.840
wouldn't be surprised this is not expected in the&nbsp;
betting market I wouldn't be surprised if Rishi&nbsp;Sunak&nbsp;

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.640
is replaced before the next election because&nbsp;
he's unpopular I don't think it will get bought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.180
I don't think it will be bought I think that I&nbsp;
think that um it will not be popular I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.020
the conservatives will lose the next election&nbsp;but 
as I've spoken about many times on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.100
my big fear is not that the conservatives win the&nbsp;
next election although I hope that they don't&nbsp;

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.140
it's that labour wins the next election they don't&nbsp;
do anything about wealth inequality things continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.520
to get worse and then people start feeling&nbsp;
like we need something more extreme you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.920
we need something more extreme and then we you&nbsp;
know what is happening now in terms of the rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.920
decrease in living standards the rapid increase&nbsp;
inequality very similar to the 1920s and 1930s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.860
you know look what happened then, Europe 
fell into fascism we had the second world war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.240
we had the Holocaust, we had the Nazis, you know 
I'm&nbsp;not saying, look, I'm not saying these things will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.380
happen again you know and I pray to God that&nbsp;
these things do not happen again but if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.240
people will vote for something sensible 3 times,
4 times, 5 times, maybe 6 times and if&nbsp;every

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.000
single time their life gets worse and worse&nbsp;and 
worse eventually they'll vote for something&nbsp;insane&nbsp;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.400
and you can understand why they&nbsp;would do 
that right so you know I take a step back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.240
from Rishi Sunak and I look at the global picture&nbsp;
and I think this is important people understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.060
that what is happening in the UK is not happening&nbsp;
just in the UK that it is true that the UK has had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.540
a particular dive in the last like five six&nbsp;
years living standards have fallen a lot but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.220
living standards are falling everywhere for&nbsp;the
average person in the United States which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.720
supposed to be the richest country in the world 
in&nbsp;Western Europe even in countries like Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.400
which are considered to be rich you know 
I lived in Japan&nbsp;for 2 years, I know Japan very well

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.860
even in Japan life is getting worse and life is 
getting&nbsp;harder especially if you don't come from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.380
a family of assets right so and some of&nbsp;these 
countries have left wing governments&nbsp;right&nbsp;

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.520
you know the Democrats are in charge in&nbsp;the U.S 
um Spain and Germany both have left wing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.720
governments and they are, even in those&nbsp;cases, 
massive increase in inequality during&nbsp;Covid-19

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.940
massive decrease in living standards&nbsp;
so this is a problem that is bigger than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.240
Conservatives, Labour, Republicans, Democrats
this is about an understanding of the importance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.980
of wealth inequality and a willingness to&nbsp;
make that change in spite of the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.400
most major political parties are funded by&nbsp;
billionaires right or very wealthy people so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.520
I think what we need to do and the people&nbsp;
who support this channel need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.800
we need to really build that bridge between&nbsp;
wealth inequality is bad from an ethical moral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.040
perspective and wealth inequality is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your&nbsp;
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lives, your family, your economy in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.420
that will get worse and worse and worse you know&nbsp;
I've used this analogy a number of times on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:11.280
channel that wealth inequality is cancer and I&nbsp;
know that is strong language and I don't use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.720
accidentally the reason I use that language&nbsp;
is because wealth inequality is a thing which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.120
if left to its own devices will grow and will&nbsp;
grow and will grow and will grow and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.100
suck the wealth out of the middle class and&nbsp;
it will leave you with a very unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.260
like like the economy in Brazil for example&nbsp;
that is what will happen here you know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.800
that is like a cancer if you don't do anything&nbsp;
about it it grows and it grows and it grows and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.600
it grows and it sucks away the resources that you&nbsp;
need and eventually you will die you know this is

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.100
I'm not I don't understand everything about&nbsp;
the economy but I understand this one thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.720
if you allow this thing to grow unchecked it&nbsp;
will destroy everything. it will make the NHS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.160
unaffordable - we will lose it, it'll make education&nbsp;
unaffordable - we will lose it, it will make housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.080
unaffordable and we will lose it and this is not a&nbsp;
UK specific problem you know we've been getting a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.920
lot of messages from America lately and what do&nbsp;
they say every single one of them says the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.360
thing it's the same in the USA, *well Australia*&nbsp;
even like you know Australia was considered a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.020
very wealthy country right every single one of&nbsp;
these messages it's the same thing it's the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:20.040
thing it's the same thing and you know at the&nbsp;
same time you know the government wants to say

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.400
us because the foreign is because of brexit this&nbsp;
is an international problem, International problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.660
and you're not going to fix it by voting these&nbsp;
people out right in the end you need to demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.040
a reduction in wealth inequality and you need to&nbsp;
say I'm not going to vote for anyone that doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.620
give us a reduction in wealth inequality you&nbsp;
know listen if you know okay I've been quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.520
critical of the conservatives on this channel if&nbsp;
they were to turn around and convince me really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.940
convince me that they were going to reduce wealth&nbsp;
inequality I would vote for them and I would tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.440
the viewers to vote for them because that is what&nbsp;
matters what matters is that you kill this cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.460
that is what matters you need to get rid of this&nbsp;
you need to do all this thing and I don't think&nbsp;they&nbsp;

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.020
they will do that because the prime minister is&nbsp;
worth 770 million pounds and his father-in-law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.000
is one of the richest men in the world...

00:10:00.858 --> 00:10:02.399
money&nbsp;currently is flowing from the government 
to the rich leaving the government with big piles

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:09.580
of&nbsp;debt and the rich with big parts of money 
there's one other thing they can do with that

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.420
massive&nbsp;amount of income 
they can buy your mom's house
