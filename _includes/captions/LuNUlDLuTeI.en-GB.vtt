00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.680
i want to talk about um

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.280
the mental health of being a trader&nbsp;
because you know being a trader is

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.000
a great job in terms of the money you make but&nbsp;
there's a darker side to that sometimes you know

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.960
you know i remember

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.320
on the trading floor people become traders because&nbsp;
they want to make money you know what i mean

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.080
and i became a trader because&nbsp;
i wanted to make money and

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.800
it's almost all men on these training floors&nbsp;
or at least it was when i worked there

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.880
and there's so much like ambition and&nbsp;
so much determination to be successful

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.440
and so much drive but to be honest like a lot&nbsp;
of the time what people want is they just want

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.720
drive they want success they want money they don't&nbsp;
really care how they make it and um it can drive

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
men into like such a competitive space you&nbsp;
know what i mean like there was this one time

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.400
when i just first started as a trader like i was&nbsp;
getting to know the traders on the desk and um

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.720
one of the guys on my team he took me out drinking&nbsp;
one evening and he went out late late into the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.360
evening and it got to like 1AM and i was like i&nbsp;
gotta go home and we used to start work at 7 in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.360
the morning you know i was like i want to go home&nbsp;
and he was like no stay out stay at mine you know

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.440
we can have like a big night and i stayed out we&nbsp;
stayed up all night and by the time i got to work

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.320
i was absolutely smashed like i was like super&nbsp;
hungover i went to the bathroom and i threw up

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.360
and then my boss sent me home and i was like oh&nbsp;
my god i'm gonna get fired but i came in super

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.480
early the next day and then my boss came in and&nbsp;
he said to me about the senior trader i went out

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.280
with he said did that guy do that to you last&nbsp;
night and i just laughed i didn't say anything

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.040
then the senior trader came in and the&nbsp;
boss the first thing he said to him was

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.120
Gary said you did that to him and then this guy&nbsp;
right i remember at the time i used to sit on the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.360
edge of the desk and there was an empty seat to&nbsp;
the next of me and beyond that was this guy who

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.920
i went out with and he was like in his early 30s&nbsp;
he was a big guy he played rugby right big guy

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.400
right and um i was sitting there doing my work&nbsp;
on a computer and i turn around and look at him

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.840
the guy was looking at me straight in my face like&nbsp;
this and he was growling like a wolf like this&nbsp;&nbsp;*grrr grrr*

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.320
and then under the desk was like was the computer&nbsp;
but they were behind like a pair of doors and he

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.160
was growling and he was kicking these doors *BAM*
like that on the training floor you know what i mean

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.840
and that's when i realized like man there's some&nbsp;
crazy guys in this space you know what i mean like

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.880
but this same guy i remember my very first day&nbsp;
at work i went to have lunch from the canteen,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.280
had lunch, come back and he said to me where&nbsp;
have you been i said I've been to the canteen

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.840
he said I've worked here for 12 years i never once&nbsp;
had lunch with a canteen we eat lunch on the desk

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.960
that was on my first day there right and i see&nbsp;
like they're trying to sort of haze you into a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.560
space where you feel like your responsibility is&nbsp;
there have to be on the desk, have to be all the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.080
time and like when you're working on the trading&nbsp;
floor there's all these sounds there's all these

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.760
noises going off and like at 12:30 whatever&nbsp;
inflation for the UK is coming out and then 13:30

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.360
employment date for the US is coming out&nbsp;
the guy would turn up behind me and be like

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.640
what was the US inflation data? and it had just&nbsp;
come out one minute before you know what i mean

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.160
and you're like **** i don't know i don't know and&nbsp;
you feel like you have to know you have to know

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.080
like and you you get into this situation where you&nbsp;
start to feel like you need to know every single

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.840
thing that's happening all the time you know&nbsp;
what i mean and when you become a big trader

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.520
like you've got these trades running for your book&nbsp;
all the time all the time you have to check them

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.960
people will book wrong trades into your book to&nbsp;
try and take money off you have to check them

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.640
you have to go and get the money back you start to&nbsp;
feel like you're surrounded by wolves in a sense

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.120
and i remember this one time eventually when&nbsp;
i was becoming a really successful trader i

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.120
was able to hire my own junior trader and i&nbsp;
hired this young guy Italian guy a nice guy

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.280
and he was my junior in 2011 which was the year&nbsp;
that i became the most profitable trader in the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.440
bank and you know he thought that i was, that was&nbsp;
great because he was a junior for the most profitable

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.880
trader in the bank you know what i mean but he&nbsp;
was quite critical of me sometimes and he said

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.840
to me listen Gary i think you're a great trader&nbsp;
but you've got a problem with your personality

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.160
which is your too homo homini lupus that's&nbsp;
what he said and i was like what the?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.320
homo homini lupus? He goes homo homini lupus&nbsp;
is Latin it means a man is wolf to man

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.880
and i was like what do you mean what are you&nbsp;
talking about he goes you think you're surrounded

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.640
by wolves you think everyone is a wolf and i said&nbsp;
look at this place look at where you are look at

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.200
the people around you i think i'm surrounded&nbsp;
by wolves because i am surrounded by wolves

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.680
and then i think in hindsight that's probably a&nbsp;
sign that he was exactly right his criticism of

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.520
what he was saying you know what i mean but um you&nbsp;
know i loved my time on the trading floor in some

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.360
senses i worked with some amazing people i learned&nbsp;
so much about economics about how the world works

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.440
but i definitely internalize this sense that the&nbsp;
world is full of wolves and people are out to get

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.480
you people are out to take your money and it's a&nbsp;
competition and that in turn this understanding

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.840
that the world is full of wolves that fed the&nbsp;
wolf inside of me and in a sense i became a wolf

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.880
and i was out there to take other people's&nbsp;
money on the floor you know what i mean

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.160
and i was out there to be the best myself you know&nbsp;
i mean that year 2011 when i made a lot of money

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.320
i was working with another trader who was&nbsp;
much older he was already a very rich guy

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.040
and um he wasn't on the desk a lot he&nbsp;
would go out you know he'd go out drinking

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.960
you know and this and then one time he lost a lot&nbsp;
of money while he was off the desk and that year

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.840
i was making a lot of money and he thought that&nbsp;
i should give him money back and i was like nah

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.480
it's not happening you know what i mean because&nbsp;
for me it was just about me and my space and

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.160
my money and i was making that money to get&nbsp;
my family out of the ghetto you know i mean

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:12.640
but what i want to talk about is that drive&nbsp;
that drives us as young men to be successful

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.840
and how powerful it can be but also how&nbsp;
damaging it can be that it can become

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.160
completely all-consuming and suddenly you can&nbsp;
start viewing other people as purely competition

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.520
and then that can just destroy your own mental&nbsp;
health because ultimately we are social creatures

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.960
and we need to be able to trust one another and if&nbsp;
we can't do that then we're not going to be happy

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.440
and i remember after the end of 2011 and that&nbsp;
was the year i was the best trader in the bank

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.120
in early 2012 i got my bonus and like in the&nbsp;
second half of 2011 all i could think about

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160
was this bonus because this is like winning&nbsp;
the lottery you know it's going to take me

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.360
and my family it's going to change my life&nbsp;
my family's life for all of the whole future

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.440
and then i was obsessed with getting this&nbsp;
bonus getting this bonus is all i cared about

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.840
and then in the beginning of 2012 it happened&nbsp;
i got the bonus um and it was so much money

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.920
it's gonna change my life you know but i didn't&nbsp;
feel happy at all the first thing i thought was

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.200
i have to make this money secure i have to make&nbsp;
sure it's all well invested i have to make it

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.600
safe that's all i thought about it didn't give me&nbsp;
no joy and i went back home and i pulled open my

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.520
computer and i had all my paperwork and i got all&nbsp;
my spreadsheets out and i was like thinking this

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.720
money is going to go here that money's going to&nbsp;
go there like it's all going to be secure and then

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.480
the girl who i was seeing at the time she was&nbsp;
a fantastic girl and she come to my house and

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.200
and then she saw me there sitting in the corner&nbsp;
doing all my paper doing all my spreadsheets

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.880
and she said um what you doing and i said um well&nbsp;
i'm you know i'm doing all my spreadsheets i've

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.120
got to figure out how to invest this money and&nbsp;
she was like oh you seem pretty stressed and i

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.000
was like of course i'm stressed it's a lot of&nbsp;
money this is important you know what i mean

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.560
and then she said to me if i made&nbsp;
as much money as what you just made

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.840
the last thing i'll be doing is sitting in&nbsp;
the corner of my living room stressing out

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.040
and um i realized she was obviously&nbsp;
she was right she was right that um

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.440
the money it wasn't making me happy it was&nbsp;
just pulling me away from where i came from

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.800
and the people that i grew up with and from&nbsp;
everything that i knew and all it was doing was

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.560
giving me stress but at the same time i totally&nbsp;
understand that it's that money that gives me the

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.120
power to do what i'm doing now to devote my life&nbsp;
and my time to trying to talk about economics and

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.760
trying to talk about inequality so it's&nbsp;
a flip side of it but what i'm saying is

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040
i don't want to live in a world where you have&nbsp;
to choose you know where the only way to get the

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.320
freedom to do meaningful work is to like make&nbsp;
a crazy amount of money i wanna live in a world

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.640
where ordinary people can get enough money&nbsp;
from ordinary jobs that if they want to take

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.120
some time out to do meaningful work they can you&nbsp;
know i mean i don't want to live in a world where

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.040
i have to choose between being an ordinary person&nbsp;
and having financial security i want to be an

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.040
ordinary person and have financial security i want&nbsp;
to have financial security and live in the world

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.960
with other people that come from where i'm from&nbsp;
with financial security you know so that's what

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.760
i'm saying well that's why i do the work that i do&nbsp;
because i want i know that we can have that kind

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.440
of world we can have a world where ordinary people&nbsp;
can get financial security i'm not saying it's

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.160
going to be a paradise but we can make an economy&nbsp;
where ordinary people if they're willing to work

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.960
and get financial security we had that 50 years&nbsp;
ago we had that 60 years ago i don't want to be

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.440
in a space where my kids are in my situation where&nbsp;
they have to choose either to live in this like

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.320
niche world of wealthy people that don't know the&nbsp;
real world or to struggle you know what i'm saying

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.840
but yeah the last i wanted to add on this&nbsp;
subject of mental health is that like um

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.360
i was very successful by the metrics of the&nbsp;
way a lot of people view success for men

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.360
i made a lot of money you know i had a&nbsp;
beautiful girlfriend i had a nice apartment

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.720
but i struggled in a lot of ways um it was&nbsp;
really difficult for me quitting my job and

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.920
like i felt really separated from where i came&nbsp;
from and the people that i knew um so when i

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.840
see young men out there struggling struggling&nbsp;
hard to make money to make money to make money

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.720
i understand it because it was me and i did it&nbsp;
but um i also want those people to realize that

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.120
money alone is not happiness and there's so many&nbsp;
other things which are important and which people

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.120
should be grateful for like friendship and like&nbsp;
family um and i wish we didn't live in a world

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.080
where it was so difficult just to get that&nbsp;
basic amount of money you need to feel safe

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.400
and i totally understand people are going&nbsp;
to push and push and push till they get that

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.600
but at the same time i want people to understand&nbsp;
that the world that we live in is unfair and it's

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.160
difficult and there's a lot of luck involved to&nbsp;
be honest and if you are not making as much money

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.960
as you want that doesn't mean you're a failure you&nbsp;
know i come from a poor family and i don't look up

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.680
to anyone more than i look up to my dad because he&nbsp;
worked every day and he gave us what we needed and

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.600
even though he was poor the biggest problems in&nbsp;
my life was never about money you know what i mean

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.920
the most important thing is having a&nbsp;
happiness having that secure family around you

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.200
but when you do go through difficult&nbsp;
times like i did i think the most

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.480
important thing is to remember that you're not&nbsp;
surrounded by wolves even if you think you are

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.160
there will be people around you who will&nbsp;
be willing to just be there and support you

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.800
and if you feel that there's no one&nbsp;
there right now then someone will come

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.520
and um when those people are there it's&nbsp;
really important to reach out to them i

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.480
think that's the thing that's gonna keep&nbsp;
you sane in the difficult times and um

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.520
when things get really really difficult and&nbsp;
you can't reach out and feel that you can't

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.440
the most important thing to do at that time is&nbsp;
to just hold on until things get better because

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.840
they will like when you hit the bottom you&nbsp;
can't go further you can only bounce back up

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.640
and if you reach a point where you&nbsp;
feel that you you can't hold on

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.160
that's the time when you really have to hold&nbsp;
on and that's what's going to determine like

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.640
that's what's going to turn you into&nbsp;
a man i think if you can do that

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.040
you cannot be surprised when these people turn&nbsp;
to crime and these people turn to dangerous means

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.120
of getting it if the best people were in the best&nbsp;
jobs then they've come from all throughout society

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:47.440
but right now they all come from the&nbsp;
same schools and the same families
