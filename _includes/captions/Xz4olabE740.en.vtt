00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.680
all right this video is going to be&nbsp;
the response to the budget on Friday so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.840
we're filming this on Thursday, Thursday&nbsp;
29th so the budget was six days ago um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.340
first I'm going to just say straight up&nbsp;
this is going to be a bit of a longer video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.300
than the normal videos um and that is because&nbsp;
the budget situation is a very serious situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.540
um normally for YouTube we sort of shoot for&nbsp;
like 10 minuteish videos because like that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
whatever it is better on YouTube um and we kind&nbsp;
of snip it up to make it like good YouTube length&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.840
but that obviously requires some editing and&nbsp;
some sort of like careful planning and for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.660
um basically I just didn't want to snip anything&nbsp;
up or cut anything down because it just didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.860
feel like the right thing to do basically because&nbsp;
it's a very serious situation there's like a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.480
to talk about so ultimately it's going to be a&nbsp;
very long video and um you can watch as much as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.620
little as you want but given the seriousness&nbsp;
of the situation I just felt like we just have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.020
to basically do talk about everything all the way&nbsp;
through um and I've got my computer here so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.780
I can sort of try and get everything in um and&nbsp;
the video is going to be split into two parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.040
First i'm just going to talk about basically my&nbsp;
experience of the budget and that's like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.300
little bit not normally what we do it's more&nbsp;
like a very analytical channel and there will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.780
be analytics and if you want just that if&nbsp;
you want just the analysis we will put a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.020
little button up so you can skip straight&nbsp;
to it um but the budget was just quite a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.660
a big moment for me and I want to talk about&nbsp;
that just because I think it's it's important

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480
but basically it gave me some conflicted&nbsp;
emotions about even doing this video and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
I think it's it's important that people realise&nbsp;
the importance of the situation you know the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.000
few days I was at Labour conference and there&nbsp;
was a lot of sort of optimism there because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.880
you know given this sort of catastrophic collapse&nbsp;
in in the government they're sort of thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640
we're going to win the next election and it&nbsp;
just sort of left me standing there thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.480
I'm not quite sure people understand&nbsp;
just how serious this is so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.180
so I want to just talk about what it&nbsp;
was like for me to watch the budget&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.220
um maybe it's much because I want to get off my&nbsp;
chest but I think I think um people need to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.220
it from the human side as well as the analysis&nbsp;
so we're going to start with that and like I say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.700
if you want to skip it you can skip it and we'll&nbsp;
tell you where to skip to we're filming this on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.880
the Thursday the budget was last Friday um so I&nbsp;
live in East London quite close to Canary Wharf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.760
where I used to work I've got like quite a nice&nbsp;
apartment here that I bought when I was working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.000
um and right now I'm writing a book so you know&nbsp;
I'm not working regular hours so I woke up quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.460
late on Friday and I went I went over to the&nbsp;
kitchen over there I think we can see on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.360
camera kitchen there and you know I wake up every&nbsp;
morning and I cook myself porridge for breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.500
every day which is a promise I made to myself&nbsp;
when I quit the city and that's what I was doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.160
so I was cooking my porridge on a Friday and&nbsp;
I had that I've got a TV this year and I was I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.920
was watching the budget um and I came over with my&nbsp;
porridge I sat here and I watched the budget and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.980
so in the budget you probably are aware if you're&nbsp;
watching this video there was announced basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.840
like a massive slashing of taxes for the richest&nbsp;
people the the big thing which is unexpected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.240
was they cut the 45 percent bracket which&nbsp;
applies only to people who are above 150 grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.940
um I think it's important to realize like you hear&nbsp;
150 Grand you think that's cutting taxes on people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.280
150 Grand it's not if you're 150 Grand you are&nbsp;
unaffected by that even if you earned 200 Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.120
you're only saving not a huge amount of money&nbsp;
the people who save a huge amount of money from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.860
that tax cut people who earn sort of one million&nbsp;
two million pounds a year so it's it's a huge tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.100
cut on people who earn millions of pounds a year&nbsp;
obviously in the context of people who know who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.480
watch this channel will know in the context of&nbsp;
in the last three years the largest and fastest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.180
ever increasing inequality in the history of the&nbsp;
country and you know I think outside of wartime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.380
the largest and fastest have a decrease in broader&nbsp;
living standards in the history of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.180
um and you know um people who watch the channel&nbsp;
will know like basically the main thing we talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.640
about on the channel is is to try and get people&nbsp;
to understand that the fall in living standards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.500
is is connected to and ultimately caused by the&nbsp;
increasing inequality and understanding that when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.860
inequality increases that hurts ordinary standards&nbsp;
for living people for ordinary people um but not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.780
only that right you know the reason that I'm able&nbsp;
to live in this quite nice apartment is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.540
I used to be a trader and I made a lot of money&nbsp;
after the 2008 crisis by basically betting that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.860
because we would have very high inequality and&nbsp;
because inequality wouldn't be fixed there would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.300
be a massive collapse in living standards and that&nbsp;
the economy would never recover so so you know my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.080
my history as an adult is basically a history&nbsp;
of predicting disasters for ordinary people on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.760
the basis of increasing inequality so when I was&nbsp;
sitting here on Friday and I watched the budget&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.360
um and they're obviously announcing this&nbsp;
massive tax cuts for for very wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.100
um in the context of this cost of living&nbsp;
crisis where ordinary families increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.240
are struggling to eat and to heat their&nbsp;
homes obviously straight away I recognise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.440
that that is going to cause a&nbsp;
massive fall in living standards

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.920
now that's going to cause a massive&nbsp;fall 
in living standards ordinary people, um&nbsp;

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:31.320
and it was a strange experience right&nbsp;because
obviously I'm here you know in this quite nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.100
apartment you know and you know there's&nbsp;
a mortgage in this apartment but I could pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.920
off if I wanted to and um you know materially &nbsp;
I have a very comfortable life and I'm sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.860
watching these tax cuts on on wealthy people &amp;&nbsp;
you know I don't earn 150 Grand a year nowadays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.440
um but I'm not going to be one of the&nbsp;
people that gets hurt by these tax cuts um

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.940
and yeah it was very upsetting basically to watch

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.800
uh and it's just basically just a strange&nbsp;
experience you know because you know I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.900
here in East London close to Canary Wharf&nbsp;
but like very close to here there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:18.420
of families who are not rich and for them this&nbsp;
will cause this will mean that you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.280
it's the, it's the mum doesn't eat so&nbsp;that
the kids can eat you know and it's uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.720
that's what's gonna happen because of this and um

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.060
when I went out to the balcony and there's&nbsp;
a nice little balcony here you can see I&nbsp;think&nbsp;

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.920
this camera will catch you know, its a nice balcony 
and we have a nice view of the marina&nbsp;and we can

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:49.200
see Canary Wharf um and I was standing out on&nbsp;
this balcony um and am I in the right position now 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.880
um it's just this this sort of&nbsp;
bizarre surreal space you're in where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.660
I think most people still don't und erstand&nbsp;
the connection between inequality and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.200
and living conditions so, so in this budget&nbsp;
what the government did is it's something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.060
which in a way is quite clever because they cut&nbsp;
taxes a very small amount for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.160
so so then if you're an ordinary person you're&nbsp;
looking at sort of this maybe an extra whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:28.020
50-100 quid a month tax cut from the government&nbsp;
and you know one of my good friends called me up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.440
his name's Jeremy he asked me about the&nbsp;
budget and then and he said you know I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.520
people are going to be happy because they've&nbsp;
got this like 100 quid tax cut and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.120
I understand it because people were sitting&nbsp;
there struggling and they're like we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.620
100 quid tax cut right but at the same time&nbsp;
they're cutting taxes for very very wealthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.320
people by tens even hundreds of thousands&nbsp;
of pounds if their incomes are huge um and

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.840
you know I've been trying to make the case on&nbsp;
this channel for the last two years now you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.340
I talk about it a lot but you know if you haven't&nbsp;
watched I would really recommend you watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.000
first video on this channel how Covid-19&nbsp;
is making it which get richer you know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.560
was over two years ago now and since then I've&nbsp;
basically been trying to explain to people that

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.760
if the government gives a huge amount&nbsp;
of money to rich people it will make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.660
your life get worse primarily&nbsp;
because prices will go up and

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.080
you know during Covid the government over 
saw&nbsp;the biggest ever increase in inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.600
in the history of the country but people accepted&nbsp;
it because ordinary people had thought they had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.700
their finances protected but the reason they got&nbsp;
hurt is because if ordinary families got a grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.220
Rich family's got a 100 grand and you know I've&nbsp;
been trying to explain to people if you allow that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.620
your lives will get worse and then I see the&nbsp;
government come out with this budget where they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.540
giving ordinary families you know 50 quid of their&nbsp;
taxes and rich families 50 grand off their taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.660
and the fact that they think they can do that

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.260
the fact that they think they can do that&nbsp;
obviously means I haven't done my job well enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:12.600
because they think people will accept it um and&nbsp;
if people understood that giving huge amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.320
of money to rich people makes ordinary people's&nbsp;
lives worse because prices go up they wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.620
accept it and it's my job to try and make sure&nbsp;
people understand that and enough people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.920
understand that that the government thinks they&nbsp;
can get away with things like this and because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.720
of that you know there's going to be another&nbsp;
massive increase in poverty in this country so

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.900
it's very important that people understand this&nbsp;
and I'm going to explain it again I'm going to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.900
explaining it in a different way that hopefully&nbsp;
makes it clearer some people understand okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:50.460
Money is NOT Resources -  so money is not&nbsp;
food, money is not energy, money is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.140
housing, money is not health care, okay if&nbsp;
the government gives everyone more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.680
that doesn't mean there is more food, doesn't&nbsp;
mean there is more energy, that doesn't mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.420
there is more housing, that doesn't mean there's&nbsp;
more health care, money is the asset that we use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:12.420
to determine who gets the real assets okay&nbsp;
that's what money is, it's it doesn't make you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.300
the society rich to have more money, money is&nbsp;
used to determine who gets the real assets okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.160
so if the government gives you a £100&nbsp;and
the government gives the rich £100,000

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:30.180
you will have a hundred pounds or more cash and&nbsp;
you will get less real assets, you will get less&nbsp;food,&nbsp;

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:38.400
less energy, less housing, less health&nbsp;care
because money is about relative wealth

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:46.260
so when the government gives you a hundred&nbsp;
pounds to buy you off for giving the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.060
100 Grand or 50 Grand or whatever&nbsp;
the tax cut the rich gets

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.780
you have to understand what it means okay&nbsp;
you have to have a focus on the distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.800
and when something like Covid happens where&nbsp;
the government gives loads of money out but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.880
the people who end up richer are the rich you&nbsp;
have more money and less resources money is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.120
fundamentally a competitive resource if you&nbsp;
get a bit more money and the rich get a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:22.380
more money you will become poorer you will&nbsp;
get less housing less energy less food less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.640
health care less everything that is the way money&nbsp;
works it's a fundamentally competitive resource&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.720
um you know I'm going to say again and&nbsp;
again because if you don't understand this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.060
and if ordinary people and ordinary families who&nbsp;
are the people who get hurt don't understand this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.220
then you create a situation where the government&nbsp;
which is increasingly run by multi-millionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.660
can give you 100 quid and can give their class&nbsp;
and their rich mates a 100 grand each and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.640
you are happy with that 100 quid while they&nbsp;
get 100 grand then you and your family and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.620
your communities will get poorer and poorer and&nbsp;
poorer whilst you are getting these hundred quids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.340
so you need to step back from just saying okay&nbsp;
the government gave me 100 quid and have a broad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:12.240
understanding of what is happening with the&nbsp;
distribution here um and you need to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.040
that that quite simply this this idea that if we&nbsp;
give the rich a ton of money it's going to improve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.960
the economy and make your life a better it it's&nbsp;
quite frankly bullsh*t and the reason why I'm able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.100
to live in this luxury apartment and and I don't&nbsp;
have to pay a mortgage on it and the reason why I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.180
haven't had to work a job for 7-8 years is because&nbsp;
I've bet for years and years that that's&nbsp;bullsh*t

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.940
if you allow inequality to blow up those&nbsp;
rich people are not going to use that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.980
to improve the economy they're going to use that&nbsp;
money to buy your mom's houses and they're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.120
to give that money to their kids so that when&nbsp;
your kids go with their 50-60 grand deposit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.140
to try and buy a house their kids have got 300&nbsp;
grand deposits and your kids won't get the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.720
money is a competitive resource and if the&nbsp;
government is giving absolutely tons of it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.920
the rich whilst they're giving bits of it to you&nbsp;
you and your family and your community are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.960
poorer and um that is the key message I basically&nbsp;
want you to get from this video okay because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.600
the government did that because&nbsp;they
think they can get away with it&nbsp;and&nbsp;

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.520
the government thinks they can get away&nbsp;with it
because they think you don't understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:21.600
and they think they can give you 100 quid off&nbsp;
your taxes and they can give millionaires&nbsp;

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.400
£100,000 of their taxes and they think you'll be&nbsp;
sitting there happy with the £100 don't be&nbsp;happy

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.540
with your 100 quid understand that the&nbsp;
government is giving the rich a ton of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.200
and that money will make you poorer&nbsp;
because it will make the prices go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.140
up faster than your bank balance goes&nbsp;
up and faster than your wages go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:46.200
okay so that's the most important thing I want&nbsp;
you to understand um and now we're gonna get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.120
what happened after that because um what happened&nbsp;
after that was quite crazy and quite interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:00.660
which was so the government traditionally&nbsp;
historically when government make spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.860
promises or... this is kind of a spending promise&nbsp;
because they're cutting taxation so they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.840
getting less money in, if they're getting... 
they&nbsp;need to balance their budget historically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.060
okay so so in Covid the government didn't balance&nbsp;
their budget and they just printed and gave out a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.600
ton of money and it led to this dynamic that&nbsp;
I spoke about where ordinary families may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.700
accumulated like a grand or two grand savings if&nbsp;
they committed any many didn't and rich families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.400
accumulated honestly hundreds of thousands&nbsp;
of pounds huge amounts and that that led to &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.440
in a sense of predictable consequences which is 
um ordinary families had more money but they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.820
got less resources because money is the asset&nbsp;
we use to distribute resources you've got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.540
bit more money they've got a load more money&nbsp;
so they get more resources and you get less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.560
um but they didn't balance their&nbsp;budget 
but um because it was temporary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.420
uh markets allowed it and I think I think we&nbsp;
probably need to unpack what that means so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.660
this time round you know two things have happened&nbsp;
recently with returns, with respect to government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.000
finances which is 1.) they're spending a ton&nbsp;
of money to basically pay your energy bills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.060
and 2.) now they're massively cut taxes&nbsp;
for the richest, so both of these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.120
mean that the government less money in more&nbsp;
money out so where does the money come from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.100
so this time around they can't print the money&nbsp;
and that is because money printing is determined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.600
by the bank of England the bank of England&nbsp;
is independent the government doesn't fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.340
control the bank of England and this time around&nbsp;
the bank of England is arguably not willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.720
to print money to fund this because the bank of&nbsp;
England is worried that inflation is already high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.880
and it doesn't want inflation to go higher um so&nbsp;
that means that they try to borrow money instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.900
um and as I speak about a lot in the channel um in&nbsp;
the last few years wealthy people have accumulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.920
a lot of money so there's a lot of money to be&nbsp;
borrowed so the government essentially goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.900
wealthy people and says can we borrow the money&nbsp;
um in reality what they they go to financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.820
markets and it's Traders people like me I used&nbsp;
to be a Trader who basically determined are we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.480
going to lend your money to the government or the&nbsp;
wealthy people's money to the government or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.820
um and the Traders look at the government and&nbsp;
they say okay well you know we're not in a one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:12.540
of emergency anymore we're not in Covid anymore&nbsp;
um and yet even now in these normal times you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.420
you know running a massive deficit spending&nbsp;
much more than you get in basically so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.840
you can give the rich massive tax cuts&nbsp;and
they're looking at that and they're saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.860
well how are you how are you ever&nbsp;
going to pay that back? basically&nbsp;um&nbsp;

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:33.840
and you know I wouldn't lend my money to&nbsp;the
British government at the moment because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.880
it doesn't seem like they have a plan basically&nbsp;
to pay it back and you know the government are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.660
saying it's going to cause massive growth&nbsp;
nobody believes that, I'd be surprised if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.280
even the government believes that you know, if&nbsp;
giving money to the rich caused massive growth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:53.700
then we would be a f*cking rich country because we&nbsp;
would be growing to the moon because we've given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.840
so much money for the rich in the last three years&nbsp;
and has it caused a boom economy it looks to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.060
like it scores a disastrous economy and I think 
I&nbsp;don't know whether Liz Truss and Quasi Quartang&nbsp;

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:08.160
believe it but nobody... I don't think anybody&nbsp;
seriously believes it um so they're looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.920
at the government and they're saying okay well&nbsp;
you're borrowing, you want to borrow all this money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.660
to give it to the rich your economy is not gonna&nbsp;
to grow so how are you going to pay it back?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.660
um uh historically you know in times when&nbsp;
governments have borrowed huge amounts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.520
money like for example the the world wars&nbsp;- 1st 
World War, 2nd World War uh the way that they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.220
paid it back is essentially through inflation so&nbsp;
it's a bit complicated but you know if we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.920
huge amounts of inflation then all the prices&nbsp;
go up the debt stays the same size it becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.220
easier to pay back because all the price of&nbsp;
everything has gone up so tax receipts will go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.040
so I think markets are thinking well maybe 
there's&nbsp;going to be a big inflation to pay it back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.940
um the other thing is that this well so because&nbsp;
markets are scared of this inflation they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.900
to sell the British pound right because if prices&nbsp;
are going to go up then pounds are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.640
worth less right you know if if all the prices are&nbsp;
really high then pounds are not really valuable in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.740
the shops okay so they sell the British pound then&nbsp;
the Bank of England looks at that and says well if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.200
the pound is collapsing all of our Imports will&nbsp;
cost more, energy will cost more because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.880
our money is worth less so there's going to be&nbsp;
more inflation so in response the central bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.680
will almost certainly hike interest rates&nbsp;
massively um because they're worried about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:29.460
inflation and that's the bank of England's job&nbsp;
is to manage inflation um so then Traders said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.200
okay well if the central bank is offering very&nbsp;
high interest rates why am I gonna I'm not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.820
to lend to the government unless I get very high&nbsp;
interest rates so very quickly traders started to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:44.700
demand very high levels of interest from the&nbsp;
government um and and in fact interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.940
broadly rose in all kinds of products um&nbsp;
most importantly mortgages and that's because

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.880
financial markets and the Central Bank think&nbsp;
this government's policy will be inflationary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.780
which I agree I think it will be&nbsp;
so they're raising interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:09.720
um so lenders/traders demand higher interest&nbsp;
rates because they can get higher interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.520
um this caused basically a panic in the market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.660
um we could get into the details um pension&nbsp;
funds uh lend a lot of money to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.820
sometimes they even borrow money and lend it to&nbsp;
the government to try and make a little bit extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:35.280
bang for their buck um but suddenly the value of&nbsp;
these government loans is plummeting because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.280
lent the government at zero percent or one percent&nbsp;
for the last 15 years the amount of interest you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.760
get from the government has been very low and&nbsp;
now these guys are sitting on these very low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.420
interest loans which is actually going through the&nbsp;
roof nobody wants these very low interest loans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.260
anymore they start to collapse and then Pension&nbsp;
funds who borrowed money to buy these assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:59.700
which who's price is collapsing suddenly they&nbsp;look
like they might blow up um and the end result is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.540
the the bank of England had to come in and&nbsp;
was basically forced to come in and support

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.780
the government and and buy government bonds which&nbsp;
essentially means lend money to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.680
um but really what is the most important upshot&nbsp;
of this the most important upshot of this is

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.320
because of this crazy policy which&nbsp;
will massively increase inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.840
which will increase in inflation&nbsp;
inflation and make your life worse

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.520
inflation will rise which&nbsp;
means interest rates will rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.640
um and interest rates are expected now by the&nbsp;
market to rise very very quickly you know the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:41.040
of England base rate, the markets think it will&nbsp;
go to six percent even higher which means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:48.660
mortgages could well go to sort of seven or eight&nbsp;
percent um that'll be a disaster for the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.400
um there might be some people who say okay well&nbsp;
back in the 80s interest rates for 10 however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.740
you know back in the 80s house houses cost I don't&nbsp;
know 40 Grand you know now houses cost 700 Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:06.300
so you know you might be able to afford eight&nbsp;
percent or ten percent mortgage on 40 Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:12.000
not many people can afford that on 700-800 Grand&nbsp;
which is you know not an uncommon mortgage size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.500
in London and even outside of London there are&nbsp;
plenty of people sitting on 200,300,400 mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:25.560
um and if interest rates go up according to what&nbsp;
um financial markets and traders currently think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:33.360
they will because of this government budget then&nbsp;
when your mortgage if you have a mortgage um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.500
when the fixed term expires your interest payment&nbsp;
could well treble which means in the case of many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.060
families an extra cost of quite quite easily&nbsp;
in many cases up to a thousand pounds a month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.920
um for millions of families across the&nbsp;
country you know that is in a context of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:56.100
rising energy bills, rising food bills, massively&nbsp;
increasing inequality, massively increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:02.220
wealth of the richest which means probably&nbsp;
significantly higher inflation going forward um

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:12.780
I cannot describe how bad this will be and if&nbsp;
I'm being completely honest when I watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:19.020
budget on Friday I went I went to lunch there's&nbsp;
a little Italian restaurant down here I go to and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.840
I was thinking I was getting a lot of people&nbsp;
tweeting me saying what you know what you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.800
gonna say about it and um it was the first time&nbsp;
I've ever thought since I started this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.460
maybe it's better that I don't make a video

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:43.380
and the reason I thought that and I'm not&nbsp;
saying that's the right thing to think but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:49.380
um the consequence of this will be so bad&nbsp;
for the country and for ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.540
and for ordinary living conditions and for&nbsp;
you know poverty and rates of poverty um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.980
that I honestly thought maybe&nbsp;
it's just better people don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.420
um because you know I have been pessimistic&nbsp;
about the economy for a long time that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.500
that's how I made my money um and you know I&nbsp;
was pessimistic since the beginning of covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:17.280
um and we make a lot of pessimistic videos on&nbsp;
the channel they're often not the most positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:24.180
and I feel like it's hard you know I've I've been&nbsp;
betting on bad things happening for a long long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:32.820
time and I've been watching them happen um and&nbsp;
it's some I'm a wealthy person and it's not me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:38.100
that gets hit but it's still sometimes difficult&nbsp;
for me personally you know I've been an economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:43.200
for for nearly 20 years now and and every day I&nbsp;
look at the markets and I speak to economists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.500
I try and understand what's happening I try&nbsp;
and understand what's going to happen and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.240
try and be right and I think it's very important&nbsp;
that people try to be right I try to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.840
and you know my honest analysis is that things&nbsp;
are going to be really really terrible now and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.960
you know I've been thinking that for a long time&nbsp;
but never to the extreme situations we're in now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.120
and you know for the last 10 years and sort of&nbsp;
carrying this things are going to get worse things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.380
are going to get worse it's not easy to know that&nbsp;
things are going to get worse even if you're a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.760
rich person you're not I didn't come from a rich&nbsp;
background and it's it's people who are just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.620
me and like my family who are going to be hurt&nbsp;
um and I have to carry that around and it's fine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.620
I'm used to it but sometimes I just wonder&nbsp;
if it's right to if it's right to share that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:35.100
information because it's bad and because it's&nbsp;
not something that makes people happy to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:43.320
um so I thought about not making this&nbsp;
video um and just taking a bit of time away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.660
but at the same time you know I said it earlier&nbsp;
on in this video this can only happen because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:57.480
people like me have not succeeded in explaining&nbsp;
well enough and clearly enough to ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.560
that if the government gives you 100 quid and&nbsp;
gives the rich 100 Grand that makes you poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:09.540
um and this is only possible because people&nbsp;
don't understand that so I can't simultaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.440
sit there and say this is happening because&nbsp;
people like me are not doing our job well enough

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.280
and not make this video um yeah I think&nbsp;
it's not difficult to make things back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.720
um you know if we want to make&nbsp;
things better all we have to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.560
be serious about measuring the&nbsp;
distribution and inequality of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:42.060
um be serious about how can we reduce that be&nbsp;
serious about how can we change our tax system so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.940
that wealth flows from the very rich to ordinary&nbsp;
families how can we make ordinary families richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.440
um so that when policies come in like the&nbsp;
economic management of Covid or like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.000
budget there's a there's a thorough analysis&nbsp;both
from professionals and from ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.620
saying what's this do for inequality and we&nbsp;
start you know really aggressively pushing for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:09.240
policies that make make the wealth distribution&nbsp;
more equal rather than less equal and I think

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.500
you know in the last few days I've&nbsp;
had a lot of messages from people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:22.020
I don't normally get messages from&nbsp;
who are worried and the reason for that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.620
the people who are going to get hit here of course&nbsp;
ordinary people are going to get hit badly but a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.280
lot of people have quite big mortgages are&nbsp;
going to get hit quite badly and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.540
people who have quite big mortgages are not from poor&nbsp;
backgrounds a lot of sort of wealthy middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:43.140
people have quite big mortgages um and they're&nbsp;
messaging me saying what can we do about this and

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.460
you know there's people who work in the media who are&nbsp;
messaging me people who work in politics messaging&nbsp;me&nbsp;

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:57.120
and what this makes me sort of realise is&nbsp;
look wealthier people have have this sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.340
politics is suddenly moving in a way that's&nbsp;
going to hit me how can we sort of move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.020
against it and I think because of that you&nbsp;
probably see a lot of pushback in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.040
you'll probably see even see a pushback from&nbsp;
conservative politicians because they and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:17.160
their families and their communities are going&nbsp;
to be hit by this problem with mortgages and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.100
firstly that creates a big opportunity because&nbsp;
you know up till now the people who've been hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.060
have been you know largely poorer people&nbsp;
but the group of people who are being hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.580
is widening to including people are not that poor&nbsp;
which means we have this opportunity to create a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:38.460
kind of a coalition alliance between poor people&nbsp;
and people who are not poor but are not super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.960
rich and maybe are more powerful and if we work&nbsp;
together we can force the government to go to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.740
back on this um and actually there's a very good&nbsp;
chance the government will be forced to go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.000
on this because if those mortgage rates rise the&nbsp;
way that I think mortgage rates are going to rise

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.720
it will be an economic disaster in the country&nbsp;
you know you know these these families don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.340
often don't have the money to pay those trebled
mortgage rates so you know they have to sell their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.100
homes you know um young people who have been you&nbsp;
know I've got friends who save up every penny you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:13.440
know sleep on their mum's sofas to save up 70 80&nbsp;
grand to buy to buy a house as a housing deposit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.860
and now suddenly because the mortgage rates they're&nbsp;
gonna need three times the deposit and they'll never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.080
get the home so it'll be a disaster um and I think&nbsp;
because of the extremity of the situation there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.880
a good chance the government will be forced to&nbsp;
row it back um but what it shows is this also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.440
shows to me that sort of richer people have this&nbsp;
sense of how can we protect ourselves as a group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.680
um and as somebody who came from a&nbsp;
poor background that now works in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.720
space with a lot of richer people&nbsp;
I worry that ordinary people who

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:51.720
often find life financially difficult are so busy&nbsp;
in a day-to-day grind that they don't realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.120
how important it is that they also as a group&nbsp;
collectively protect their political position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:05.820
um because unfortunately the reality is if&nbsp;
you know people in poorer and more average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.800
financial positions don't collectively&nbsp;
protect their financial position you reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.600
this space where governments you know I think&nbsp;
Liz Truss is worth eight million pounds um

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.080
can bring in these policies that make you&nbsp;
massively poorer um and they can try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.420
convince you that it makes you richer and you need&nbsp;
to reject that you need to push back against that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:33.660
but you also need to reach out to people in your&nbsp;
communities, your families, your friendship groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.480
educate them about what's happening and you know&nbsp;
I say it again and again please share these videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:46.320
and you know I'm not just doing this to get&nbsp;
famous on YouTube like you know I used to&nbsp;&nbsp; 

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.860
get paid more than a million pounds a year you&nbsp;
know if I wanted to make money I would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.360
stayed there you know I do this because I don't&nbsp;
want this disaster to happen I don't want it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.180
get worse and if we don't take action it will&nbsp;
get worse um and the way that we stop this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:06.480
by ordinary people you know people in ordinary
financial situations understanding we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.220
to get f*cked over here unless we start to work&nbsp;
together as a group to protect our interests um

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.660
and I would encourage you to educate yourself&nbsp;
watch the video share this channel you know if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.420
you have you know wherever it is that you you&nbsp;
go you go to football you go to church you go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:32.220
to mosque you know you go to play bingo tell the&nbsp;
people around you look this is not temporary this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.900
is getting worse and it will keep getting worse&nbsp;
unless we take action we need to understand and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.380
we need to push back in whatever way we can and&nbsp;
you know you're not completely powerless you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.200
if you refuse to vote for anyone who didn't&nbsp;
promise you explicitly we are going to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.760
wealth inequality down we are going to start&nbsp;
transferring wealth from the rich to ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.060
people then they would have to give you that&nbsp;
they would have to give you that because these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.780
guys need your vote and I know you know the vote&nbsp;
is just one thing it's there's other things you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:03.600
can do you can do community organising you can do&nbsp;
community education, you can amplify my message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.200
um but you need to do that you need to do&nbsp;
that and I know things are hard and I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.400
like when it's when you're struggling sometimes&nbsp;
just to pay the mortgage which is increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.520
going to be a problem it's difficult&nbsp;
to sort of try and take that time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.460
do that education and community building but&nbsp;
um if you don't do that this keeps happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:30.060
and this is not a temporary thing this is not like&nbsp;
a like a bounce that you come back from this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:36.840
keep getting worse unless we take action um so&nbsp;
yeah I think that's basically I think we're done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.980
I think that's covered everything I wanted to&nbsp;
say we oh I suppose I should just sort of say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.700
um I would love to do more I would love to&nbsp;
make more videos and I would love to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.140
more of the questions I get and we will keep doing&nbsp;
videos we'll keep doing more videos but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.220
I am aware that the level of size the channel is&nbsp;
now and it's growing but at the level of size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.920
the channel is now like I'm limited in the&nbsp;
power that I can like what I can achieve so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:12.060
um so I'm working also to grow the channel&nbsp;
um you know recently I got a book deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.840
penguin and hopefully that's going to give like&nbsp;
us a good chance to grow but it means also that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.840
I need to take a lot of time basically writing&nbsp;
the book um so like you know I'm not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.920
be able to do it by myself you know and I don't&nbsp;
expect you to do it by yourself either like we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.300
only make things better as as a group and you&nbsp;
know I'm going to keep working I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.160
keep doing everything I can but um yeah you&nbsp;
need to do something too and you know you

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.820
if you don't have anything else just share this&nbsp;
video send it to your friends because the bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:46.260
my voice is you know I remember back when Rishi&nbsp;
Sunak was chancellor I used to go at him a lot and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.860
you know I think people thought it was a joke but&nbsp;
I did that because I thought if we bring this guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.940
up personally he's a billionaire he's super rich&nbsp;
then it would be difficult for him politically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:59.940
as Chancellor to raise tax on ordinary people and&nbsp;
I I worked quite hard to do that because I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.240
want him to raise your taxes and I don't want&nbsp;
him to cut taxes on the rich but then you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.440
very quickly he's got a new Chancellor and then it&nbsp;
happens so we need to build our power and I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.540
to build my power and I need to build my voice so&nbsp;
you know it sounds selfish but but this is not the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.400
only thing you can do but I need you to share this&nbsp;
message so that I can be bigger so that I can try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.180
and do what I can to stop this and it's not just&nbsp;me
there's other people doing it this Tax Justice&nbsp;UK&nbsp;

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:28.380
there's Patriotic Millionaires there's loads of&nbsp;
people and if you want you can go and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.040
support them and you can donate to them you know&nbsp;
I'm not taking donations I don't need donations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:40.560
but share the message help me grow um and and you&nbsp;
know educate your friends educate your family and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.120
um and insist you know demand that wealth&nbsp;
inequality comes down it's not it's not like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.620
a cold hard fact you know inequality doesn't&nbsp;
always get worse it can get better as well and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:54.540
but if we don't make that happen then it will be&nbsp;
life that gets worse instead so I'm sorry that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.860
not a positive message um we're gonna do more&nbsp;
shorter videos I know this is a very long video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:07.260
but I felt like I deserved that length um so yeah&nbsp;
lastly just things are going to get harder and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.520
very aware that it's not me that will take that&nbsp;
hurt and I know that in many cases it will be you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.940
um and I'm sorry about that but we're gonna try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:22.560
let's make things better so good luck and&nbsp;
share the video and subscribe thank you

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.660
*are you okay?*
yeah I'm all right
