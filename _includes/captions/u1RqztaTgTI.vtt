00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.520
okay so what we're going to do today is we're&nbsp;
going to explain very precisely what is meant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.840
by the 700 billion pounds that has been given out&nbsp;
by the government since the beginning of Covid

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.680
so people who've been watching this channel&nbsp;
from the start or even in the last few months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.880
will be aware that I keep going on and&nbsp;
on about this number 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
that's been given out by the government&nbsp;
it's an enormous amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
It's £14,000 for every single man or woman&nbsp;
in the country so if you don't have your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.440
£14,000 someone else has got it, in my opinion&nbsp;
it's at the heart of this financial crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
um I predicted that because of it at the very&nbsp;
beginning of Covid I said we would get a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.160
cost of living crisis; of inflation, of increasing&nbsp;
asset prices, increasing inequality...&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
so if you understand this £700 billion then you&nbsp;
can understand a lot of what's happening...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.720
it's also an opportunity to attack the&nbsp;government, 
ask them where it is, ask them who has it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.220
because it is now held by the richest people&nbsp;in
society but if you're going to do that you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.120
to understand precisely what it's meant, we've had&nbsp;
a few questions about people saying you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.720
exactly is that number, where do you get it from?&nbsp;
&amp; we're going to explain that all very clearly today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.820
so first of all what is the 700 billion pounds? the&nbsp;
700 billion pounds is the total government deficit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
since the beginning of Covid if anyone doesn't&nbsp;
understand these terms don't worry because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.800
going to be explained very clearly it's the total&nbsp;
government deficit since the beginning of covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.080
which is also the same as the total increase&nbsp;
in government debt since the beginning of covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.460
which you can understand that's the total amount&nbsp;
of money given out since the beginning of covid&nbsp;

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.640
um it's it's a public record number we'll put a&nbsp;
little link to just a public website that shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.620
exactly the government debt so you can see exactly&nbsp;
how much has increased um and what it is is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.400
total amount of government spending over and&nbsp;
above government taxation so when the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.240
spends money but funds it through taxation that&nbsp;
doesn't increase the amount of money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.180
it just moves it around so if I come to you and&nbsp;
I tax you 100 pounds and I use that money to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.880
pay school teachers to pay doctors to pay nurses&nbsp;
it doesn't increase or decrease money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.960
it simply moves it from one person to another &nbsp;
no increase in total amount of money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.120
but when the government spends money without&nbsp;
taxing that does increase money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.600
um and I think it's important&nbsp;
to understand how that works so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.600
the first thing to understand is okay if&nbsp;
if they're spending money and they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.460
getting it from taxation, where are they getting it&nbsp;
from? now that 700 billion pounds has been funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.860
in in basically two ways so 450 billion of the 700&nbsp;
billion has been funded by QE quantitative easing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.800
um that is a term that confuses a lot of people&nbsp;
and we will explain it and the other 250 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.780
pounds has been borrowed essentially from the&nbsp;
private sector from individuals and we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.320
get into that as well this is more 450 from&nbsp;QE 
(quantitative easing) and 250 from traditional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:03.300
borrowing now let's start with the £450bn Q.E. 
because&nbsp;that confuses a lot of people and it also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.940
shows you really neatly how this leads to&nbsp;
cash accumulation by individuals in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.160
so QE which stands for Quantitative Easing is a&nbsp;
concept which has confused a lot of people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.360
I'm going to provide a slightly simplified way of&nbsp;
understanding it which I think helps understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.680
crucially how it affects the economy in society&nbsp;
so I'm gonna step forward that when you hear QE&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.460
what you should understand is that that is the&nbsp;
Central Bank in this case the Bank of England&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.580
printing money and lending it to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.720
so you should understand that the central&nbsp;bank 
Bank of England here or Federal Reserve in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.580
European Central Bank (ECB) in Europe&nbsp;
prints money and lends it to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.560
and this is one way that the government can&nbsp;
finance its spending, now I'm going to briefly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.720
elaborate a little bit on this simplification&nbsp;
because I know there'll be people who will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.700
watching will say that's not what QE is, that's&nbsp;
not how QE works but if you don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.620
this slightly more detailed explanation of QE&nbsp;
what you should keep in your head is that QE is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.260
when the Central Bank prints money and lends it to&nbsp;
the government okay in actuality what happens is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.740
the government borrows money from the&nbsp;
private sector from individuals from banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:34.500
and at the same time the Central Bank buys&nbsp;
those loans from the banks now imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.360
you are the private sector you are the banks&nbsp;
and the government borrows money from you the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.920
government borrows £100 it gives you an IOU&nbsp;
for £100... IOU £100... £110 plus&nbsp;interest&nbsp;

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.060
in a year's time then the Bank of&nbsp;England 
comes in and buys the IOU from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.940
for £100 or maybe for £101
so you lent money to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.140
and then you immediately sold that debt&nbsp;
for the same price at the central bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.600
effectively it's as if you weren't there right&nbsp;
you made the loan to the government then you got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.500
rid of the loan you're a middleman and the&nbsp;
end result is that the government owes money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.660
to the central bank and the central bank has given&nbsp;
money to the government you see what I'm saying?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.340
technically the central bank doesn't lend the&nbsp;
money directly to the government there's a middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.060
man between who basically stands in the middle&nbsp;
and takes the money from Central Bank and gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.880
it to the government but that is not particularly&nbsp;
relevant for the end result, the end result is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.560
Central Bank prints money, that money gets sent&nbsp;
to the government, the government has the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.300
so the way you should understand QE is&nbsp;
that it is Central Bank prints money and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.660
lends into the government does that make sense?&nbsp;
what is useful about this from the perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.480
of our understanding is because that money&nbsp;
has basically been magic'ed up out of nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.980
it makes it really clear how when&nbsp;
the government spends this money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.820
which is run runs a deficit, how that increases&nbsp;
the amount of money in society right so sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.160
the government I borrow money from the Central&nbsp;
Bank 700 billion pounds what 450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.200
at this point you're not affected right it's just&nbsp;
the transaction between the government and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.200
central bank but when the government then gives&nbsp;
that money out it's it's brand new fresh money in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:28.080
society and that 450 billion is created so it's&nbsp;
it's in the case of the QE quantitative easing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.560
funded deficit it's really clear how this just&nbsp;
leads to increased cash holding in society right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.260
it's couldn't be clearer really the government&nbsp;
prints it it goes through the private sector but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.640
it ends up being led to the government and then&nbsp;
the government just gives it out and I think this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.740
captures something which we spoke about in last&nbsp;
week's video the "What is Money?" video which is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.500
the Central Bank cannot give money out they can&nbsp;
only lend money but government can give money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.760
so the Central Bank lent £450 billion to&nbsp;
government 450 of the 700 and the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.080
gave that out and this at the beginning of Covid&nbsp;
that number was 250. we could see then that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.580
was going to be increased but it was basically&nbsp;
that simple understanding which enabled me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.160
make a lot of money trading at the beginning&nbsp;
of Covid because you could see okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.840
the government... the central bank has only lend&nbsp;
250 billion to the government the government's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.000
going to give 250 billion out we know someone&nbsp;
is going to end up with a ton of cash even

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.600
250 billion is still £5000 for every adult in&nbsp;the 
country right so we knew there's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.860
a ton of money given out right someone has to have&nbsp;
the money, people have more money, it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.180
push up prices, asset prices will go up and this&nbsp;
is how it was very predictable from the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.640
of covid that for example house prices would&nbsp;
increase now most mainstream economic pundits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.660
were predicting a collapse in house prices but if you&nbsp;
understood well you know the government and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.100
Central Bank together are giving a ton of money&nbsp;
out we know that actually it's much more likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.920
asset prices will increase so what is nice about&nbsp;
this QE funded money even though QE itself can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.800
be a bit confusing and I think you understand now&nbsp;
what it's meant by QE yeah? the Central Bank prints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.160
money and lends it to the government what is nice&nbsp;
about it is it creates a very clean increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.260
cash holding in society it's very clean it's very&nbsp;
clear because that money hasn't come from anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.820
it was printed by the Central Bank given to the&nbsp;
government and put out into society um so that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.160
450 billion of it and we know we know now it has&nbsp;
to be held by somewhere it's like if you pour 450&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.300
liters of water into a swimming pool you know&nbsp;
that that water has to be in there that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.900
has been poured into society and somebody has&nbsp;
to have it somebody has to have it nice and easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.280
um one little thing I will add on this is that the&nbsp;
Central Bank pays interest on that money so even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.740
though the Government and the Central Bank between&nbsp;
them have created this money, it is still basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.420
interest bearing debt because the central bank&nbsp;
pays the base rate on that money and the base&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.900
rate has gone up and up so now the Central&nbsp;
Bank actually has the pages open that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.400
another thing is this creates an interesting&nbsp;
situation where the government owes a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.080
money to the central bank and the central&nbsp;
bank is is essentially a part of government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.500
so it raises the question of is this really&nbsp;
government debt and I would say yes it should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.980
be counted as Government debt because the Central&nbsp;
Bank pays interest on it so you're paying interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.040
on it like any other debt and technically it is&nbsp;
included as part of the government debt okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.240
700 billion is the total deficit 450 billion of&nbsp;
that funded by QE we know that because that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.800
brand new fresh money that exists in society&nbsp;
somebody has to have it it's not complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.280
you follow that? the other 250 billion is funded in&nbsp;
the more traditional sense of government borrowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.820
and what that means is it borrows money from&nbsp;
pension funds from wealthy individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.560
a lot of the time you think you have money&nbsp;
in the bank your bank would actually use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.020
that money to buy a government bond&nbsp;
and will be holding government&nbsp;bonds&nbsp;

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.680
so essentially the money in your bank&nbsp;
account is used to buy government bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.280
and it's a little bit more complicated to&nbsp;understand 
now... okay is society richer now because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.560
in the case of the QE it was absolutely brand&nbsp;
new money poured into society okay now let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.260
consider what happens if the government borrows&nbsp;
250 billion and then spends it into society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.580
okay so imagine your your Society okay and&nbsp;
you've got you've got 100 pounds I walk into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.120
the room and I borrow that 100 pounds off 
you&nbsp;and I give you an IOU, are you richer?&nbsp;

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.480
not really you used to have 100 pounds now you've&nbsp;
got an IOU for 101 pounds so if you include interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.300
but then I give the 100 pounds back to you

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.840
are you rich now? see what what makes&nbsp;
society richer is not the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.200
borrowing it's the fact that the government&nbsp;
borrowed the money and then gave it back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.920
so if I borrow money from you and then give you&nbsp;
the money then you have the credit and the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.120
and I think what makes it even neater is often the&nbsp;
bank does that basically without you knowing so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.220
you have 100 pounds in the bank the government&nbsp;
comes and borrows 100 pounds from the bank and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.120
then gives you the hundred pounds which you&nbsp;
put in the bank so now you have 200 pounds in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.340
the bank so the answer is yes you're richer if&nbsp;
somebody borrows money from you and then gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:26.820
that money to you, you are richer because you have&nbsp;
the money and the credit and often all you see is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.960
an increase in your bank account because the&nbsp;
borrowing goes on by your bank your bank lends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.820
the money to government, the government gives 
the&nbsp;money to you and you are richer so it's um &nbsp;

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.780
it's not that complicated really if somebody borrows&nbsp;
money from you i.e the government and then gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.180
you the money, you double your money, does that make&nbsp;
sense to you? it's you know.. and I could do it again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.540
right you know; you've got £100 I borrow it&nbsp;
from you &amp; then i give it to you now you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.640
got £100 and £100 borrowed.. like now.. £100&nbsp;
also owed to you okay you lend me another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.040
£100 pounds &amp; I give it to you again you know so&nbsp;
of course of course that makes society richer so

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.620
basically the end point here is no matter&nbsp;
how the government funds it's borrowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.200
be it by printing money or by borrowing money&nbsp;
from individuals if the government then gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.440
that money out society has more money it's as&nbsp;
simple as that you know if I if I borrow money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.180
from you or if I print money and give money to&nbsp;you 
in both cases you end up with more money and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.840
it's important to understand that this is not&nbsp;
this is not about lending money into the system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.740
and most traditional economists when you talk&nbsp;
about people having more money they will think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.080
about increased lending this is about giving&nbsp;
this is about the government going into debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.160
and giving money into the system which means&nbsp;
that the rest of society must go into credit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.600
and must accumulate money and if anyone&nbsp;
doesn't understand that I would encourage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.380
them to go watch last week's video what&nbsp;
is money that explains very very clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.120
the monetary system is always in balance in&nbsp;
terms of who is in debt and who is in credit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.720
so there, that's what it is basically the £700&nbsp;
billion is the total amount of money&nbsp;given&nbsp;

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.900
out by the government above taxing, if the&nbsp;
government tax isn't spent that doesn't increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.640
private money holding it just moves around&nbsp;
but if the government prints and spends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.000
or borrows and spends that does increase&nbsp;
money held in society and it then becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.260
important especially if the amount of money is&nbsp;
enormous to understand who is getting that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.400
so I've said it many times before and&nbsp;I'll say it 
again £700 billion is&nbsp;£14,000&nbsp;for every adult

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.040
in the country so if&nbsp;the government 
has given that amount of money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.660
whether it's been printed or whether it's&nbsp;
been borrowed the distribution of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.320
and the distribution of money in society will&nbsp;
have changed enormously and it's important to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.720
understand anyone who has not gotten £14,000&nbsp;
richer you have effectively gotten poorer because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.480
other people have gotten richer um but yeah&nbsp;
that's it that is that is the number the number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.080
we'll put a link in the description so people&nbsp;
can see that it's increasing government debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.240
um when the government gives it out somebody&nbsp;
gets it it's it's it's not complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.060
um and if other people are getting it and not you&nbsp;
that will have social and economic consequences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.740
which we'll go into in the next video um partly&nbsp;
it's funded by QE and that's nice and simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.260
because in that case it's brand new money partly&nbsp;
it's borrowed it's funded by borrowing but in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.980
case as well it increases money held in society&nbsp;
because if somebody borrows money and gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.020
it to you then you have more money um the next&nbsp;
couple of videos we're going to go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.600
I think the other couple of important things to&nbsp;
understand which is number one who actually did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.500
get the money um we've covered it many times in&nbsp;
the channel but you know mainly in the first ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.180
video on the channel which is two and a half years&nbsp;
ago now so we probably we've got a lot of new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.320
viewers you might have seen that so we'll cover&nbsp;
that quickly and then we'll go over basically what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.700
are the economic consequences because I think the&nbsp;
way that that ripples through society is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.200
really interesting but the main point of this&nbsp;
video what is the 700 billion pounds?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.600
it is the total government deficit since the 
beginning&nbsp;of covid, part of its printed, part of it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:07.800
borrowed but all of it increases cash holdings in&nbsp;
society it's enough to give 14 000 pounds to every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.680
single adult if you don't have that, somebody has&nbsp;
that, we need to know who has it... okay that's it

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.220
money currently is flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.940
government with big powers of debt and&nbsp;
the rich would be part of money there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.260
one other thing they can do with that massive&nbsp;
amount of income they can buy your mom's house
