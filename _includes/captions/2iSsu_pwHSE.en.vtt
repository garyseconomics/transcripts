00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.000
i'm Gary Stevenson 
former trader and&nbsp;people's economist

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.800
this is Garys Economics and 
today we're going to talk about tax...

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.040
okay so today i'm going to talk about one of the&nbsp;
most common questions i get on the channel which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.400
is okay you want to tax rich people well if you&nbsp;
tax them they're just going to leave okay so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.960
this is relatively easy to deal with but before i&nbsp;
just take that question on i want to talk a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.760
bit about the fact that in a sense it's progress&nbsp;
we're even talking about this because when i first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.360
started talking about tax what i would often get&nbsp;
back is you can't tax rich people rich people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.160
the lifeblood of the economy it's very important&nbsp;
for the economy that don't tax rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
i think it's becoming increasingly obvious to&nbsp;
people that what is happening with the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
now is not working um the vast majority of&nbsp;
people want something done about inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.080
but it goes this question of&nbsp;
well maybe you can't tax them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.160
um i think it's a sign of progress that&nbsp;
people have accepted now we should text them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.880
that moves us on to this question of well can you&nbsp;
tax them and if you tax them are they going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.160
just leave basically so this idea that if you tax&nbsp;
rich people they will leave is actually based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.080
a misunderstanding essentially of what rich&nbsp;
people are so i think we have this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.160
conception that rich people are just sort of&nbsp;
really talented amazing guys who have massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.280
massive bank accounts or massive bags of cash&nbsp;
which means if you raise taxes on them they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.400
take their money to another country they can take&nbsp;
this big bag of cash and they can just leave but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.000
this is not actually what rich people are um and&nbsp;
i explained this a lot in my video what is wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040
rich people are rich not just because they've got&nbsp;
a lot of money often they do have a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.240
the main thing they have which makes them rich is&nbsp;
that they own assets um in this country the U.K.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.440
but also in most rich countries that's largely&nbsp;
property so we're talking about buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.720
this could be flats and houses people live&nbsp;
in or it could be the mortgage you have&nbsp;on&nbsp;

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520
your flat that you live in but also commercial&nbsp;
property so they'll own skyscrapers they'll own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
the shops and the restaurants they'll own the&nbsp;
buildings they'll own the shopping centres&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.320
they'll also own the land the farmland they own&nbsp;
the natural resources so you know if you see those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.480
windmills that generate electricity or we've got&nbsp;
offshore oil rigs here in this country they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.320
own all of these things the natural resources the&nbsp;
buildings the land and every single time you use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.280
one of those things so every time you live in&nbsp;
a house or a flat every time you go to work in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.880
an office every time you shop in a shopping centre&nbsp;
every time you eat food that was grown on the land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.920
you pay money to these rich people it's very&nbsp;
important understand this rich people are rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.120
because they own the assets that that we need&nbsp;
to live and once you understand this you realise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.440
that this idea that the rich will just leave is a&nbsp;
little it's a little bit ridiculous right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.280
if the rich people leave and the reason they're&nbsp;
rich is because they own all of our assets well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.640
the assets are still here and we can still choose&nbsp;
to tax those assets if we choose to um i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.440
the best example of this and um perhaps the only&nbsp;
positive thing to have come out of this ridiculous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.440
Russian-Ukraine war is that finally governments&nbsp;
decided that we're going to tax some rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.680
specifically in this case Russian oligarchs and&nbsp;
very famously they went after Roman Abramovich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.160
and Roman Abramovich he he tried to leave but&nbsp;
the problem is like he can't put Chelsea football&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.000
club in a bag and take it with him and this is the&nbsp;
fundamental problem of rich people rich people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.720
not these people are not magic you know these guys&nbsp;
are not gandalf the wizard they don't just have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
richness like in their blood they're&nbsp;
rich because they own our assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.160
and even if they leave the assets are still&nbsp;
here um and we can choose to tax those assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.240
so at the moment we live largely in a tax system&nbsp;
where we essentially allow rich people to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.280
where they live and to pay tax on all of their&nbsp;
assets where they live but we don't need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.560
that right if a rich person flees the country to&nbsp;
try and avoid tax but they still own for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.400
your mortgage or your house or the office you work&nbsp;
in the government can choose to tax those assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.560
and you might say well what if they sell those&nbsp;
assets well to be honest i think in a sense that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.480
what we want right we want you to be able to&nbsp;
own the house that you live in without having to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.520
owe a massive mortgage to rich people we want you&nbsp;
to be able to own part of the commercial property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.240
in the country and the corporations in this&nbsp;
country you know at the moment these rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.640
they own your country they own your mortgage they&nbsp;
own your house right and even if they leave they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.320
will still own your country your mortgage on&nbsp;
your house and your country can choose to tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.000
them on assets so so really it's very very simple&nbsp;
it's a question of do you want your country to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.480
owned by people who pay tax or not and if you&nbsp;
do then it doesn't matter where they go because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.960
it's it's your country and you can ask the people&nbsp;
who own your country to pay tax on those assets so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.920
um i think it's it's very very simple really and&nbsp;
i think it all comes down to this you know Roman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.520
Abramovich was not able to put Chelsea football&nbsp;
club in a bag you know and these rich people no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.000
matter where they go this country will still exist&nbsp;
and the assets will still exist and they can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
taxed here and um i think when you understand it&nbsp;
like that you realise it's actually very simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.720
of course we can tax them and that raises the&nbsp;
question well why don't we then and um you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.800
there are a lot of possible reasons why that&nbsp;
could be but i'm going to give you a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.160
suggested reasons number one rishi sonic is&nbsp;
the 222nd richest man in the country he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.640
worth over 700 million pounds his father-in-law&nbsp;
is one of the richest men in the entire world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.280
and he chooses the tax laws um the previous prime&nbsp;
minister David Cameron made 10 million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.040
within a year of leaving office and he made&nbsp;
the tax laws Tony Blair i think he's worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.360
about 100 million pounds and he made the tax&nbsp;
laws so we are putting the tax law decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.640
entirely in their hands of people who are&nbsp;
multi-millionaires or maybe even billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.200
and then they're telling us we'd love to&nbsp;
raise tax on rich people but unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.520
it's just totally impossible and um unfortunately&nbsp;
some people are believing it um don't believe it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.160
because um we can tax them it's in our power and&nbsp;
we can do it all we need is to um come together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.280
come together and all agree that that's what&nbsp;
we're gonna do so um yeah support the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:44.320
tell your friends tell your family if we want to&nbsp;
tax them we can and we really should thank you
