all right guys very very quick video this one...&nbsp;
a warning about scams in the comments of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.620
videos so um it's been happening for probably the&nbsp;
last few months now people have been um basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.380
scammers have been replying to comments to the&nbsp;
videos often they use my picture the logo of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
the channel as their picture sometimes they&nbsp;
use names which are similar to the name of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.500
the channel like it might be like Gary economic&nbsp;
instead of Gary's economics and they generally say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.900
um please message me on Whatsapp or please&nbsp;
message me on telegram please message me on Signal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.360
just basically to say this is not me um these&nbsp;are 
basically scammers I think we've got some messages&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
saying they ask people for money so um yeah I&nbsp;
never asked you to contact me on Whatsapp or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
Signal if I don't want anyone to message me&nbsp;
I'll probably say to missing my website or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
my Twitter or my Instagram which are both Gary's&nbsp;
Economics um I know there's no messaging function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.480
on YouTube but yeah I will never ask you&nbsp;
to message me on on WhatsApp on Signal on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.740
Telegram and I'll definitely not ask you for&nbsp;
money over what type of telegram or signal so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.360
just be careful there are some scammers on the&nbsp;
comments it's not just this channel I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
a problem all over YouTube we obviously&nbsp;
do everything we can to delete them if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.340
see them to report them if we see them but&nbsp;
you know they keep popping up always from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
different accounts so yeah be careful um don't&nbsp;
get scammed um and yeah thanks for your support
