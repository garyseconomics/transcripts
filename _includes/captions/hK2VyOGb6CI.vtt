00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.230 align:start position:0%
confident yeah that
these<00:08:45.360><c> things</c><00:08:45.600><c> are</c><00:08:45.680><c> going</c><00:08:45.760><c> to</c><00:08:45.839><c> be</c><00:08:45.920><c> used</c><00:08:46.080><c> in</c><00:08:46.160><c> the</c>

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
these things are going to be used in the
 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
these things are going to be used in the
future<00:08:46.720><c> but</c><00:08:46.880><c> then</c><00:08:47.040><c> why</c><00:08:47.200><c> do</c><00:08:47.279><c> they</c><00:08:47.360><c> care</c><00:08:47.519><c> if</c><00:08:47.600><c> i</c>

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
future but then why do they care if i
 

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
future but then why do they care if i
say<00:08:47.839><c> it's</c><00:08:48.000><c> going</c><00:08:48.080><c> to</c><00:08:48.160><c> go</c><00:08:48.240><c> down</c><00:08:48.399><c> that's</c><00:08:48.560><c> an</c>

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
say it's going to go down that's an
 

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
say it's going to go down that's an
opportunity<00:08:49.120><c> for</c><00:08:49.200><c> them</c><00:08:49.360><c> to</c><00:08:49.440><c> buy</c><00:08:49.600><c> more</c><00:08:49.839><c> off</c><00:08:50.000><c> of</c>

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to buy more off of
 

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to buy more off of
me<00:08:50.320><c> exactly</c><00:08:50.880><c> you</c><00:08:50.959><c> know</c><00:08:51.200><c> buy</c><00:08:51.519><c> more</c><00:08:51.760><c> exactly</c><00:08:52.240><c> and</c>

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
me exactly you know buy more exactly and
 

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.389 align:start position:0%
me exactly you know buy more exactly and
yeah<00:08:52.880><c> so</c><00:08:53.040><c> it</c><00:08:53.200><c> is</c><00:08:53.360><c> it</c><00:08:53.519><c> is</c><00:08:53.600><c> a</c><00:08:53.680><c> risk</c><00:08:54.000><c> and</c><00:08:54.080><c> it</c><00:08:54.240><c> is</c><00:08:54.320><c> a</c>

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is it is a risk and it is a
 

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is it is a risk and it is a
gamble<00:08:54.720><c> and</c><00:08:54.800><c> i</c><00:08:54.959><c> think</c><00:08:55.040><c> reminding</c><00:08:55.519><c> people</c><00:08:55.839><c> of</c>

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
gamble and i think reminding people of
 

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.269 align:start position:0%
gamble and i think reminding people of
that<00:08:56.480><c> is</c>

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
that is
 

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
that is
perhaps<00:08:57.680><c> where</c><00:08:57.920><c> it</c><00:08:58.080><c> where</c><00:08:58.240><c> the</c><00:08:58.480><c> the</c>

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps where it where the the
 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
perhaps where it where the the
sensitivity<00:08:59.360><c> comes</c><00:08:59.680><c> in</c><00:08:59.920><c> but</c><00:09:00.560><c> but</c><00:09:00.800><c> it</c><00:09:01.040><c> it's</c>

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
sensitivity comes in but but it it's
 

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
sensitivity comes in but but it it's
it's<00:09:01.519><c> a</c><00:09:01.600><c> very</c><00:09:01.839><c> interesting</c><00:09:02.240><c> phenomenon</c><00:09:02.720><c> and</c><00:09:02.800><c> i</c>

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting phenomenon and i
 

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting phenomenon and i
think<00:09:03.040><c> it's</c><00:09:03.200><c> very</c><00:09:03.440><c> unique</c><00:09:03.680><c> to</c><00:09:03.839><c> the</c><00:09:03.920><c> time</c><00:09:04.160><c> that</c>

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.150 align:start position:0%
already like watford sponsored by
stake.com<00:48:50.079><c> which</c><00:48:50.240><c> is</c><00:48:50.559><c> not</c><00:48:50.800><c> just</c><00:48:51.040><c> a</c><00:48:51.200><c> crypto</c>

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
stake.com which is not just a crypto

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
repository but a crypto casino
 

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.109 align:start position:0%

a lot of football teams now already um
 

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of football teams now already um
that<00:49:04.480><c> obviously</c><00:49:04.800><c> has</c><00:49:05.040><c> leveraged</c><00:49:05.440><c> trading</c><00:49:05.839><c> and</c>

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
that obviously has leveraged trading and
 

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.230 align:start position:0%
that obviously has leveraged trading and
has<00:49:06.720><c> crypto</c><00:49:07.200><c> exchanges</c>

has crypto exchanges
 

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.430 align:start position:0%
has crypto exchanges
so

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.950 align:start position:0%
so
yeah<00:49:09.680><c> i</c><00:49:09.760><c> think</c><00:49:09.920><c> that</c><00:49:10.079><c> that</c><00:49:10.319><c> is</c><00:49:10.480><c> there's</c><00:49:10.640><c> a</c><00:49:10.720><c> risk</c>

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that is there's a risk
 

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that is there's a risk
that<00:49:11.119><c> that</c><00:49:11.359><c> fills</c><00:49:11.599><c> the</c><00:49:11.760><c> void</c>

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
that that fills the void
 

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.630 align:start position:0%
that that fills the void
and<00:49:13.520><c> i</c><00:49:13.599><c> think</c><00:49:13.760><c> that</c><00:49:13.920><c> we</c><00:49:14.000><c> have</c><00:49:14.160><c> to</c><00:49:14.319><c> we</c><00:49:14.480><c> have</c><00:49:14.559><c> to</c>

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that we have to we have to
 

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.150 align:start position:0%
and i think that we have to we have to
future-proof<00:49:15.200><c> our</c><00:49:15.280><c> gambling</c><00:49:15.599><c> regulation</c><00:49:16.079><c> to</c>

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
future-proof our gambling regulation to
 

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.630 align:start position:0%
future-proof our gambling regulation to

make sure it doesn't
 

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
