00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.640
Today we are going to explain why wages are falling.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.160
Okay, so one of the biggest problems

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.200
with the economy in the last 20 years,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
especially the last 5 years, is that wages are falling.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.480
What do I mean when I say that?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.960
If you look at the actual nominal level of wages,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.520
basically they're stagnating.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.240
But if you look at what

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.160
you can actually buy with your wage

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.560
in terms of recently, especially food, energy, housing,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.360
especially compared to house prices, wages

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.520
have really collapsed in the last 20 years.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.040
And I think most mainstream

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.960
economists have very little interest in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.080
to say to explain why your wage has fallen

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400
so much in the last 20 years.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.520
They'll probably say things like,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.360
productivity growth is not good,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.960
productivity is stagnant.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.800
And I think if you were to buy this argument,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.840
it wouldn't really explain

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.000
why wages are aggressively falling.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.160
Because productivity,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.200
as much as it's not growing

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680
aggressively in the last 20 years,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.360
it still goes up every year.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.880
And yet,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.480
if you look at what an ordinary person

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.000
on an ordinary wage can buy,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.320
they're getting less housing,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.400
increasingly less ability to buy

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
food, energy, the real basics of living.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.720
And especially if you look at their ability

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.040
to buy assets.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.320
house prices, stock prices, wages are collapsing.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.040
Now, this is something which...

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.960
it was actually one of the first things

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.440
I ever started thinking about that got me into

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.440
thinking about wealth inequality,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280
the importance of wealth inequality.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.640
And the first thing I ever did

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.040
when I, after I quit

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.840
banking in 2014 was I made a website,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.400
the website still up, it's called...

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.240
it was called wealtheconomics.org

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.320
but we've bought garyseconomics.org.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.360
That website is still there.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.920
So basically if you want to understand this theory

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.320
of how wealth inequality

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.560
affects wages and drives your wage down,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160
if you want it in words, it's all there on the website.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.760
But we’re going to explain it to you now.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.240
All right.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240
So the first thing you need to understand

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.280
is what is wealth inequality.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800
Because often when I talk about wealth inequality

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.160
people think I'm talking about income inequality.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.880
This is not about your job. This is about what you own.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.040
Before that you need to understand what is wealth.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.560
So we've got a video in the channel called

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.960
What is Wealth that really delves into this.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.480
It's one of the first videos we did.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.640
So a lot of new people might not have seen it.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.720
So if you want a really detailed

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440
explanation of what wealth is,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.480
go back and watch the What is Wealth video.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.040
You can see me walking around the canals around here.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.280
Basically, wealth is about ownership of assets.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720
So the most obvious example

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560
for you, for most ordinary people would be

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.680
whether you own your own home or not.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.960
If you don't own your home, who does own your home?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.400
You need to account for your mortgage.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.040
So it's who owns the property

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600
after mortgages are accounted for. So if you own

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.920
a 500 grand property with a 400 grand mortgage,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640
you basically own only 20% of your own home.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.960
But what I want you to understand

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.160
is wealth is not just housing.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.840
So for most ordinary people,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.600
owning the home you live in is very difficult.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.760
most people are just trying

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.120
to pay off the mortgage on their home,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.840
trying to own their own home.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.360
But there's a ton of other wealth

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.680
that exists, which is mainly commercial property.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.160
So if you walk down the high street,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.800
you'll see shops, you'll see restaurants,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.160
you'll see bars.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400
I'm talking to you from close to Canary Wharf,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.080
enormous office buildings.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.120
if you go into the centre of London, into Soho,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.040
you'll see theatres and shopping centres

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.600
and all of these kinds of things.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.120
Who owns the commercial property?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.000
So residential property is still owned a lot

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.360
by ordinary families, but commercial property

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.120
is mainly owned

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.080
through companies,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.040
through the stock market

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.440
and is overwhelmingly owned by richer people.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600
I should also add, outside

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.480
the cities, there's a ton of commercial wealth.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.520
We still do have some factories in this country.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.600
There's a ton of farmland.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.240
There's a ton of productive equipment.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.760
There's the windmills and the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.640
power plants that generate your electricity.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.840
All of this stuff is owned by somebody who owns it.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080
Now,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.840
in this country,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.680
there still is a relatively large property

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.480
owning middle class.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.920
But in some other countries,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.080
almost all of the wealth is owned by the very rich.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.000
And if you were to go back

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.600
and look at what this country was like

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.680
100 years ago, 150 years ago,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
very few people even owned the home that they live in.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.280
So basically,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.440
you can have a few different kinds of societies.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320
You can have a society

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.720
which has a large property owning middle class,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.640
or you can have a very unequal society

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.040
where almost everything is owned by the rich.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.880
I think the best way to understand

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.920
how wealth inequality affects wages

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.200
is to consider these two extremes.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840
So let's consider first

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.960
a wealth, a relatively wealth equal economy

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.760
where most people own a decent chunk of the wealth.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.680
So what that looks like is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.400
most people own their own home,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.840
but on top of owning their own home,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.000
they also own a big chunk of the stock market.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.960
They don't have a lot of debt.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.880
Maybe they don't even have any debt.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.840
So what that means is you don't worry

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840
about paying rent on the mortgage

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.720
because you own the home you live in.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.560
And you also get this passive income

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.080
because you own the stock market.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.480
Now let's consider a very wealth unequal economy.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.040
This looks like basically nobody owns their own home.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.840
Everything is owned by the very rich.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.280
You might also have some debt

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.320
which is owned by the very rich.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.440
So in this situation,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.480
the vast majority of people, they own nothing.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.320
They basically have to work to live.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.000
If you can't get a job, then you can't live in a home.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.400
You might not even be able to buy food for your family.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.760
You very, very much need to work, to live.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.360
If you don't work, then you're going to die, basically.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.160
The flip side of that is that all of this wealth

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.640
is now owned by a very small group of families,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.200
which means each individual family

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.520
will have extremely high levels of wealth.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.200
The passive income still exists,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.920
but rather than going to every family,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.200
it's all going to Rishi Sunak’s family.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.080
Basically,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.520
this means that each one of these families

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.840
will have extremely high levels of passive income.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.400
So Rishi Sunak,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.720
if we believe the Sunday Times is worth £700 million,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.160
he'll be making about £30-40 million pounds a year,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.360
not much less than 1 million pounds a week

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.320
passive income.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.240
So let's consider these two economies now. Right.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.320
So in the first economy, the wealth equal economy.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.360
There's not a huge amount of pressure on the family

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.120
because you own your home.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.600
I own this property that I live in.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000
I don't need to buy mortgage. I need to pay rent.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.520
It's great.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.560
That makes life relatively relaxed.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.720
I also have a stocks and shares portfolio,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.920
which means I have a passive income.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.680
Every family would be in this situation.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.520
So what that means is

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.960
every family is relatively financially secure.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.840
They don't have to work

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.720
that much.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.560
When I say that, I don't mean that these guys

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.440
are just going to sort of laze around, but

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.800
it means that if they want to take time off work,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.280
they can.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.000
So, for example,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.880
if you have kids, you know, when I was young,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.680
my mum didn't work until I was 11 or 12.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.840
And then she only worked a few years

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.920
because I've got a brother and a sister.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.400
And she was raising the kids,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
she was cooking the food, she was keeping the house.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.840
And,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.520
I think a lot of people would like to do this,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.040
but they have a lot of pressure that they need to work.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.160
They need to make money.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.680
If you have a relatively wealth equal economy,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.520
people can do this.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.680
People can take time off

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.880
when they have kids or if they have

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.680
if they have

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.600
a family tragedy and they need to take time off

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.880
for mental health reasons

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.600
or if they have some creative project

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.160
they want to pursue to see if it works out.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.240
They can take time off for this.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.240
So in a relatively wealth

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.920
equal world,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.760
people don't have to work

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.920
every hour God sends

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.640
because they have

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.240
a little bit of money to fall back on.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.200
They don't need to pay the rent.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.280
They have a bit of passive income.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.280
So high levels of financial security,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.800
low levels of pressure to work, extremely long hours.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.720
People can take time out of work

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.720
at different periods in their life if they need to.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.120
Now we look at the...

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.000
oh, one other thing about the wealth equal

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.560
economy is, it's not just you

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.960
that has this financial security, right?

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.800
Everyone around

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.920
you has this financial security as well,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.720
and everyone around you also has passive

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.440
income to spend on top of their worked income.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.640
So what you have then is a large number of people

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.320
financially secure.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.280
Low levels of financial pressure

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.360
can take time off work if they need to,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.760
and they have disposable income to spend.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.400
That means if you do want a job,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.680
there's a big customer base.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.600
Now let's consider

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.840
the wealth unequal economy.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.480
So in this situation,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.080
70, 80, 90% of people own nothing.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.000
They have no passive income. They don't own their home.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.520
They need to work

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.800
and say 10%

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.840
or maybe even 5%,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.880
or maybe even in extreme case, 1% of people

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.960
are phenomenally wealthy.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.520
So here there's real desperation for work.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.160
There'll be lots and lots of people trying to work.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.360
But yet the extra problem that you have

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.480
is you have a small customer base

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.600
because there's only 1%

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000
or 5% of people who are relatively rich,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.680
only 1% or 5% of people who can spend.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.240
So you have 90, 95% of people competing

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.520
for the spending of this small group.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.840
Now, at this point,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.520
it's important to understand that there is a difference

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.640
in the spending behaviours of ordinary people

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.040
and of wealthier people.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.800
So most ordinary people,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.760
they die leaving very little inheritance.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.080
They spend almost all of the money

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.720
that they make during their lifetime.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.760
What people tend to do

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.720
is they work during their life, they accumulate money.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.920
They might even buy their own home,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.640
but they spend that money in their retirement.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.160
So by the time they have retired,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.600
they’ve spent most of their income on

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.160
everything they bought during the course of their life.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.120
And everything they saved up

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.320
goes on retirement, end of life care, things like this.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.640
What that means is ordinary people spend the vast

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.840
majority of the money

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.240
they make over the course of their lives.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.160
This is very different to the behaviour

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.680
of very rich people.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.520
Now, if you are very rich,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.240
I use them

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.840
all the time as an example, Rishi Sunak will make

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.600
close to £1 million of passive income every week.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.680
When you make these kinds of enormous passive incomes,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.800
it is basically impossible to spend

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.640
even a relatively small percentage

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.520
of your passive income.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.280
That means that even if Rishi Sunak never worked,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.680
and even if he spent £100,000 a week,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.000
he would still be spending

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.320
a tiny percentage of his income

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.640
and his wealth would be growing very quickly.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.240
The rest of his income is going on buying assets.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.280
So what you can see here

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.560
is that there's a very different

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.560
behaviour towards income and assets

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.800
between ordinary people and rich people.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.440
Ordinary people accumulate assets during their life

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.960
and then sell them back during their old age.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.080
Rich people

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.200
spend a very small percentage of their income

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.680
and just accumulate more and more assets

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.840
over time.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.840
So at this point,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.760
you should probably be starting to understand

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.880
why is that wealth unequal economies

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.360
have very low wages.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.080
In the equal economy,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.040
lots of people financially secure,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.320
not everybody needs to work,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.360
they can take time out of work if they want to.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.520
Lots of spenders,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.720
very high economic demand

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.720
for goods and services and workers.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.240
In the unequal economy.,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.480
huge number of people

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.440
absolutely desperate

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.880
to work, need to work or they'll die.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.480
Small number of people

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.280
who basically don't want to spend much money.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.000
The last thing to add to this is in a modern,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
developed high technology society.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.280
A lot of what the rich people

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.840
own is very, very productive

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.840
machinery, very high productive,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.760
what economists would call capital.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.720
You know, we're talking a lot

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.520
nowadays about AI

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.960
and how this is going to make it much easier

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.120
to run a business with fewer employees.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.200
What rich people have in a high tech economy

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.560
is enormous amounts of high

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.520
production, very productive

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.800
machinery equipment,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.200
which means that they can get a lot of stuff produced

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.640
with a very small number of workers.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.480
So what you have in

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.120
this unequal

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.440
economy is an economy with a huge amount of people

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.760
desperate to work for a tiny number of people

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.240
who spend a very low percentage of their income

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.960
and don't need any workers.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.040
This is basically a recipe for disaster of low wages.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.000
And I think if you look

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.240
both across the world we live in

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.360
now, but also across history,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.920
you will see that anytime we have created an economy

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.680
that has extremely high levels of wealth inequality

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.480
almost all the time,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.800
we have had very low wages as an outcome.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.280
There are a couple of exceptions here,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.920
which is perhaps

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.600
early USA, although it is becoming,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.360
I think, lower wages for your average person,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.880
sort of late industrial revolution in the UK.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.200
And maybe I'll do a video at some point

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.320
explaining these examples.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.280
But the general case

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.160
is most of history,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.240
most of the world today,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.480
including I would add, this country 100 years ago.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.840
Very high levels of inequality

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.720
lead to very low levels of wages.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.320
And when you have high levels of wealth

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.000
equality, better wealth distribution,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.640
like we've had in, for example,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.320
Europe in the 70 years after World War Two,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.840
then you get high levels of wages.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.120
Okay.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.480
So that is a situation.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.920
Good distribution of wealth, high wages,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.680
bad distribution of wealth, low wages.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.640
One thing I think obfuscates this, makes a little bit

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.320
harder to see is that especially in the last 20 years,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.560
we have seen this increase in wealth inequality,

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.520
especially here in the UK,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.120
but also in a lot of countries.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.720
And we have also seen that decrease in wages.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.040
It can become harder to see

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.960
because it's happened at the same time

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.720
as a broad devaluation of money.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.160
Now, this is an important concept to understand

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.680
and if you want a full explanation of it,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.760
we have a video on the channel

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.840
called Devaluation of Money.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.760
You can go and watch that,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.960
but I'll explain very quickly Now.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.160
In the last

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
20 years, 25 years,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.720
we've had a lot of inflation,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.040
especially if you look at asset prices.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.040
This to me is largely

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.160
because governments and central banks

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.800
have devalued, reduced the value of the currency.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.200
They've done that by printing a lot of money.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.000
They've done that by giving out a lot of money.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.080
You can look at our early videos on Covid.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.960
The government gave an enormous amount of money.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.480
When the government gives that money,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.480
it devalues money. And what you see is prices going up.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.640
What this means is

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.240
we've got two things going on at the same time.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.880
Number one, inequality is increasing.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.160
When inequality is increasing, wages fall,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.200
but also prices of goods and services fall

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.960
because there's very low

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.040
consumption power in the economy.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.840
The flip side is the rich

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.400
have this enormous amount of passive

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.880
income that they're using to buy assets.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.800
So an unequal economy wants assets,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.120
it doesn't want wages.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.040
So what you see when inequality is increasing is

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.520
asset prices rising quickly, all assets,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.400
housing but also stocks, gold,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:09.040
farmland, natural resources and wages falling.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.800
But if you devalue the currency

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.440
what you can do is you can push all prices up.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.280
If the value of money goes down,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.720
what you see is all prices going up.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.920
So in assets

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.320
these two forces push in the same direction.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.760
Increased inequality means asset prices going up.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.120
Devalued currency means asset prices going up.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.080
So you see asset prices going to the moon.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080
And in the last 20, 30 years

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.040
we really have seen that in basically all assets.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.640
But when we look at wages

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.440
these two forces are pushing in opposite directions.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.160
Increased inequality is pushing wages down.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.720
But a devaluation of the currency is pushing wages up,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.760
which mean the two things balance out.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.640
And that means that instead of seeing wages falling,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.720
what you see is wages

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.040
kind of flatlining

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.800
while the prices of everything else

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.920
go through the roof,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.080
such as house prices, stock prices,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.760
food prices, energy prices, natural resource prices.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.680
And this really changes the way

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.440
that ordinary people perceive what is happening.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.320
So if you didn't have that devaluation of currency,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.000
people would be able to see,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.640
damn my wage is falling, why is my wage falling?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.120
And we might be able to have a discussion about,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.560
well this is happening because of rising inequality,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.080
but because of currency devaluing.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.480
People see their wages flatlining and asset prices

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.760
going through the roof.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.240
This kind of disguises, a wage collapse

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.240
as a house price bubble,

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.360
and a lot of people perceive house prices

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.280
and stock prices going up as a sign of a good economy.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.400
So because of this devaluation of currency,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.920
what we have had is a collapse in wages,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.960
which I think can be seen in fall of living standards

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.080
and in my opinion is caused by increased

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.840
inequality, kind of disguised

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.600
as a house price and stock market boom.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.440
So disguising an economic depression in the sense

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.240
as a strong economy, as a booming economy.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.920
Okay, so what's the conclusion?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.280
If wealth inequality increases, your wages fall.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.960
What you see is falling living standards,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.200
but you might perceive it as inflation, prices

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.040
rising higher than your wages.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.560
wealth inequality has increased

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.880
massively in the last five years.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.400
That's why your wages have fallen.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.760
That's why your living standards have fallen.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.280
It's important to recognise

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.640
that once this happens, your wages fall

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.400
and asset prices go up.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.320
Then that tilts the balance of power

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.520
even further away from you and towards the rich.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.200
Because now these guys have assets

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.480
which are more valuable

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.080
and you have wages which are lower.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.920
So there's a really dangerous cyclical

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.720
nature to this,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.160
which means that once inequality gets bad,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.960
wages fall and inequality gets worse.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.920
This is what I'm really worried about.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.120
This is why I started this channel.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.560
This is what we're trying to stop.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.320
There's another couple of aspects

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.320
to this rising inequality,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.200
which I think are worth noting, which is, number one,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.360
it changes the kinds of goods and services

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.240
that are demanded in an economy.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.200
So when you have a broadly equal economy,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.400
everyone is a consumer

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.480
and economies will tend to produce

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.800
things for ordinary people

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.040
because everyone has money in their pocket.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.440
So you might produce sort of cars for regular people,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.160
good quality clothing and houses for regular people.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.520
But when the economy shifts

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.240
towards a very unequal economy,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.040
you will start to see

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.040
the economy move into the production of luxury things

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.400
and basically very low quality

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.080
things for ordinary people.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.640
So you will see that economy

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.200
start to focus on the sectors which serve

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.360
very wealthy people,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.920
such as luxury sectors, such as financial services.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.080
On top of that concentration of,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.480
in specific sectors of the economy,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.000
you'll also see

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.480
geographic concentration,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.200
which we spoke about a few weeks ago

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.560
on the Shape of Great Britain video,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.200
which is that since there’s

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.760
a large number of people desperate to work

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.160
and a very small number of customers,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.800
people will be forced to move

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.160
geographically close

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.600
to the small number of rich people,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.880
which is why you will see, in this country

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.120
we've seen a similar thing in a lot of countries.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.960
poor people flooding out of the countryside,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.400
flooding out of small cities into big cities.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.920
That means big cities become increasingly very crowded.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.920
That means rents become higher.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.240
And this just makes the situation worse.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.800
Basically, now you have low wages,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.760
high rents, people

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.680
living in crowded, polluted big cities.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.840
And basically it's a disaster. And this was

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.960
the economic dynamic, which I

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.560
recognised back in 2011, 2012,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.680
which is

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.760
how I was able to recognise

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.280
that the economy would keep getting worse.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.520
It was how I was able to make a lot of money

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.360
as a trader.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.000
And it's still in place now. You know, I think it's...

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.240
if you get the time, it's worth going back and

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.080
looking at the website I put up in 2014, it’s

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.560
ten years ago

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.880
now saying that living standards would collapse, saying

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.200
that asset prices would go to the moon

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.760
because it was true then, and it's even truer now.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.720
It's even truer now.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.920
I think the key message that I want to get down here

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.000
is that wanting to reduce wealth inequality,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.480
it's not about the politics of envy.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.480
It's not even about fairness.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.560
The reason I do this, the reason I campaign

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.760
to stop inequality from increasing,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.360
is because I do not want

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.440
the ordinary people

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.640
of this country,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.440
of other countries all over the world

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.120
to fall into desperate and abject poverty.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.240
That is what is happening.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.880
It is happening now in this country

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.760
and we get watched all over the world.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.800
People send messages all the time. It's happening here.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.320
It's happening here in America, it's happening

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.720
in Australia, it's happening here in Ireland.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.640
It's happening all over Europe.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.560
When wealth inequality is high,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.080
wages and living standards are low,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.640
wealth inequality is increasing very quickly.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.200
Living standards are decreasing very quickly.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.960
We are at present doing nothing to stop that.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.760
And wealth inequality

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.640
will continue to increase very quickly,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.600
which means your living standards

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.000
will continue to decrease very quickly.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.680
If we do not deal with growing wealth inequality,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.040
your kids and your grandkids lives will be desperately,

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.440
horribly poor.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.960
I'm not just saying that. I'm betting on that.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.640
I've been betting on it for 13 years now.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.320
I made a lot of money doing it.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.080
I don't want it to happen.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.160
We can stop it.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.040
The only way to stop it is to change the tax system.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.200
We currently have a tax system

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.680
which charges you

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.800
an ordinary working people like you 30, 40, 50%

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.280
and charges billionaires nothing.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.040
If we don't fix that, the problem gets worse.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.160
Your life gets worse, your kids lives gets worse.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.320
We need to deal with it.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.240
And the only way to deal with it is to get together

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.360
and push back.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.200
Educate your friends and your family

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.920
that the problem is wealth inequality

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.560
and the problem is getting worse.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.240
The politicians themselves are very wealthy.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.720
They're not going to fix it.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.200
I want to make them take action. I need you to help me.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.840
Support the channel, share the videos, understand

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.200
what's happening and push back. Thank you.
