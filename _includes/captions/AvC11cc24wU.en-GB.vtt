00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm Gary Stevenson former trader and people's
economist this is Gary's Economics

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.080
today we're going to talk about what the economy
would look like if we fix wealth inequality

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.040
okay if you watched my videos so far you could be
forgiven for coming away a little bit depressed&nbsp;right

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.800
i made my money by betting that the economy
would be broken forever that is going to get worse

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.560
i've explained in my other videos that if we
don't do anything about wealth inequality

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.080
it's going to get worse and worse and worse
housing affordability is going to get worse

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.160
ordinary people won't be able to afford houses
wages will stagnate and it'll be difficult to get a good job

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.840
so i get a lot of *messages* from people saying
look i like your videos but they're making me feel

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.680
bad about the future and um i don't
want to do that so i want to explain is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.920
this idea that wealth inequality is killing the&nbsp;economy
it makes some bad predictions if we don't&nbsp;do

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.920
anything about wealth inequality but what it&nbsp;also
does is open up the possibility that if we&nbsp;do

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.200
do something and we do change wealth inequality
we can make this economy work so much better

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.880
for ordinary working people and families  

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.600
now imagine a different possibility... imagine if rather 
than the rich owning  all of the wealth in our society 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400
and the rest of us having to pay them to use it
imagine if the wealth was more equally distributed

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.440
so we all owned a little bit of the property and also 
the corporations and the land this would mean that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.160
instead of ordinary working people paying a big
chunk of their salaries to the rich every month

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.400
we will be paying those salaries to each other
and we'd also be receiving it from each other

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.280
this would mean we would all have a passive income
every month that we could use to fund our lives

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.280
but not only that if the money instead of going
to the super rich is going to ordinary people

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.920
well we know that ordinary people spend the money
that they get as opposed to the rich who save it

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.280
that means that instead of the money
going up to the rich to buy our houses

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.240
it will go between ordinary people who will
then spend it again to drive each other's wages

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.040
instead of that negative spiral of ordinary people 
getting poorer and house prices going up

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.520
you'd have a positive spiral of money going in between
ordinary people driving wages up every time it goes around

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.600
now that may sound unrealistic 
but it's happened before

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.640
in the 20 years after the second world war in the 50s&amp;60s 
when we had much higher taxes on the very rich

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.080
housing was much much more affordable for ordinary people 
you could buy a house for two to three times average income 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.120
that was 50 years ago before the internet
if we were to have a much more equal distribution now

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.120
housing could be so much more affordable 
wages could be so much higher

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400
and we could have so many more options 
in how we live our lives

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.280
most importantly security would be much more 
affordable for ordinary people and families 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.560
100 years ago there was an economist 
called John Maynard Keynes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.520
he's one of my favorite historical economists
British of course like all the best economists

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.560
and he said about 100 years ago that he expected his
grandchildren would only work for 15 hours a week

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.040
obviously you'll see now that if you try and
work for 15 hours a week you're probably going

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.840
to struggle to feed your family so why was Keynes
wrong? Keynes' idea was over the next 100 years

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.640
technology would improve massively that would
mean that we could produce the same amount of

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.280
goods and services with much much less work he
thought that would mean that wages would go up

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.360
and up and up and ordinary people could afford
to work less and less and live better lives

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.600
why hasn't that happened well some economists will
tell you the reason that has happened is because

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.720
people simply want more stuff so they can't work
15 hours a week because they want more stuff

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.720
i mean those economists like most economists
probably come from rich families because 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.200
if you don't come from a rich family and
you try working for 15 hours a week

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.240
you'll probably realize you ain't
going to get much stuff at all for that

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.320
so we can understand why Keynes was wrong if we
understand the cases in which Keynes was right

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.120
because there are some people in this society
who don't even have to work 15 hour weeks

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.360
if you watch my last video 'what is wealth?' you will 
have seen that Jeff Bezos even if he doesn't work at all

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.400
will make $6billion a year and very&nbsp;wealthy
families that have wealth of say £50million

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.080
they don't have to work at all and&nbsp;they
can make £1-2million income&nbsp;every year

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:34.760
so what we have created is a society&nbsp;where 95%
of us have to work long hours&nbsp;just to get by

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.000
4.9% of us don't have to work and&nbsp;can still live
and 0.1% of us&nbsp;get millions of pounds a year

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.400
even if they don't get out of bed so Keynes was right 
we could all&nbsp;live working 15 hours a week

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.240
but instead we've chosen to give all the money 
to this small group of super wealthy families

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.400
while the rest of us
have to fight to get them to pay our salaries

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.720
so look that is the key message here right 
if you have a very wealth unequal society 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.360
even if you have great technology all of that 
technology as well as all of the land on the property

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.880
is going to be owned by the super rich 
the super rich don't like to spend a lot of money

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.120
so we all need jobs but all the wealth 
is owned by super rich people 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.520
who have machines to do the work for them
and we need to convince them to spend money on us

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.600
if that's what we do then it is inevitable
wages will be low and housing will be unaffordable

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.040
but the key message is 
it does not have to be that way

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040
when i talk about reducing wealth inequality
it's not just about making society fairer

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.880
it's about making the economy work for 
ordinary people if we were to do that 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.120
wages could be massively higher 
houses could be massively more affordable 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.960
and we could live Keynes' dream 
of being able to work 15 hours a week 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.600
but it doesn't just have to be working 15 hours a week

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.320
it would massively increase the options 
available to ordinary families you know

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.240
maybe you do want to work a 100 hour week 
but if you work a 100 hour week you'll be able to

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.480
get rich and you'll be able to live a life of luxury 
and if you want to work fewer hours

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.640
you can spend more time with your family more 
time with your kids you could spend more time

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.520
pursuing your hobbies you could spend more time 
making videos about wealth inequality on youtube 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.680
these would be options available to ordinary people 
rather than simply working

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.600
all the hours of the day 
just to take care of your family

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.600
Look, my overarching message here is
things dont have to be this way

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.920
if we don't do anything things are 
going to get worse wages will fall 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.400
houses will become more unaffordable 
our kids lives will be worse than our lives 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.040
ordinary people's finances will be insecure

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.640
we will live lives where we don't know whether our
kids will be able to have financial security or not

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.640
but if we do something about wealth inequality
it's not simply about making this world fairer

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.040
it could massively transform the economy 
and the lives of our kids

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.040
it could give them the freedom to pursue their passions 
the freedom to make money the freedom to become rich 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.040
the freedom to have nice houses 
the freedom to have secure families

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.880
This is the potential future we could have
if we fix wealth inequality

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.040
so when i make my videos 
and i make my pessimistic predictions

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:28.440
that is what will happen only if we don't do anything 
but if we do something if we fix wealth inequality

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.640
that future of wealth and security for everyone 
could be there for us

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.360
but it's only going to happen if we make it happen 
and if you want to help me do that

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.880
make sure to watch the next video 
'how we're going to make the economy change'

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.880
at the moment these guys are profiting from a crisis that's
going to keep our economy in a slump for 50 years

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.840
there is one other thing they can do
with that mass amount of income

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.040
they can buy your mum's house
