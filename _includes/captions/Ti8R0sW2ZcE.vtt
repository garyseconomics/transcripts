00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm Gary Stevenson, former trader&nbsp;
and people's economist, welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.920
back to Gary's economics today we&nbsp;
are going to talk about recessions

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.480
okay so there was a big report out by the IMF (the&nbsp;
international monetary fund) um in the last couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.240
of weeks saying that the UK is going to avoid&nbsp;
a recession and this was reported in a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.520
the media the BBC basically all the major news&nbsp;
outlets so I wanted to talk a little bit about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.440
what a recession is and really more than&nbsp;
anything why this way of understanding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.880
economy is is not very helpful and perhaps even&nbsp;
somewhat damaging so a recession is very narrowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.480
defined it's a technical economic phenomenon&nbsp;
which means two consecutive quarters of negative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.360
economic growth um for this reason I think it's a&nbsp;
little bit stupid to focus on things like narrowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.360
missing a recession right the first reason is&nbsp;
you could have one quarter of negative growth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.960
one quarter of very slightly positive growth and&nbsp;
officially that means you've missed the recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.200
it's really the difference between having&nbsp;
-0.1% growth and +0.1% growth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.400
um really in one case you've had a recession&nbsp;
in one case you've missed the recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.600
and the difference to your life is basically&nbsp;
completely invisible so this focus on whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.880
we technically get a recession or not is pretty&nbsp;
ridiculous um the second thing is that really

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.520
whether we have a recession or not it's&nbsp;
totally possible that your life is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.840
worse whilst we are technically not in recession&nbsp;
I think the best example of that is in the 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.400
crisis the recession officially ended in the&nbsp;middle 
of 2009 and yet the the 10-15 years since&nbsp;2009

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.480
have seen some of the biggest and fastest&nbsp;
falls in living standards for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.960
in the history of the country in peacetime um&nbsp;
you know in the 10 years after 2010 especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.000
after the election of the the conservative&nbsp;
coalition austerity government we saw 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.640
massive falls in living standards technically&nbsp;
that was not a period of recession and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.560
um what this connects to is something we've&nbsp;
mentioned in previous videos right which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.880
recession is only a measure of what is happening&nbsp;
to GDP which is the overall size of the economy so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.760
if you have an economy which is growing slowly but&nbsp;
becoming much more unequal you could easily have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.040
what we have had which is living standards rising&nbsp;
for the richest whilst they fall for most ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.280
people so I think this focus on a recession&nbsp;
is somewhat absurd I think it reveals the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.360
ridiculous the ridiculous or technocratic approach&nbsp;
that a lot of economists in the media have because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.200
really whether we have a recession or not it&nbsp;
doesn't make any difference, you know technically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.360
we've not been in a recession the last couple of&nbsp;
years and yet what has happened to ordinary living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.760
standards? well they've absolutely collapsed so you&nbsp;
should be focused on living standards for yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.960
for your family, your community and you shouldn't&nbsp;
really worry about whether we're technically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.280
in a recession or not, but I think what&nbsp;is 
more damaging than the basic irrelevance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.360
of whether we're in a recession, is the fact that&nbsp;
the framing of this economic crisis as a recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.400
could quite possibly lead to significant further&nbsp;
economic deterioration and the reason I say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.320
is that when you frame this economic crisis&nbsp;
this "cost of living crisis" as a recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.800
people understand that to mean&nbsp;a kind 
of temporary fall&nbsp;in living conditions&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.360
people think that recessions&nbsp;are things 
that you go through, they last a period&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.520
of time, you come out of them and then things&nbsp;
get better; that is not what is going to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.960
in this crisis right things have gotten&nbsp;
significantly worse really really quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.080
that rate of extremely rapid decline I think will&nbsp;
slow down but things will continue to get worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.640
over the next two, three, five, ten years and that&nbsp;
is because we have a fundamental problem in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.640
core of our economy, of rapidly increasing wealth&nbsp;
inequality, which is not being fixed so this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.840
not a crisis which is bad and then gets better&nbsp;
this is a crisis which is bad and then gets worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.240
and I know that for sure because you can see&nbsp;
that the massively growing problem of the wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.400
distribution which has gotten massively worse 
in&nbsp;the last 3-4 years, is not get getting fixed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.640
will not be fixed and will continue to get worse,&nbsp;
so by calling this economic crisis a recession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.760
it's as if, you've got cancer and the media is&nbsp;
calling it a cold, they're saying look you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.080
got a temporary problem, take some rest,&nbsp;
drink some water, things will get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.120
but that is not what is needed here because if&nbsp;
they say that and if you believe that then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.040
fundamental underlying crisis of growing and&nbsp;
growing wealth inequality, of falling living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.880
standards, of the death of the middle class, all&nbsp;
the things that we've been talking about on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.160
channel will not get resolved, and furthermore&nbsp;
it means that there will be no impetus to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.400
about or fix the massive amount of wealth the 700&nbsp;
billion pounds that has gone from the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.840
to the richest people in the country in the&nbsp;
last couple of years, so whenever you hear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.840
media talking about 'we're in a recession, we&nbsp;
missed a recession or we're out of recession'

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.200
ignore it and and ask them: what are you doing&nbsp;
about wealth inequality? what are you doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.920
about the massive increase in wealth inequality&nbsp;
in the last 3 years? the enormous, the fastest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.080
ever increasing wealth of the richest people in&nbsp;
the country, the 700 billion pounds that has gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.840
from the government to the richest, when you're&nbsp;
fixing these things? um yeah don't listen to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.960
media talking about recession, focus on inequality&nbsp;
because that is what's going to matter if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.360
don't fix it; things will get worse. If we do fix it;&nbsp;
things will get better, so ignore the recessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.000
follow the money and demand that your politicians&nbsp;
fix wealth inequality and that your media start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.040
talking about it more and economists as well,&nbsp;
don't let them off because they're useless, thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.560
you support the channel help us reduce wealth&nbsp;
inequality, help us prevent this economic disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.680
if we don't do anything things will get worse so&nbsp;
um we have to do stuff to make it better! thank you
