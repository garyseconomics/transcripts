00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
5 years. Um, I tried my best to let
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
5 years. Um, I tried my best to let
Labour<00:00:47.440><c> know</c><00:00:47.600><c> before</c><00:00:47.840><c> they</c><00:00:48.079><c> came</c><00:00:48.160><c> into</c><00:00:48.480><c> power</c>

Labour know before they came into power
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.709 align:start position:0%
Labour know before they came into power
that<00:00:48.879><c> there</c><00:00:49.039><c> was</c><00:00:49.200><c> going</c><00:00:49.280><c> to</c><00:00:49.360><c> be</c><00:00:49.520><c> big</c><00:00:49.760><c> problems</c>

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be big problems
 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.869 align:start position:0%

funding, big problems of inequality and
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.270 align:start position:0%

they<00:00:54.719><c> ignored</c><00:00:55.039><c> it.</c><00:00:55.760><c> So</c><00:00:55.920><c> they</c><00:00:56.160><c> are</c><00:00:56.320><c> not</c><00:00:56.800><c> unlucky</c>

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
they ignored it. So they are not unlucky
 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
they ignored it. So they are not unlucky
in<00:00:57.520><c> the</c><00:00:57.680><c> sense</c><00:00:57.840><c> that</c><00:00:58.480><c> the</c><00:00:58.800><c> economic</c><00:00:59.520><c> problems</c>

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
were unpredictable. But where they are
 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.710 align:start position:0%
were unpredictable. But where they are

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
will continue to fail on the economy and
 

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
will continue to fail on the economy and

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
they will lose to the far right. And I
 

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
they will lose to the far right. And I

probably we won't win them. If we don't,
 

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.390 align:start position:0%

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
then that leader will fail on the

then that leader will fail on the
