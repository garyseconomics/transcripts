00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.600
Today we are going to do the fourth part

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.720
of our online course about inequality and the economy.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.320
And we are going to explain

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.840
why wealth inequality is a central problem.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.640
Okay. So we're back on the course again.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.720
So far we've had three episodes.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.200
Episode one was What is Wealth?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.840
Episode two was What is Wealth Inequality

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.760
and How Does It Affect The Economy?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.440
And episode three was

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.800
If Inequality Is So Important,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.240
Why Don't Most Economists Talk About It?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.560
Today we are going to explain

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.360
how I came to travel from

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.800
being a classically trained economist,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.200
I did my undergrad at London School of Economics,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.880
and then I went to work in the city

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.560
to believing

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.280
that, basically, contrary

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.800
to most mainstream economic opinion,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.760
wealth inequality

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
is actually the central problem

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.320
that we're facing right now.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.640
Okay, so I studied economics from 2005

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.240
to 2008 at London School of Economics.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880
It's a very elite economics university.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.000
It teaches economics in the classic way.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.760
It doesn't look much at inequality.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.040
So when I started my first job

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.400
outside of university,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.840
which was as a short

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840
term interest rates trader at Citibank,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.880
I wasn't really thinking about inequality

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.600
or distribution at all.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.760
I started working full time as a trader

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.520
in June of 2008,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.280
which is obviously just before the Lehman crisis,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.680
and a big part of my job and the job of my team was to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.920
look at central bank base

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.480
rates, central bank interest rates.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.680
So, for example, in this country,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.800
the Bank of England, in the US,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.040
the Federal Reserve and say, okay, what are they now?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.840
What are they going to be in one years

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.880
time, in six months time, in two years time?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.280
So this is kind of what you would call like

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.960
a macroeconomic analysis job in a way.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.520
The central bank is supposed to control inflation

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120
basically when the economy is weak, they cut the rates.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.400
When the economy is strong

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.520
or when the economy is overheating,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.080
from an inflation perspective,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.960
they increase their rates.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.000
So really what you're doing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.080
is you're looking at the economy.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.400
Is it going to be strong? Is it going to be weak?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800
That was my job. That was my team’s job.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.280
I started there in June 2008,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.840
which obviously is a few months

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.800
before the Lehman crisis.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.120
In October 2008, the crisis sort of slowly bubbles.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.680
In October it explodes.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.800
Lehman goes under.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.360
There's this massive economic collapse.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.760
I guess some people who watch the channel now

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.600
might be too young to remember that!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.960
There was this huge economic collapse.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.000
Tonnes and tonnes of people lost their jobs.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.400
It was an economic disaster.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.960
And central banks all across the world,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.920
including in the US, here in the UK,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.360
Europe, Australia,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.760
they all suddenly slashed their interest rates

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
down to zero.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.720
This was like a really extreme measure at the time.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.640
So we're doing this video in the beginning of 2025.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.280
We had zero interest rates quite recently,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680
but at the time in 2008, zero interest rates,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.560
they were like totally new.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.440
Except for in Japan,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.000
which they’d been happening for a while.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.920
Like before the crisis, central banks

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.520
would move interest rates from like 5.5% to 5.25%.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.800
It was really that kind of like

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.480
delicate fine tuning.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.280
And then suddenly in 2008, you have,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.200
oh my God, this is such a disaster.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.160
They're being cut from like 5.5% to 0%.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.520
Well, technically 0.5%, but this...

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.080
this kind of thing across the world,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.600
effectively from 5.5% or 4.5%

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.680
down to 0% in a matter of,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.240
you know, a couple of months,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.240
massive, massive aggressive cuts.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.320
So our job then as interest rate traders,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.200
from the perspective of predicting

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200
is to look at the economy and say, okay,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.240
well how long are these rates going to stay at 0% then?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.800
When are they going to come back up?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.240
How quickly will they come back up?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.120
What level will they go back up to?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.840
And at the time,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.120
because the interest rates

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.040
had been cut so aggressively,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.440
and most of these

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.000
traders are aware of the basic economic theory,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.680
probably worth covering what economists think here.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.680
So this response, which happened in 2008,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.160
basically the exact same response

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.040
we had in Covid, right, slash

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.400
the interest rates, pushed the interest rates down.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.760
This is a very classic modern economic response, right?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.280
This is how modern economists

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.680
want to manage the economy.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.840
It's all about interest rate management.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.280
There's an economic weakness.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.520
You reduce the interest rates

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.960
and the economic theory is quite simple right.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.720
Interest rates are lower.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.600
You're not making any money for saving.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.480
You can borrow cheaply. It's the same for businesses.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.600
There's no point saving money. You can borrow cheaply.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.680
Go out and spend.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.600
Go out and spend money.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.600
Borrow money, invest, build up your business.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.840
Borrow and spend, it’s free, super cheap to borrow. And

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.240
bear in mind, right before

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.160
2008, we would cut the rate from 5.5% to 5.25% and

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.280
expect that to make like a significant difference, right.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.920
So we believed and, economies still do believe,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.880
that these small interest rate

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.440
changes make a big difference to the economy.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.680
And during 2008, we had these massive changes.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.480
And the general economic consensus on

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.880
that was and still is,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.000
these stimulate the economy,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.520
but it takes a bit of time,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.000
takes generally

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
they like to say 18 months, a year

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.920
and a half, takes that sort of time

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.880
for these interest rate movements

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.200
to affect, influence the economy.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.360
So when we had these massive,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.560
massive interest rate cuts,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.760
everybody was saying like,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.800
oh my God, like, this might be too much.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.560
We're going to see like a massive economic bounce back.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.760
You know, you might see a spike in inflation.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.360
People were even talking about hyper inflation.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.880
And speaking

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.920
now in 2025,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.680
I think you have to point out that a lot of this

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.360
narrative was quite similar

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.920
to the narrative during Covid,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.640
which is when you have these massive,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.080
massive movements in interest rates.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.400
They're so economically stimulative

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.520
that we are going to see like a massive bounce back.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.320
And, you know, people now

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.080
might not remember the media during the 2008 crisis,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.520
but they'll probably remember

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.960
media saying during Covid,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560
we're going to have a roaring ‘20s.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.600
There's going to be all this pent up demand.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.480
In a lot of ways, it was quite similar.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.600
People were saying these massive moves in interest

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.240
rates will cause massive economic stimulus.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.440
And basically

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.360
when you're a trader,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.640
you can just look at the markets, right.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.280
And the markets will say,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.040
we think interest rates next year will be x, right.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.120
So interest rates

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.280
went down to like 0.5% here in the UK.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.960
Pretty much the same in the US, Europe.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.600
And you can say what would they be next year?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.960
What will they be in two years time?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.760
And everybody was like,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.960
well we're gonna have such a big bounce back

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.880
that these interest rates are going

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.080
to come massively up.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.600
I was really young, I was only 21...

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.640
well I turned 22, during the Lehman crisis,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.880
very young,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.440
naive, inexperienced trader,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.360
fresh out of university studying economics.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.080
So I just...

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.320
you just... you kind of accept it, right.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.400
I was busy, you know,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.960
trying to make money in other ways.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.640
There was a lot of sort of kind of easy money

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.840
to be made at that time in my area.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.000
And I just kind of accepted,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.600
I wasn't really getting too involved in, you know,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.320
looking at these economic predictions

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.440
and like most 22 year olds

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.720
fresh out of economics university,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.520
I thought, well, yeah, they’re probably right.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.840
They probably know they're talking about.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.560
And I expected, like everybody else, rapid recovery,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.680
rapid bounce back in interest rates.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.520
Obviously, we know now that didn't happen.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.120
So I sat through 2009

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.560
and the interest rates didn't go up.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.760
And people were kind of saying,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.960
well, you know, it takes 18 months.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.880
So, you know, this was a particularly bad crisis.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.760
Maybe it's going to take a little bit longer,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.280
give it a bit more time.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.960
So we get to the end of 2009

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.520
and the narrative is kind of unchanged.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.920
Okay, we were wrong, rates haven't gone up yet,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.200
but next year rates will definitely go up.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.720
Obviously again, we know now

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.200
we sat through the whole of 2010

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.440
and rate stayed 0% all across the world.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.400
And you know, I'm getting a bit older,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.840
getting a bit more experienced by the end of 2010.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.280
I would have just turned 24

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.880
and I've got a couple of years

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.600
experience as a trader now.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.960
We get into the beginning of 2011

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.000
and a lot of people don't remember this,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but there was a kind of mini inflation crisis in 2011

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that was quite similar in a lot of ways,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.400
although less extreme

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.320
than the inflation crisis we had just after Covid,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.360
which was inflation shot up,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.880
it was much higher than the 2% target,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.000
I think, going up in this country to nearly 6%.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.640
I don't think ever quite hit 6%.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.160
It was driven primarily by energy and food,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.240
similarly to Covid.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.120
So we had this inflation

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.800
crisis coming in in the beginning of 2011,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.760
and then people were like,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.800
well, this is really going to be it now, you know,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.480
we not only have

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.280
we got all this money flooding in and governments

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.920
are running a massive deficit, similarly to Covid.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.920
We had this quantitative easing programs

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.880
which are designed to push

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.120
even more money into the economy.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.920
So you've got zero interest rates, quantitative easing,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.960
massive government deficits,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.040
just like Covid,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.800
all this money

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.440
getting pushed in, so much money getting pushed in

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.160
and now you're starting to see inflation go.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
And everybody at the beginning of 2011 was like,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.760
well now it's really, really going to happen.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.680
And by then I was 24 and I'd witnessed,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.120
you know, two and a half years,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.480
three years really of like really,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
really bad

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.000
economic predictions by not just the traders, like,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.120
this is pretty much a broad economic consensus.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.920
You’re always going to get a few people who disagree.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.280
But most traders, most economists

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.600
said the same thing throughout.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:41.800
You know,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.080
they didn't predict the 2008 financial crisis.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.400
There was this famous moment

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.640
when did you know the Queen visited LSE,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.760
did you hear about this?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.560
The Queen visited LSE

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.520
and, just on some sort of visit,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.560
and she asked one of the professor,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.800
so why didn't you predict the economic crisis then?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.480
Yeah, 2008 crisis comes,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.440
you know, some sort of lone voices called it,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.040
but in general, the economic establishment

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.920
hadn't predicted it.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.640
Definitely nothing of that scale.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.960
2009 big recovery didn't happen.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.360
2010 big recovery didn't happen.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.840
We’re sitting at the beginning of 2011

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.520
and everybody's like,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.840
now we're going to have a massive recovery.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.480
And I had started to become

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.560
like very cynical, basically.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560
I was making a half million

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.360
pound a year

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.600
in my early 20s,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.040
and people around me are obviously making millions.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.560
And you see them just consistently wrong.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.200
You start to get to know these guys. And I was lucky.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.080
Like, I worked with some really smart people.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080
But if you...

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.240
the majority of the people

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.080
on the trading floor, to be honest,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.920
these are just basically guys from rich families.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.560
And I think if you come from a rich family,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.360
it's kind of the norm to end up at an elite university

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.640
and get a job like something on the trading floor.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.400
So you know, you sit there two and a half years,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.240
you start to realise, like, actually

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.880
most of the guys making these calls, the economists,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.200
the traders, and they're consistently wrong.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.720
They've been wrong here for like three years. And,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.120
you know, my job was

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.720
to be a trader,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.160
so if you can out predict

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.920
these guys you can make a lot of money.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.880
So I'm not going to pretend

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.240
that my motivation was at all altruistic.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.400
It was like,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.120
you know, here I am, top degree from a top university

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.320
on one of the biggest trading floors in the world.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.400
And you start realising,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.520
these guys around me, they just wrong.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.200
They just wrong. They're wrong every year.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.240
And you start realising, well,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.280
I'm in as good a situation as anybody

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.680
to figure out why these guys are wrong, basically.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:36.880
You know,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.400
I've got the elite degree just like everybody else.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.040
You know, I'm in the best place.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.400
These are the top paid economists.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.320
These are the top paid traders.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.920
And they're wrong.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.640
So it was actually really exciting,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.560
this exciting realisation

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.160
that you're here

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.680
on the cutting edge of like a really important thing,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.840
like economics and everybody's wrong.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.960
So we need to figure out why they're wrong.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.360
Because if we can, we can make a ton of money.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.920
So I started to think a lot about, okay,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.400
well what's the theory?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.600
And I'll explain the theory to you,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.200
which is low interest rates get people spending

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.800
because it's cheap to borrow money.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.160
There's no point saving money.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.400
So people should be spending

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.840
and all the economic theory says

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.920
that people should be spending,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.960
people should be spending, people should be spending.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.360
And yet there I was, early 2011,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.960
and people were not spending.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.840
So there's...

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.520
what you can do then, and what I was able to do is,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.400
you can kind of boil down

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.040
this really important economic problem of

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.800
why is the economy like consistently sh*t?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.640
To a much more objective answerable

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.000
question of why aren't people spending money?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.200
And I spent a lot of time

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.720
thinking about that simple question of,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.800
why aren't people spending money?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.200
And, you know, I was young, I was 24.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.560
You don't know that much when you’re 24.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.880
I just went and started asking people,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.120
and I think this is where I had quite a big advantage

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.760
over a lot of other economists, a lot of other traders,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.320
because I come from a poor background,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.720
I was just a lot closer to just ordinary people.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.920
And, you know,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.360
if you ask ordinary people, and I did

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.600
and I think this is a really useful thing to do,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.920
if you ask them, why don't you spend more money?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.560
You know, the answer

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.560
then was exactly the same

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.080
as what the answer now would be.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.280
The vast majority of people just said, well,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.000
I don't spend any money

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.440
because I don't have any more money.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.680
Most people were basically,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.600
you know, money in, money out, you know,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.840
very often money in was less than money out.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.200
You know, they were struggling to spend money.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.520
And I think this is where my experience was different

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.320
from a lot of economists and a lot of traders,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.680
because if you were to ask people

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.000
from rich families that,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.840
they can't say that

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.720
and they wouldn't say

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.760
they that, it wouldn’t makes sense to say that.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.800
Most people from rich families,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.480
they're not constrained by their income.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.000
Their income is more than their expenditure.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.240
They save every month.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.440
So what I was seeing was, I think, the correct answer

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.840
to the very simple question,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.800
why aren't people spending money,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.920
which is the core question of why is the economy weak,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.160
which was that people didn't have any money.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.440
And that sat in my head for a bit.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.600
And at the time I was working with, I had hired,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.480
a junior trader, an Italian guy.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.760
He’s in the book, so I can't use his real name.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.840
In the book he’s called Titzy.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.720
Really smart kid, Italian kid,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.320
went to Bocconi which is basically the Italian LSE,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
and I sort of like, I poke this question around at him.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.560
Okay, well why why maybe people don't have any money.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.480
And he would say,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.720
and we would discuss the fact

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.120
that it's kind of impossible

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.440
for nobody to have any money.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.520
And we've done videos on this channel

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.280
about what is money, this kind of thing.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.880
Money is basically a spreadsheet.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.840
There's winners and losers.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.360
It has to balance out. It has to add up.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.440
That is the way our current monetary system works.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.240
It doesn't make sense to say, like,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.320
nobody has any money.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.240
And furthermore, beyond that,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.000
like other than money, there exists real wealth.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.640
You know, we covered it on part one, What is Wealth?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.000
And, you know,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.640
the wealth wasn't disappearing, you know.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.160
The houses are still here, you know,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.320
the resources are still here,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.680
the businesses are still here,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.720
the buildings are still here.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.920
And that's what most of wealth is.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.360
So, you know, the wealth is not disappearing.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.720
Somebody has to have the money.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.640
And yet when you ask people,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.400
why don't they spend money?

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.840
They're like, well, I don't have any money.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.000
And this kind of didn't make any sense.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.440
And that was bouncing around in my head, early 2011.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.160
And then I got called into a meeting.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.240
So I was still a junior traded then, but I used to...

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.600
the previous manager had allowed me to come

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.320
to like the meeting

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.920
of all the senior managers to bring the sandwiches.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.360
So I was able to go to these like quite senior

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.320
economist meetings,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.000
and a really good Citibank economist...

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.440
I'm sometimes quite mean about economists,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.320
but there are good ones.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.640
And I thought this guy was a good economist.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.440
He showed us all these slides

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.160
going through the fiscal situation,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.800
the financial position

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.920
of a lot of major world governments.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.480
So you probably remember maybe some people don't.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.040
In 2011,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.280
after this meeting,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.120
there was a crisis of the financial position

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.640
of major European governments,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.000
and it was centered on

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.520
Italy, Greece, Spain,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.840
Portugal, Ireland,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.680
were the ones who were central in it.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.840
Before that crisis blew up, this guy kind of spotted

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.480
oh this could blow up.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.200
And he said, well,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.640
if you look at all of these countries,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.000
they're spending more than they make every year.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.280
They're having to sell their assets,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.400
they're going into debt.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.720
And it wasn't just those countries

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.480
that were central in that 2011 crisis.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.680
The situation in the UK was not much better.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.200
Situation of the US, not much better.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.800
Situation in Japan, not much better. So

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.680
what you have here is basically governments

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.120
also can't spend because they don’t have any more money

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.080
and they're running their wealth down.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.680
And that really reminded me of

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.040
when my friend said, we don't have any more money.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.920
You know, I didn't...

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
I didn't just accept that face value.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.080
I kind of dug into a little bit

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.920
where I could

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.800
and what I kind of found was the big,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.320
the big problem for my friends and their families was

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.280
the kids couldn't

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.400
see how they would ever be able to afford a property.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920
And what's important about that

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.280
is so, I'm 38 now, In 2011, I was in my mid 20s.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.960
Our parents generation, you know,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.920
even my parents, I come from quite a poor background.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.080
They all own property.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.480
You know,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320
I went to grammar school,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.680
so I didn't know like the poorest people.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.240
But, you know,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.040
most of my parents generation, they own property.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.240
They own property. And yet my generation

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.840
could in many cases never afford to own property.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.880
So what you are seeing

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.120
there is the families,

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.520
ordinary families

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.960
going over time

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.400
from being property owning to not property owning.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.560
And I think once you understand that,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.480
it doesn't make any sense to really ask the question of

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.520
why don't you spend more money?

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.560
Because what you recognise

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.080
then is these guys, their wealth

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.120
trajectory over

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.600
time is going down to zero,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.200
which means the family as a whole

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.440
spending more than their income.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.200
And if you're already spending more than your income,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.600
you can't long term spend more.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.000
And then I went into this meeting about governments.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.680
And it's basically the same.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.600
Families spending more on their income,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.200
losing their assets, going into debt.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.480
Governments losing their income...

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.600
spending more than their income,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.760
losing assets, going into debt.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.760
And the thing...

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.240
you might think

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.800
I came out of that meeting thinking like,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.480
oh my God, like, this is a disaster,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.600
Western countries are going to collapse.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.920
But what was really in

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.920
my head was the kind of systemic impossibility of this.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.840
It's not possible

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.960
for everyone to spend more than their income.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.280
It's not possible.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.480
As a society. Spending and income has to be the same.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.680
You can only consume what you produce.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.920
This is, this is the way that it is.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.240
And it's not possible for everybody to go into debt.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.360
And we've done videos on this, videos on this,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.200
but and you can go look at them.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.080
But if one group goes into debt,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.200
some group must be accumulating

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.080
credit, like this has to balance out.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.920
And it's not possible

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.360
for everybody to lose their assets.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.320
Not unless there's been an earthquake,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.040
which they hadn't been.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.400
You know, the assets that existed. Right.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.880
So I was just sitting there and I was thinking,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.680
people aren't spending

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.000
because they're losing their assets.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.280
Which means they’re actually spending more

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.360
than they can possibly spend.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.440
Governments aren't spending

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.680
because they're losing their assets,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680
which means that they're spending more

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.720
than they can possibly spend in the long run.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.080
It just doesn't balance.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.920
It's not possible. Where are they?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.160
It was as if everything was like being taken by aliens,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.400
you know, as if all of the assets.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.760
And then obviously

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.160
I'm sitting there on the Citibank trading floor

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.800
as somebody who had been paid nearly £500,000

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.800
the previous two years surrounded by millionaires.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.400
And then you just suddenly realise like,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.520
oh my God, like

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.280
we are the balance or the balance is us, like and

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.080
and not just us.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.120
Because of course, you know,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.720
whilst we were rich people,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.880
the people whose money we moving

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.960
are even richer people.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.200
And you start realising,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.480
oh, and you know, at that time, similarly to now,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.240
the stock market was ripping to all time highs

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.200
and you were starting to see like house prices

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.840
starting to move

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.360
and the gold price was starting to go

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:44.960
and you starting to...

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.120
and I suddenly realised, like

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.880
the reason that families are losing their homes

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.080
and the reason that governments are going

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.240
bankrupt is because the wealth

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.040
that used to be being held

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.320
by ordinary families and by governments

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.920
is being transferred to the rich and the super rich.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.320
And once I realised that,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.880
I realised immediately

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.160
that is a problem which would worsen over time,

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.920
because if families and governments

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.800
can't afford to run a balanced budget

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.600
when they own their own properties,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.160
when they have some wealth,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.320
well, they definitely can't afford

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.360
to run a balanced budget

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.720
when they don't own the property

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.320
and when they don't have wealth,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.520
because now they've lost that passive income.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.720
They need to pay to rent those things.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.160
And if the rich can afford to outcompete the middle

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160
at this lower level of wealth,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.400
well, now they're richer.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.360
They've got more passive income,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.360
they can out compete them even quicker.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.080
So you can see very quickly this, this core problem.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.920
And this is the really core problem, which is...

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.680
should be spoken about a million times

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.760
more than it is,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.160
which is as inequality gets bigger,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.240
the passive income that

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.240
the rich receive will get bigger.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.360
The passive income that the poor spend will get bigger,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.320
and the rate of increase of inequality

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.120
will increase over time.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.120
And this will just,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.560
not only will this get worse over time,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.000
it will accelerate in a kind of what

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.080
a mathematician would call an exponential fashion. And,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.960
you know, this was all going through my head,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.720
like sitting there on the trading desk.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.800
And of course, I've thought about it

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.680
a lot more now, so I can kind of explain it clearly.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.720
What hit me there as a trader was

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.600
this gets worse forever.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.400
This gets worse and worse and worse

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.560
and worse forever and ever and ever.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.160
And at that time,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.600
the beginning of 2011,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.920
as I explained a little bit earlier,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.760
everybody was like,

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.200
this is the year that the recovery really happens.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.920
This is the year that the rates really go.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.480
And I was sitting there

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.360
early 2011 saying with everybody saying, this is it,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.200
this is the recovery, this is the recovery.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.680
And I had just become almost certain

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.760
that the economy would collapse forever.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.040
And this might sound callous,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.040
and I think it's written very well in the book.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.600
I realised,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.920
oh my God, I could make so much f**king money here.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.240
because everyone is wrong and not only that,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.800
they probably won't figure it out for a long time.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.920
They'll be wrong next year

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.520
and they’ll be wrong

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.160
the year after, and they’ll be wrong the year after.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.400
Because at the time I'd been to LSE, right.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.640
And I,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.080
you know, and I was

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.480
after LSE you go into trading

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.640
and are surrounded by economists

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.880
and the kids that come in on the grad scheme,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.440
they're all of the top graduates

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.400
from all of the top economics

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400
uni’s across the world, right.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.960
So you're very plugged in to what economists are saying

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.400
and what economists are thinking.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.200
You get all of these emails from economists,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.760
you all these economics calls.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.840
So I knew what the economists were thinking.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.480
Nobody was talking about inequality.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.800
Nobody was talking about inequality at that time.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.160
And I was like, this is why they've been wrong.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.400
This is why, this is why they're consistently wrong.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.360
And I mean, it made sense

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.600
because if they are consistently wrong,

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.520
which I think was obvious even in 2011,

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.600
but should be even more obvious now, it’s

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.400
because they're missing a big thing.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.880
And I've been to universities,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.800
I knew that they weren't looking at this thing

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.720
and it had just become...

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.920
the penny had dropped for me.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.400
This was it, this is the big thing.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.040
They're going to miss it.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.280
They're not going to catch it.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.800
And I put this massive trade on that rates

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800
and stay zero.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.960
I basically made a tonne of money

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.760
that year basically betting

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.200
that the economy would be a disaster.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.160
And obviously that was one year, 2011.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.000
So you, you’re not...

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.200
I was quite confident in that.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.720
I was confident enough to bet a lot on it,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.880
but I wasn't immediately

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.200
like 100% certain I was right.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.440
And you can never be 100% certain.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.360
But then you go into the next year

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.040
and the same thing happens the next year.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.920
You're like, well,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.120
everybody’s saying there’s going to be recovery,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.480
and you're saying there’s not going to be a recovery

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.960
because the inequality is getting worse.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.720
And then you start to,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.240
you start to think about other things.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.280
You start, for example, I start to think, okay, well,

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.440
if there is a big increase in wealth inequality

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440
that is underlying

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.480
the reason that markets are wrong on interest rates

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.320
and also the reason why economists

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.600
are wrong in their predictions,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.760
maybe the market's wrong on other things.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.720
So I started to think, well,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.080
what would it mean for asset prices more broadly

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.360
if inequality would increase?

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.120
Well that's quite an easy question right.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.480
Because we know

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.160
ordinary people

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.960
tend to spend money on goods and services,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.120
rich people tend to spend money buying assets.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.360
So if inequality increases, you would expect to see

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.480
asset prices rising while

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:20.920
goods,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.600
services, wages,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.880
what we call CPI inflation

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.480
because CPI doesn't look at assets,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.400
sort of dicks around at the bottom.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.720
And at this time...

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.680
and then I was like okay,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.240
well the asset prices are going to go,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.560
stock market is going to go.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.160
And that again

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.680
people...

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.360
the economy was so weak in 2011,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.720
we had this big sovereign debt crisis

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.120
and we had more austerity.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:40.840
The economy was so weak.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.640
Everyone was like, stock market is going to be s**t.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.560
But I was like, no,

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.600
if I'm right on this,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.200
stock markets will go, because the economy being s**t

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.040
if the...

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.880
if the economy is s**t because governments are in debt

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.920
well who are they in debt to?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.480
That again itself is a manifestation of inequality, right.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.560
So I said, stock prices will go up. And then they did.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.160
And I said,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.400
well you'll get asset price inflation combined with

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.880
disinflation for the poor. And it did.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.080
And what you start seeing is this,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.320
this understanding of inequality,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.880
it seems to explain all of the incorrect predictions.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.840
And then you start being able

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.200
to predict everything correctly.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.200
And I think that is the big giveaway.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.120
I think when you understand...

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.280
you know,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.280
I think it would be easy to turn around and say,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.440
oh, you're just mad. You know, you're just pessimistic.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.800
If I'm pessimistic, why do the bets keep being right?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.720
You know, if this is just pessimism,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.040
why do the bets keep being right?

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.560
And, you know, I consistently made money betting on

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.880
the economy staying weak.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.040
Markets continue to predict

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.680
interest rate normalisation way beyond that.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.160
2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.000
Rates in this country stayed zero,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.560
and there would be a few times

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.560
you would see rates pop up and the predictions pop up.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.360
And I would just go back in and bet,

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.080
because I knew you can't,

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.320
if you don't fix this fundamental problem,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.600
you're not going be able to fix the economy.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.400
And this simple way of understanding it, which is that

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.680
the growth in wealth inequality,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.880
not income inequality, wealth inequality

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.120
is being missed.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.440
And you start being able to

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.040
predict everything correctly.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.200
This one simple idea

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.240
that inequality is at the center,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.840
that it is driving living standards

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.120
down, has enabled me to correctly predict

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.160
the weak recovery from 2008.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160
The cost of living crisis during Covid.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.800
Stock price rally in the mid 2010s.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.400
Stock price rally after Covid.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.960
Collapse in living standards.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.680
The collapse of central political parties.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.920
The rise of the far right.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.840
Like I'm not Mystic Meg here. The theories right?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.800
The theory is right

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280
and it's not being looked at.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.080
And if we don't take action on it,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.960
it will get worse and worse and worse and worse.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.200
So that's it, I think that is why

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.440
inequality is the core central problem.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.280
I would encourage people to care about it

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.840
because if you don't take action on it,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.800
it means living standards

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.280
getting worse and worse and worse.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.680
And we will talk in our next video

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.800
about how do we fix it.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.000
So thank you very much.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.160
