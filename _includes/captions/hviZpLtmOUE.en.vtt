...what I want you to understand and what I&nbsp;
want you to think is whenever you hear in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.100
the media the term 'Fiscal Black Hole' I want&nbsp;
you to hear fiscal enormous pile of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.560
because it is not possible for debt to grow&nbsp;
without private wealth growing and whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.940
anybody asks you 'how do we pay the debt&nbsp;
back?' I want you to turn around and say to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.920
them 'where has the money gone? who has&nbsp;
the money now? why don't we tax them?'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
okay I'm back today we're going to talk&nbsp;
about Debt and the Fiscal Black Hole

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.760
Just as we predicted in the very first video on this 
channel "how&nbsp;the rich get richer from covid-19" 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.640
government debt has increased massively in the last
3 years&nbsp;also as we predicted at the beginning of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.340
channel that is now being used by the conservative&nbsp;
government to justify a round of austerity cuts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.480
this is gonna mean less money for public&nbsp;services; 
hospitals, education, police, local services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
um these are all things which have&nbsp;
already been massively cut in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.440
David Cameron/George Osborne&nbsp;
government 2010 to 2016.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.700
In many cases these services are already cut
to the bone, cutting them further is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.520
decimate services it's going to be less money&nbsp;
in your pocket if you work in the public sector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.300
um there's really a risk it's going to really&nbsp;
threaten the fabric of our country our basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.020
services um and throughout all of that is going to&nbsp;
be justified by the idea that there is an enormous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.160
government debt an enormous fiscal black hole so&nbsp;
it's very important that you understand debt we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.100
going to explain that today okay so government&nbsp;
debt the government debt has increased since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.420
Covid from £1.9 trillion to £2.5 trillion, now 
I think these really big numbers like trillions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.580
they're very very difficult to understand so&nbsp;
I think the easiest way to understand the size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.100
of the government debt is to look at it on a&nbsp;
per person or a per adult basis so the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.140
government debt has increased to about 
£50,000 for every single adult in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.520
okay so that's a lot, that's a big number, 
£50,000&nbsp;how do we understand that okay

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.720
the first thing is that government debt is not &nbsp;
the only kind of debt that exists in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.920
um there's also significant amounts of individual&nbsp;
debts the most obvious is Mortgage Debt so lots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.960
of people have a mortgage maybe you have a&nbsp;
mortgage the average amount of mortgage debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.880
held by a UK adult is £35,000 so that's on&nbsp;top
of the £50,000 of government debt and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.220
there's also other debts; student debts, 
consumer&nbsp;debts, which add up to about £5,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.100
per adult in the country so for every adult&nbsp;
in the country you've got £50,000 of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.520
government debt £35,000 of Mortgage Debt&nbsp;
another £5,000 of other debts um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.380
so what is the total amount of debt per person in&nbsp;
the whole country if you add up everybody's debts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.400
you might think 50 add 35 add 5 that's 
£90,000 per person but what if I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.260
to tell you that the total amount of debt in the&nbsp;
whole country is exactly zero exactly £0

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.120
you might think okay that doesn't make sense&nbsp;
there's all these debts how can I add up to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.060
well if I wanted to work out how much debt you&nbsp;
were in it wouldn't make sense for me to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.460
look at your mortgage right if you have a big&nbsp;
amount of money in a savings account I should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.320
take your mortgage and I should also subtract&nbsp;
your savings rights so let's say you've got a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.460
£100,000 mortgage but you've also got 
£50,000&nbsp;in savings your total debt it's not&nbsp;

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.380
£100,000 right it's 100 minus 50 that's £50,000 
well whenever you have a debt it's&nbsp;very&nbsp;

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.900
important to understand that that debt is&nbsp;to
somebody the money that you owe is money that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.300
is owned by somebody that you owe the money to so&nbsp;
what that means is if we look at everybody's debts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.740
and also everybody's credits (money owed to them)&nbsp;
it always must add up to zero it absolutely must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.580
because if you owe money then you must owe that&nbsp;
money to somebody if if you didn't owe that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
to anybody, then you wouldn't have to pay it&nbsp;back
right, nobody would complain that is the way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.480
debt works debt is always money owed by&nbsp;
somebody to somebody else what that means is

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.400
all of this debt that exists in the country 
£50,000 per adult of government debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.900
£35,000 of Mortgage Debt 
another £5,000 of other debts

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.700
this £90,000 of debt per person must be owned&nbsp;
by someone which means the average amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.680
money that you control owed to you must be&nbsp;
£90,000 pounds per person I think this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.540
I think this is kind of mind-blowing when you&nbsp;
think about it because when you think of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.600
mass amount of government debt £50,000 per&nbsp;
person that massive amount of Mortgage Debt

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.800
£35,000 per person all the debts every single&nbsp;
debt you have every single debt everybody you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.800
know has everybody's mortgages is owned by&nbsp;
someone and the total amount of debt must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.640
zero because if you owe it, somebody owns it. your&nbsp;
debt is an asset to somebody your debt is wealth to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.780
somebody your debt is wealth owned by somebody&nbsp;
so the reason that I point this out is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.540
some of the ways that this debt crisis&nbsp;
have been described in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.380
are totally insane so we talk about&nbsp;
a black hole a fiscal black hole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.920
so if the government has generated a fiscal black&nbsp;
hole which the implication is the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.720
has generated an enormous debt, it must be, it&nbsp;
absolutely must be that somebody has generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.980
a fiscal massive f***ing pile of cash it's impossible&nbsp;
for it not to go like that and this is exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.520
what I said in the first video on this channel if&nbsp;
you haven't watched it please go and watch it how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.200
the rich get richer from covid19. I said&nbsp;
that Covid will cause a massive increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.800
in government debt and exactly mirroring that and&nbsp;
offsetting it a massive increase in private wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.280
owned by rich people and if you think about it&nbsp;
it is not possible for those two things to exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.740
without one another they are the same thing if&nbsp;
there is a massive increase in government debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.520
then there must be a massive increase in private&nbsp;
wealth in fact the increase in government debt is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.080
the increase in private wealth and the increase&nbsp;
in private wealth is the increase in government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.200
debt the reason that the rich have got richer is&nbsp;
because the government owns the money the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.220
the government got have got poorer is because&nbsp;
they're running their own money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.720
it's so important to understand&nbsp;
this because the media descriptions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.280
are insane it's not a black hole it's a transfer&nbsp;
of wealth from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.140
and if we wanted to fix this crisis we&nbsp;
could easily do it by taking the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.500
back from the rich it's still sitting in&nbsp;their 
bank accounts back to the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.600
there was an article out a couple of weeks ago&nbsp;where 
the head of the IFS (The Institute of fiscal&nbsp;studies)&nbsp;

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.760
uh which looks at government finance in&nbsp;
this country I think his name was Paul Johnson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.380
said we've all got a lot poorer&nbsp;
we've all just got a lot poorer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.760
um I think he was referring to this increase in&nbsp;
government debt and if you sit think about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.980
it's an insane statement because if the government&nbsp;
has gotten poorer by giving a crap ton of money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.800
then we as a whole haven't got poorer right all that's&nbsp;
happened is the government has given money to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.140
people of the country we as a whole have not&nbsp;
gotten poorer the problem is that all of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.300
money that's been given out which is £600 
billion&nbsp;so far since the beginning of Covid

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.920
£12,000 per adult in the country has&nbsp;
been accumulated by richer families and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.300
richer households so really we as a country&nbsp;
have not gotten poorer at all all that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.660
happened is there has been a massive transfer&nbsp;
of cash from the government to the rich so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.720
what I want you to understand and what I want you&nbsp;
to think is whenever you hear in the media the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.260
term Fiscal black hole I want you to hear fiscal&nbsp;
enormous pile of money because it is not possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.080
for debt to grow without private wealth growing&nbsp;
and whenever anybody tells you how do we pay the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.360
debt back I want you to turn around and say to&nbsp;them 
where has the money gone? who has the money&nbsp;now?&nbsp;

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.960
why don't we tax them? because the reality&nbsp;
of the situation here is that £600,000,000,000&nbsp;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.020
which has been lost by the government is exactly&nbsp;
pound for pound offset by 600 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.840
accumulated by the rich of this country that is&nbsp;
how debt works you cannot owe debt to nobody if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.000
you have increased your debt by 600 billion pounds&nbsp;
someone has increased their wealth by 600 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.880
pounds that is twelve thousand pounds per adult&nbsp;
if you do not have your £12,000 somebody&nbsp;has it&nbsp;

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.880
and it is in most people's cases the rich&nbsp;
that have that because we can see statistically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.040
that that money has been accumulated by the rich&nbsp;
if you don't understand why go and watch the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.260
video on this channel how the rich get rich from&nbsp;
covid-19 which predicted exactly everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.580
has happened; that government debt would increase,&nbsp;
that private wealth of the rich will increase, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.900
inflation would increase, that asset price would
increase, that house prices would go up and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.820
we would see a massive crisis of inflation and&nbsp;
living standards this was exactly predictable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:00.840
because during covid £600 billion went&nbsp;from
the government to the rich so you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.120
understand that is not a black hole that is a pile&nbsp;
of money sitting in the bank accounts of the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:12.180
austerity is not an unavoidable choice it is&nbsp;
something that we are choosing to do because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.340
the government which is currently ruled by a man&nbsp;
whose father-in-law is one of the richest men in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.680
the entire world is choosing not to tax the rich&nbsp;
who have just seen the biggest and fastest ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.140
increase in wealth but instead to raise your taxes&nbsp;
to cut your pay and to cut your public services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.740
every single pound in that fiscal black hole is&nbsp;
sitting right now in the bank accounts of the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.740
if we took that back there's no need for austerity&nbsp;
if we took that back we could give every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.140
adult in the country £12,000 imagine that 
£12,000 in your bank account that is not making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.480
the rich poor that is just making them exactly&nbsp;
as rich as they were three years ago before covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.760
every single thing that is happening here was&nbsp;
predictable at the beginning of covid if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.840
understood the massive increase in inequality&nbsp;
and massive cash transfer that would go from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.880
the government to the rich if you don't believe&nbsp;
me go and watch my first video how the rich get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.480
richer from covid-19 because everything that&nbsp;
has happened I have exactly predicted would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.360
happen this austerity is not essential there is&nbsp;
no fiscal black hole every single pound needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.440
by the government is held by the rich and&nbsp;
this austerity is a choice but a government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.960
led by one of the richest men in the world we&nbsp;
don't need to do this we don't need austerity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.960
every time you hear fiscal black hole think fiscal&nbsp;
pile money if anybody questions you send them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.700
this channel show them this video make them watch&nbsp;
the first video how the rich get rich from Covid 19&nbsp;

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.640
Austerity is a choice while you are struggling&nbsp;
to feed your kids and heat your homes the rich are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.920
getting richer at the fastest rate in history&nbsp;
we could stop this at the drop of the hat if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.500
we chose to tax the rich and we have to do it&nbsp;
thank you like the video share subscribe thanks

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.560
money currently is Flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.640
government with big powers of debt and the&nbsp;
rich would be part of money there's one other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.420
thing they can do with that mass amount&nbsp;
of income they can buy your mom's house
