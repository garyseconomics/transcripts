00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
I wanted to do

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.760
a video about a concept

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.760
which I’ve been calling the illusion of improvement.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.760
This idea is about a kind of a philosophical question,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.560
which is can it be possible

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.480
for every single individual in a society

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.000
to be getting richer over time,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.640
and yet for society as a whole and for families as a whole

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.840
to be getting poorer over time?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
And this is an important concept,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.120
I think, because

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.560
in my opinion, definitely people in this country,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.320
the UK and many Western countries

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.720
have been getting continually poorer

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.120
for at least the last 20 years or so.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.600
And yet if you look at most individuals,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.400
you will find that over time

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.840
they do tend to get richer over time.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040
And that is because in most careers

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.120
you get salary rises as you get older

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.400
and many people are able

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000
to accumulate a little bit of cash and buy property,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.760
which makes them richer over time.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.240
So how is it possible that these two things

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.400
simultaneously are happening,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.040
that individuals are getting richer

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.360
and yet society as a whole is getting poorer?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.080
So I think the best way to explain

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.400
what's happening here is through a graph.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.200
Now, we don't do many graphs or diagrams of this channel,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.320
but I think this diagram here expands really nicely

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.400
what is happening.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.240
So on this graph,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.520
you've got time on the x axis

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.720
and you got living standards on the Y axis.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.160
So what you have is four separate generations over time.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.880
And if you look at these four generations, you can see

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.760
each generation over time is getting richer,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880
but their children

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.200
are also getting richer over time,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.560
but from a lowest scoring point

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.480
and reaching a lower end point.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.560
So each generation over time is getting poorer,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.000
but each individual person is getting richer.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.320
And I think this describes really well

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.800
what is happening now.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
And the reason I wanted to talk about

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.160
this is because another thing

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.520
which I've been talking about on the channel

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.000
is we have seen in the last

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.720
15, 20 well, to be honest,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.200
30 or 40 years a very aggressive increase

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.040
in house prices and other asset prices.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520
And I suspect we will see very aggressive

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.440
house prices in the next few years.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.280
Now, what is interesting about this is this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.520
this economic action, the increase of house

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.160
prices,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.400
it really bankrupts families over time

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.960
because each generation finds it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.720
harder and harder to buy a house.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.960
They have to pay more rent.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.360
They have to pay more interest

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.000
because they need bigger mortgages.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.880
But if you look at individual people,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.840
they will normally tell you when house prices rise,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.000
it's good for me.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.600
So we have an action which is impoverishing families.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.640
And yet most individuals within those families

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.200
think this is good for me.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.240
So I think it's really important

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.560
for people to understand this diagram, essentially.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760
What is important to understand

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.320
is if you want to understand how your family is doing,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.440
how your community is doing, how your society is doing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.360
financially, it's not enough to look at just yourself

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.680
and your path over time,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080
or even you and your kids and your path over time.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.480
What you need to do is compare

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.680
your kids to you at their age

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360
and your grandkids at their age.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.280
So if we go back to the graph,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.160
if you look at the living standards for young people,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.760
so I'll put XXXX’s in the graph here,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.600
which marks each generation when they were young,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.640
And you can see that each generation

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.280
when they were young is getting poorer over time.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.040
If we do the same thing for middle age again, middle aged

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.400
people are getting poorer over time.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.240
The elderly again getting poorer over time,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.440
despite the fact that each individual generation

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.840
is getting richer over time.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.000
It's very important that you do this

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.960
if you want to understand

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.360
the future of your family and your communities,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.120
you need to compare generations

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.280
when they were the same age.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.200
So I think

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.440
once we understand

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.600
this, we can start to sort of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.560
get rid of the division,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.840
which is increasingly happening

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.200
between elderly and the young when it comes to voting.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.520
I think elderly people see that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.360
their lives are getting better over time.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600
They assume their kids lives will get better over time.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.520
And they fail to realise that despite things like

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.720
increasing house prices which

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.600
benefit them but hurt their kids,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.360
the long term trajectory,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.080
the long term

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.880
trajectory for their family, for their kids,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.320
for their community is increased poverty over time.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.040
Now, that raises an interesting question,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.000
which is well,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.560
if all families, or the vast

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.600
majority of families are being poorer over time,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.400
but society as a whole is not getting

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.880
poorer, GDP is not decreasing,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.360
then where is all of that missing wealth going?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.360
And to explain that, we're going to add

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.000
one other line on this graph here,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.160
which is the living standards of the rich over time.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.440
So as ordinary families are getting poorer,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.640
they're losing their wealth,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.920
the rich are getting richer at the fastest rate

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.400
ever in history and their living standards

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.320
are dramatically increasing.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.960
So what we have

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.360
is quite an interesting situation,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.120
which is from a class perspective, ordinary families

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.920
are basically being impoverished by the very rich,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.240
but the rich are able to convince ordinary families

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.320
that they're getting better

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.880
by creating this illusion of improvement,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.080
which is every single generation, year by year,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.720
feels like they're getting richer and every family

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.480
generation by generation is being made poorer.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.440
So that's it basically.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.720
This is the illusion of improvement.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.160
It's really important to understand this

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400
because in the next 10, 20 years,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.280
house prices are going to go through the roof,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.600
and especially of older generations

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600
who maybe own property

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.120
are going to feel that they're winning

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.040
and they're often going to fail to realise

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800
that the consequence is their kids

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.080
and their grandkids are being made poorer.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.440
If we can get enough people to recognise this,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.720
then we can get together. We can say we don't accept this.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.040
We don't accept the situation

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.760
where wealth flows from ordinary families

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.640
to the very rich, where living standards

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.640
continue to decrease over time.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.920
If we don't realise this,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.480
then it will happen and we will fall into a situation

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.040
where the vast majority of families

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.400
fall into poverty over time.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.160
We can reverse it.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.080
The only way to do that

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.160
is by making rich people pay their fair share

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.080
instead of taxing

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.520
everybody who's working hard for their money.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.120
We're going to keep pushing for it. We hope you support us.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.160
Watch this video again.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.120
Share it with your friends, Share it with your family.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.760
Send it to your mum, send it to your nan.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.480
Let's fight back.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.520
Let's not accept poverty for ordinary people. Thank you.
