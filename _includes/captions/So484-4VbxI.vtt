00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.920
...but if we were to see 
Wages fall by seven times,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.240
people would be out in the streets rioting, 
saying “Oh, it's economic collapse”

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.600
but if you see House prices 
rise by seven times, people say,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
“Oh my God, 
the economy is so strong!”

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.640
Okay so the devaluation of money is a 
big feature of our economy for the last

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.040
20-30 years, especially 
the last three or four years.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.040
It's going to continue to be a big feature of 
our economy for probably a long time to come.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.720
It's very often misunderstood.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.280
If you want to understand what is happening 
and what is going to happen,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.360
you need to understand it.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.320
So I think the first thing we 
need to talk about is basically

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
what is meant by the 
‘devaluation of money’?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.000
It can be a little bit of a 
confusing concept, right?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.200
Because I think a lot of us have 
deeply internalised the idea

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.040
that the value of money is constant.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.960
£1 is worth £1, $1 is worth $1.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.120
If the price of things in the shops go up,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
we tend to think that's the price
of the things changing.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.160
We don't think that the value of money is changing
and this is basically completely incorrect.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080
The value of money is very volatile.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.440
It changes a lot. In fact,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.080
systemically, we have we have 
designed our economic system

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.280
to basically ensure that the 
value of money falls over time.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.000
What does this mean and 
how can you understand it?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.880
So I was a foreign exchange trader
for a number of years

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
from 2008 to 2013-14.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.600
And when you offer an exchange traded,
you're literally sitting there

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.440
and you're seeing all of the different currencies
that exist in the world.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.840
Every currency,
every country has its own currency.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.560
And you're seeing the different prices of the
different currencies move up and down over time.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.480
So if you watch the business news,
they might say the value of the pound has fallen

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.080
1% against the value of the dollar.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
It has fallen to one and a half percent
against the value of the euro.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.800
And this is one way of understanding
that the value of of money and of

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.280
different currencies is not constant, different 
currencies are going up and down every day.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.640
Sometimes they can move really big amounts, like
when Brexit happened the value of the pound fell.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.840
Something like 10-15% against the dollar
and the euro in a very short period of time.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.160
So this is your first indicator
that the value of of money is not constant,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.200
but actually

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.720
money is even more volatile in its value
than you might think.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.400
If you just look at the foreign exchange markets.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.240
And the reason for that is very often
the different

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.560
currencies of different countries move together.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.200
So in my opinion, in the couple of years
after COVID,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.240
what we saw was a simultaneous devaluation
of a number of currencies.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.440
At the same time,
the value of the pound fell, the value of the euro

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.560
fell, the value of the dollar fell,
the value of lots of currencies fell.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.240
Now, if the value of the pound
and the euro fall together

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.240
and you are accustomed to valuing 
the pound by looking at

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.240
how much it costs in terms of a euro,
then you won't see that movement.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.840
Imagine the value of the pound and the dollar
and the euro all fall at the same time.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800
If you look at the value of the pound

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.880
in terms of euros, in terms of dollars,
you might see that it's constant.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.160
So what's happened there is money
has been devalued and you have not seen it.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.640
So what does it mean to you
and how would you see it if the value of a number

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.200
of different currencies or all of the main
currencies fell at the same time?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Because you wouldn't see it in foreign exchange
markets, right?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.640
Well, if that happens, what you see

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.760
is the price of a wide variety of goods

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.560
and services, wages, asset prices going up

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.760
because those prices are valued

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.360
in terms of pounds or euros or dollars
that are going down.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.120
So essentially what i'm trying to explain to
you, what i'm trying to get you to see

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.600
is that the devaluation of currency

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.640
can be seen as inflation.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.240
In fact,
I'd probably go so far as to say

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.640
inflation and the devaluation of 
currency are the same thing.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.640
And it's probably worth sitting and thinking
about that for a while because it's not

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.040
I think it's not something that we take in easy.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.520
I think a lot of us have 
deeply internalised this idea

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.920
that the value of money is constant,
and if the price of, say, a carton of eggs

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.800
or house or milk in the supermarket goes up,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.920
then it is those things that have changed.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.240
But in actuality,
when all of the prices go up together,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.720
it's much more likely
that the value of money has changed.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.640
And I think during COVID,
what we saw was a really interesting situation

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.760
where governments all over the world
printed and gave out enormous amounts of money.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.760
So the UK government gave out £700 billion.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.680
That's £14,000 per adult.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.000
The US government gave out $8 trillion, which is

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.960
$25,000 per person in the country

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.240
and immediately afterwards
we saw all the prices go up

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.440
of basically everything and very 
few people in the media said

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.760
whats probably happened is money
has been devalued, even though I think that's

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.880
very likely that the most likely cause.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.160
So what I want you to understand
is that the value of money is very,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
very volatile, very, very variable.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.160
It tends to go down over time.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.360
And we don't necessarily

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.600
see that in foreign exchange markets
because the different moneys

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.720
and the different currencies
tend to move together.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.560
And when that happens, different money,
different currencies being devalued together,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.560
what we see rather than moves 
in the foreign exchange market,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.640
what we see is inflation.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.440
So next what I you to understand

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.440
is that this process

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.360
the continued devaluation of money

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.280
by inflation as inflation you see it as inflation
but they are in fact the same thing is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.240
an intentional, purposeful, designed
aspect of our economy that we live in.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.640
So the central banks, the Bank of England,
the Federal Reserve in the States, European

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.000
Central Bank, the basically the government bank,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
which is trying to manage your economy,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
intentionally targets positive inflation.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.120
That is basically the consensus of mainstream

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.920
economists nowadays because 
we want to have inflation in general

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.640
they don't want to have inflation
as high as it is now.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.640
Inflation is still above 10% in the UK.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.200
It's not far below
that In a lot of other countries.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.880
Economists tend to want to have inflation
of about 2-2.5% percent a year.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.840
So what that means is

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.640
economists want money to be devalued by two,
two and a half percent.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.040
this is part of the way
our economic system is designed.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.160
The constant,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.080
hopefully, according to most economists,
gradual devaluation of currency.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.080
Obviously, in the last few years
it's been much more rapid.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.320
But they want that to happen,
designed intentional part of the system.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.200
Why do they want that to happen?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.200
That's quite a big question,
which will probably deal with another video.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.280
Economists think that allowing money

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.320
to be devalued or allowing inflation to be
positive is good for the economy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.960
I would argue that's probably because essentially
it enables

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.240
corporations to cut workers wages over time.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.480
It's very difficult for corporations
to cut your actual wage

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.880
because they have to convince you
to sign a new contract at a lower wage.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.360
You probably say no.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.440
But if we are automatically devaluing

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.160
money by 2-3% a year,
then your wage is automatically being devalued

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.280
2-3% a year and your company doesn't
have to actively cut your wage.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.320
In fact, you have to actively fight
against your wage being cut.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.000
So this is a bigger question,
which we'll probably cover

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
in more detail in another video but economists.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.560
want inflation to happen, which means they 
want currency to be devalued, I would argue,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.240
because it enables corporations to cut your wages,
which which they think is good for the economy.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.040
But this positive inflation
rate, this positive rate

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.160
of devaluation, of money,
of devaluation, of your wages,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.800
it actually significantly underestimates

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.000
the real rate at which money is being devalued.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.440
Why is that?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.040
So the inflation rate, which you see on the news
in this country, they normally call it CPI.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.120
They could call it a different thing.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.160
Wherever you're watching

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.080
those standard measures of inflation,
almost all of them

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.080
only look at goods and services.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.240
The prices of the things that you buy,
excluding asset prices,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.240
so excluding most obviously, house prices, but

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.240
also things like stock prices, land prices,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.600
basically the cost of any the price of any assets.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.720
Why is that relevant?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.880
Why is that important?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.520
Well, that is because in the last 20-30 years,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.160
and we cover this in more detail in the video,
‘The Asset Economy’

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.560
In the last 20-30 years, asset prices

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.080
have very consistently risen at a faster rate
than goods or services.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.880
The period where this is most obvious is the 
10-15 years after 2008, after the financial crisis,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.280
where for most of that period inflation
was quite low, sometimes as low as 1% or 2%.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.120
But asset prices

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
increased really, really significantly
over that period.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.600
It's important to realise it's not just housing.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.000
When I talk about asset prices, people

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.040
tend to think immediately about house prices
because it's the asset price that is most visible.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.440
But this was a really broad

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.440
land prices went up, stocks and 
share prices went up massively.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.680
Even things like luxury art &amp; luxury cars,
durable natural resources

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.720
all saw really significant increases in price.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.640
So asset prices are inflating

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.080
at a much faster rate than goods and services.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.680
That's not included in the inflation
rate that you see.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.120
So what that means is

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.120
the inflation rate,
which only looks at goods and services,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.240
significantly underestimates the actual rate

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.160
at which currency is being devalued.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.280
Okay, so why is this happening? now

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.440
This is something that I've been really interested
in for a long period of time,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.880
and it's something I've thought about a lot.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.400
And in my opinion, the root cause for this,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.720
the large scale, consistent devaluation of money,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.720
is growth in wealth inequality.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.520
And I will explain why.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.040
And I've touched a little bit on previous videos
that one of the key features of growing wealth

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.040
inequality is increasing asset prices

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.360
relative to wages in goods and services.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.480
The reason for this is most people

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.640
in ordinary financial positions
or poor financial positions

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.960
tend to spend all of their income over

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.040
the course of their life on goods and services.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.760
They generally die without any accumulated assets,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.760
which means that they've spent everything
on goods and services.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.120
Ordinary people buy goods and services
that drives wages.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.640
Rich people, on the other hand,
especially very rich people,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.240
tend to spend the majority
of their income on buying more assets.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.560
So that means

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.280
if wealth inequality increases in society,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.840
ordinary and poor people have less rich
and very rich people have more.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.520
Society as a whole will start to want more assets
and less goods and services.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.080
And that is because we're moving
purchasing power away from ordinary people

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.320
who like goods and services towards rich
and very rich people who like to buy assets.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.680
So as inequality increases, asset prices
naturally go up.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.280
Goods and services and wage prices
naturally go down.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.560
But if you remember,
our central banks are trying to ensure

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.880
that goods and services prices specifically

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.880
keep going up at 2, 2.5, 3% a year

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.040
because we have rising inequality.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.800
Those goods and services prices,
they want to go down because ordinary people

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.800
who drive
those prices are losing their purchasing power.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.080
That means that for most of the last 20,
30 years, central banks have been trying

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.600
to convince ordinary people to spend money
by cutting their interest rates.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.800
But remember those cutting interest rates?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.240
Not only do they drive up ordinary prices,
they also drive up asset prices for the rich.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.240
But asset prices for the rich are going up anyway

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.240
because the rich people are getting more
and more and more money.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.720
So what's happening
is this Inequality is driving down wages,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.080
driving down the price of goods and services,
and that forces action from central banks

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.720
and governments, central banks to cut interest
rates, governments to spend more money

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.680
to try and support the economy.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680
And a side effect of that is the rich get even
richer and asset prices go up even more.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.480
So there are two simultaneous things
happening at the same time

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.480
increasing inequality, which pushes

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.680
asset prices up and wages, goods and services
down, and stimulus

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.880
from central banks and governments,
which devalues currency and pushes everything up.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.760
Now, as this happens,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.880
the consequence is that the rich get richer
even more and are able to buy even more assets

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.480
from the middle class, from the working class,
which drives even further

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.240
this dynamic of growing wealth inequality,
which pushes asset prices up more, pushes

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.440
spending power down more, which means we have to
do even more and even more so in a sense,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.960
what you're seeing is another one of these
sort of death spirals of the economy,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.480
which is inequality is going up and up and up.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.840
That's forcing action from our 
economic institutions like central banks,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.280
which drives interest rates down and 
drives asset prices up even more.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.880
Now, this this is something
I started to realise in sort of 2010, 2011.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.280
I remember a conversation I had on the trading
floor with a trader who I was working with in

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.840
I think it was 2011
when he said, I'm going to sell the stock market

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.880
because the economy is very weak
and the stock market is very strong.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.880
That shouldn't be happening. I'm going to sell
the stock market is going to go down.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.760
What I said to him was, listen,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.880
stocks never go down

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.960
because when the economy is weak,
ordinary people spending power is weak.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.920
That forces governments and central banks
to pump more money into the system

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.120
that ends up with the rich.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.680
And those people ultimately buy stocks.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.120
And I think one of the most interesting
things of the last 20 years and we've seen this

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.040
really strongly in the last three years,
is that increasingly weak economies are associated

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.240
with growth in asset
prices, stock prices, house prices.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.040
I think the most obvious example of
that is the last three years, and in particular

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.160
the last one year.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.480
So in the last one year we have seen in the UK
new all time

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.040
historic records for gold price,
the stock market and house prices.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.240
You record all time highs for the three.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.360
The three significantly significant assets
are not supposed to be correlated in the time

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.960
of probably the biggest economic weakness
we have seen since the Second World War.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.760
And I think this is
because whenever there is economic weakness,

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.480
our economic

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.680
institutions, central banks and governments
respond by devaluing the currency,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.040
which tends to drive asset prices up,
which tends to support rich people.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.560
And ultimately,
as we've seen in the last couple of years,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.560
doesn't really support ordinary
working people in working families.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.320
Okay, so what's the conclusion?

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.080
Money is being consistently devalued
as a result of our economies

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.120
and our economic institutions,
like central banks and governments

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.640
trying to deal with the negative effects
of growing inequality.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.440
This will continue to happen
more and more, and it's very easy

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.440
to predictand very easy to see 
that in the next 5-10 years

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.360
we will see significantly increased growth

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.360
in house prices, stock prices, asset prices.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.280
As governments and central banks
are forced to pour loads of money into the economy

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.640
to try to rescue struggling consumers,
which ends up with the rich

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.760
driving further spiralling increases
in asset prices and stock prices.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320
I think the most important thing
to understand here is that

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.920
the institutions which we have designated
to protect our economy and to protect

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.240
working families

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.240
because of their own poor
understanding of what is happening,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.880
they are inadvertently fuelling
a fire of inequality which nobody is putting out.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.280
And just like I said, in our

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.760
death of the middle class video,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.680
we can really
there are some things which I can predict

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.320
with really, really strong confidence,
which is that inequality will increase.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.280
The middle class will cease to exist

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.120
and asset prices will continue 
to go much, much higher.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.320
And that includes house prices.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.560
The conclusion,
the effect of that on ordinary people

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.520
is that ordinary families will lose their property
and will struggle more and more to buy property

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.680
and social mobility will collapse.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.760
And we speak more about that in the asset economy.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.360
The asset economy video.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.520
So again, it's another very pessimistic video.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.360
But I think what

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480
it helps us to understand is that

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.560
rising asset prices are devaluation of currency,
which is driven

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.560
ultimately by increased inequality,
which nobody's fixing.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.240
But if we address those growths in inequality,
we can we can reverse that relative change, right?

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.120
So rather than asset prices going 
up significantly, while wages stagnate.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.360
We can we can start to see wages
catch up with asset prices, which will increase

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.240
ordinary families ability to own property, to
reach financial security and to have a good life.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.640
And those are things which are possible
if we deal with the wealth inequality

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.640
and which will not be possible if we don't. So,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.720
yes, support the channel, promote the channel,
help us to explain to people the importance

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.760
of dealing with inequality and the consequences
for ordinary families and for our society.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.800
Thank you very much.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.960
No. So
I'm not actually against the currency devaluation.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.920
I think what the currency devaluation does is

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.920
it obscures a little bit what is happening.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.440
Because

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.760
here's an interesting thing to think about, right?

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.560
In the last 30 years,
house prices have risen relative

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.960
to wages, maybe five times, five or six times.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.720
Right.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.360
And there's two ways

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.920
that an increase in house prices
relative to wages can manifest

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.720
either an increase in house prices
or a decrease in wages.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.480
Right.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.320
There is a change in the relative price.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.320
Can be this one going up or this one going down.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.880
And by manipulating

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.880
the currency, the value of the currency,
you can choose which one of those you get.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.160
So say, for example, you're in an economy where
wages were falling and house prices were constant.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.040
If you combine that with aggressive devaluation
of currency, you can bring both of them up.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.920
So instead of wages falling,
what you see is house prices rising.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.280
Right.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.280
So what is real is relative prices.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.040
But what we can affect by changing
the value of the currency is absolute prices.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.720
So we can change wages falling into house
prices rising.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.800
That makes sense. Okay.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.080
And what that

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.080
does, which I think is really interesting,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.120
is it massively changes

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.000
the perception of what's happened.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So falling wages

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.080
is very similar to rising house prices

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520
because what matters is the relative price.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.360
But if we were to see wages fall by seven times,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.720
people would be out in the streets
rioting saying, Oh, it's economical up.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.040
But if you see house prices rise by seven times,
people say,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.240
Oh, my economy is so strong.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.920
If house prices and stock prices
go through the roof.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.040
People think it's great.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.440
But if wages collapse, people think it's terrible.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.000
So I think

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.280
understanding the devaluation of currency
helps us see

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.440
what's actually happening, which is that rising
house prices is the same as falling wages.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.640
And I think it's

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.160
I think that's a really interesting thing
for people to understand that

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.920
rising house prices are
the same as fall as falling wages. So

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.320
I think

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.320
once you have the growth in inequality,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.840
then you must have the growth

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.720
in relative price of assets relative to wages

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.960
because you've shifted the spending power
to people who want assets.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.920
And then we have a choice through on wages.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.800
The full do want house prices to rise.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.640
Well, the truth is, I think house
prices are rising is less painful for society

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.080
than wages falling,
but it's still painful for society.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.800
So I think and I think this is actually something
I see a lot,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.280
both from mainstream economists
and from kind of alternative

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.840
economists on the Internet, is
they focus on problems with the monetary system.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.200
So mainstream economists will say,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.880
oh, the problem is interest
rates are too high or interest rates are too low.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.320
And a lot of people on the Internet will sell.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.480
The problem is the banking system.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.320
But very few people are looking

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.680
at the real increase in real wealth
inequality of real wealth.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.640
And I think
once you have that growth in wealth inequality,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.640
probably devaluing the

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.640
currency is the least painful way to hit society,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.920
because then you say rather than dropping wages,
we're going to raise house prices.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160
That's not to say that I think house
price rises is a good thing.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.600
What I'm saying is
the root problem is the growth in the wealth

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.320
inequality, not the devaluation of the currency.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.840
I think you had to do that.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.840
You know, if, for example, in COVID
we hadn't devalued the currency,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.360
what you would have seen is massive,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.400
massive deflation, massive collapse in prices.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.880
And I think that would have been

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920
more damaging for us.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.920
It would have been more like a Great Depression
kind of thing.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.560
I think 2008, I think really probably
the main difference in 2008

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.040
and the Great Depression,
which were both at the heart of it banking crisis,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.920
is that in 2000
we aggressively divided the currency.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.480
And that's not to say that we got good
outcomes in 2008.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.680
So a massive decrease in living standards,
but it's better than the Great Depression. So

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.360
I want to make clear the point I'm trying to make,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.360
which is I actually don't think

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.600
the devaluation of the currencies
is the core problem.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.560
I think it's the increase in inequality
that is the core problem.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.680
And if you try to revalue the currency

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.800
without dealing with the inequality,
you would actually make the problem worse.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
It's it's a little bit like you have a disease

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.440
and then you get an immune response
and then you get rash and it's your immune system,

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.560
you know, I mean,
but the problem is not your immune system.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.880
The problem is the disease.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880
The root cause is the growth of inequality.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.920
So yeah, I think sometimes
people think that I'm well,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.960
I get criticised both for being too critical of
and not critical enough of the central banks.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080
I think that the central bank
is not the core of the problem.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.960
The problem is inequality.
