00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.180
you know I I wish that I could say to the&nbsp;
viewers leave it to us I'll go I'll talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.240
the professors I'll explain to them it's&nbsp;
broken and we'll fix it these guys look

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.380
amazing man they are getting paid they're&nbsp;
not going to fix it so unfortunately you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.100
maybe people think I just say it because it&nbsp;
sounds nice you need to come together you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
to push back listen the people who are supposed&nbsp;
to be protecting you are not protecting you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.900
it's as simple as that man it's as simple as that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.140
I have another question so I mean you mentioned&nbsp;
at the beginning about different cities huh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
so there's a housing crisis in&nbsp;
most major cities yeah countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.320
by extension possibly the cost of living crisis&nbsp;
in all countries yeah so why are we so hard on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.780
our government here is it not not their fault&nbsp;
well I mean I think it's important to recognize

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.220
what most people view as a economic&nbsp;
crisis in their country is a global crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.780
you know what what really almost everyone&nbsp;
everywhere lives in one of two places a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
place where you cannot get a decent wage&nbsp;
or a place where you can't afford a home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020
you know and that covers basically everywhere&nbsp;
right um you know that's happening in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.740
country it's happening in the US it's happening&nbsp;
in German it's happening in France Italy Spain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
Japan Australia Canada you know I said yeah&nbsp;
I could keep listing these countries right um

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.100
and what is interesting is you know you know&nbsp;
we have quite a right when government in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.580
this country but there's countries that have&nbsp;
left in government so they're not fixing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.720
and you know I spoke in my video on about the&nbsp;
labor party my big fear you know I don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.840
anyone's going to be surprised here I'm not a fan&nbsp;
of Richardson the current conservative government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.400
but really at the moment I have very little faith&nbsp;
that when labor come in they will act seriously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.580
on the wealth distribution um and the consequence&nbsp;
of that will be that the wealth distribution will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.920
continue to get worse they might do some small&nbsp;
things that slow down the rate of of deterioration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.720
but it will continue to get worse and then that&nbsp;
means that living stands will continue to fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.440
and then people will start feeling like well&nbsp;
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Tories didn't fix it label didn't fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.000
it and they'll vote some crazy guys in right you&nbsp;
know um and I think what really has happened is

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.660
the sort of I think what what really has happened&nbsp;
is we've created a system in economics where all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.280
the best economists are removed on public service&nbsp;
so I think if you consider you know I was you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.060
one of the top students in my area lse and when I&nbsp;
finished that degree I had the choice do you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.200
to go into public service stay in Academia I go&nbsp;
up for the government work for the central bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.300
or join about the banking right and if I if I had&nbsp;
chosen to work in public service I'd have had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.640
do a PhD I'd have to still be studying for four or&nbsp;
five years paying to study going further into debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.160
um you know and then I'd have to work low paid&nbsp;
difficult jobs for many years before I made any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
money and even then I wouldn't make that much&nbsp;
I went and worked in the city and by 25 I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.260
a multi-millionaire you know I come from a poor&nbsp;
background you know like if people in my family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.500
need help to get Financial Security I'm the one&nbsp;
that has to help them you know and you know not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.100
just their me myself you know if people like me&nbsp;
are put in a situation where you have to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:52.560
phenomenal enormous personal sacrifice to work in&nbsp;
to work in support of the public so then what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.720
of person chooses to go into public service you&nbsp;
know you will get the occasional person who's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.280
absolutely dedicated to helping Society but&nbsp;
really more often than not you're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.000
get people who come from Rich backgrounds and can&nbsp;
afford to make that sacrifice or people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.360
in it for Prestige so the end result is or and&nbsp;
on top of that once you go into public service&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.980
they have like very very poor systems especially&nbsp;
in Academia of correctly identifying and promoting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.420
the people who are good so I think it creates&nbsp;
an inevitable basically you create a kind of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.020
Posh looking smart looking idiocracy of economics&nbsp;
where these guys are not incentivized to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.100
they're not rewarded to be right they write&nbsp;
a load of like fancy wanky papers they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.520
care if they're right or wrong you know but&nbsp;
they all get paid 100 Grand a year you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.280
and they're all from Rich families otherwise&nbsp;
they wouldn't have gone into that industry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.040
meanwhile people like me are getting paid 2&nbsp;
million pounds a year to work in a skyscraper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.820
and say nothing you know you know that is the&nbsp;
amount of money I give up to make this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.140
you know that is how much I would be making if&nbsp;
I stayed in the private sector you know so if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.000
that is the economic system you have built where&nbsp;
you specifically aggressively incentivize anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.980
who's really good to shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and never&nbsp;
speak publicly and then you create a system which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.460
is full of Posh boys which has no system of you&nbsp;
know we've been doing this for years now right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.040
you know and the predictions have all been&nbsp;right 
you know all the predictions of the mainstream

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.160
media are wrong by this time in Citibank I&nbsp;
was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] famous you know what I mean? so

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.980
if you create no systems for good people&nbsp;
who know what they're doing to challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.240
the rich privileged elites who control the narrative&nbsp;
then what could, you cannot be surprised if you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.320
a broken economy that rewards this idiotic elite&nbsp;
you know why would anything else happen so I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.160
really the problem is more than the conservative&nbsp;
government you know the problem is a problem with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.760
economics globally is massively broken it's&nbsp;
dominated by rich idiots, there's no system&nbsp;for&nbsp;

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.940
smart poor people to challenge them there's a&nbsp;
massive incentive for smart poor pe to stay out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.700
of it entirely and then in the end what you get&nbsp;
is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] university speaking teaching nonsense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.920
I can't explain to you how bad the education&nbsp;
was Oxford is criminal really how bad it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.280
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] analysis on the news terrible woeful&nbsp;
pathetic analysis these guys have no interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.100
in being right you know sycophants in government&nbsp;
who just want to line their own Pockets you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.300
and anyone who actually understands it is a&nbsp;
Trader being paid to shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.500
this is why we're in the state that really it's&nbsp;
it's much more than the conservative government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.380
it's much more the conservative government and&nbsp;
the reason why on this channel the reason why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.300
I made this channel was because I wanted a space&nbsp;
that spoke to the ordinary people who are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.240
screwed over because ultimately it is ordinary&nbsp;
people about being hurt and all of the people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.540
are being paid to protect you are being paid to do&nbsp;
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nothing you know they let this happen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.100
do they get punished did they get punished did the&nbsp;
academics get punished you know you know you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.120
David Cameron who presided over a massive decrease&nbsp;
in living standards which is so not presided over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.720
massive decrease in living standards where's their&nbsp;
punishment they've become made 10 million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.360
after that Richard Nick is one of the richest men&nbsp;
in the world no personal punishment you know so&nbsp;&nbsp;o

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.320
you know I I wish that I could say to the&nbsp;
viewers leave it to us I'll go I'll talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.260
to the professors I'll explain to them&nbsp;
it's broken and we'll fix it these guys

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.580
they get paid man they are getting paid they're&nbsp;
not going to fix it so unfortunately you know&nbsp;&nbsp;ple

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.240
maybe people think I'd just say it because it&nbsp;
sounds nice you need to come together you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.500
to push back listen the people who are supposed&nbsp;
to be protecting you are not protecting you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.060
it's as simple as that man&nbsp;
it's as simple as that so

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.980
it's not going to be easy it's not gonna it will&nbsp;
only come from a popular movement that says you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.600
idiots have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up we don't accept it we&nbsp;
need change it will only come because otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.640
they get they're making money from it they're&nbsp;
making money for me and they don't get hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.860
for being wrong they don't get rewarded for&nbsp;
being right so um you know I wish it was as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.580
simple as you know let's get rid of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;
wishes soon I can let's get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kissed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.780
armor and it's not as simple as that you know&nbsp;
there's a big systemic problem here people need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:37.080
to understand if you do not fix inequality do&nbsp;
not fix the economy so we gotta fix it thanks

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.340
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.600
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.160
and think thanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.660
