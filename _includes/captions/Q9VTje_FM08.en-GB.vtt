00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.920
Today we are going to talk about meritocracy.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.520
Okay.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.480
So today

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.680
we're gonna respond

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.240
to one of the biggest criticisms

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.760
we get for our campaign to tax wealth more,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.920
which is that's not fair.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.480
That's not meritocratic.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.360
You want to go after people who've worked really hard

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.240
their whole lives to make money,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.960
and you want to tax them more.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960
That's not capitalism, that's not meritocracy.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
So we're going to address this head on.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600
First things first,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.960
I've said it a million times on the channel.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.920
I'll say it again.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.920
We are not campaigning to tax working people.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.760
We are campaigning to tax

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.080
individuals and families who have hoarded

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.480
enormous amounts of wealth, £10 million or more.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.520
Secondly, let's talk about meritocracy in society

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.840
that we live in today.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200
So I am talking to you here from London.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.240
I grew up in East London in quite a poor community.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.200
I went to a grammar school,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.360
so I know some richer people.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.280
And then I went to a very fancy university.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.960
So I know some much richer people.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.800
And then I work in the City,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160
so I know so much richer people still,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.840
most of my friends from poorer

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.560
backgrounds are working really, really hard.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.080
I know a few of them who are earning

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.920
much, much higher than average salary.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.280
They went to some of the top

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.720
universities in the country.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.040
They're making 60, 70, 80 grand a year.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.440
They're sleeping on their mum's sofas,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.160
and they're saving up every single penny

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.880
they can to buy a house.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.080
And they can't buy a house because house prices

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.240
go up faster than their savings.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
At the same time,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.160
I know people from richer families who don't work,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
who own houses

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.640
because their parents gave them £700 grand tax free.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.840
Is that meritocracy?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.200
This is a question I want to ask you.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.080
Let's look at what's happening

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.800
in our society at the moment.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.600
House prices are rising very, very, very, very quickly.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.520
if you've been watching this channel for a long time,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.080
you’ll know I'm a firm believer

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.760
that wealth inequality drives asset prices up.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.000
If you don't understand why that is, I would recommend

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120
that you watch our recent video, part

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.600
two of our online course,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.720
What is wealth inequality

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.960
and how does it affect the economy?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.920
If you give all the money to rich people,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440
they will try and buy all the assets

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.600
and that will drive asset prices up.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.280
What that means is ordinary

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.800
people can no longer afford assets.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.840
We increasingly live in a society

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.800
where whether you are able

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520
to have things like a comfortable family

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.200
or have things like home ownership

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.480
are basically nothing to do with how smart you are,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.160
how hard you work, what job you have,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.560
what university you went to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.120
and are increasingly just a faction

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.200
of how rich your parents are.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Listen, we do not live in a meritocracy.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.240
Nothing could be more obvious.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.600
I think one problem we have is that...

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.920
So I'm 37, and my parents

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.040
generation lived in a much less unequal

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.920
and much more meritocratic society.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.800
They lived in a world

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.440
where if you worked hard, you could save up some money,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.400
you could buy property,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.840
and you could reach some level of wealth.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.200
That is not really true anymore.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.240
Younger people are increasingly seeing that it's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.640
basically impossible to get rich

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160
unless you are from money.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.800
Listen,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.760
wealth exists in our society,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240
and there are basically two ways

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.440
in which wealth can be distributed.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.480
One is through work.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.360
People who do more valuable work, more high paid work

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.720
get the assets, they get the wealth,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.040
and they become rich.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.600
The other is basically through aristocracy

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.560
and inheritance, where people who are born

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.720
which die rich, and people who are born poor, die poor.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.520
We can't really exist in a system where ordinary,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.880
hardworking people from poor families like myself

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.560
pay 50 or 60% tax if they make money.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.760
People from extremely wealthy families,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.920
like the Duke of Westminster,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.720
can inherit billions of pounds and pay nothing.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.920
This is not a meritocracy.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.280
I'm pushing for a meritocratic society.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.880
What I want is an economy

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.800
where very rich people pay

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.200
their fair share of tax

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.120
instead of all of the tax burden

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.600
landing on ordinary working

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.960
people like you or your kids.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.400
I want a meritocracy.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.120
I want people who work hard to make money.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.320
Unequal societies are not meritocracy.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.800
They are societies in which people from rich families

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.120
get all the assets.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880
If you want meritocracy,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.200
you should tax the rich rather than working people.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.480
So that's my answer. How do you get meritocracy?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.640
You tax the rich.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.240
That way

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.560
we can get the assets to ordinary working people

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.720
rather than just the people with rich dads.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.120
That is a meritocratic society.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.520
