00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.520
um yes i've seen the comments on a lot of the&nbsp;
videos yeah sometimes people um seem to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.440
they think i should be wearing some gold&nbsp;
trainers or something um but yeah look for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.000
obviously you grew up with me so you know sort&nbsp;
of what it was like for me growing up, growing up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.320
there wasn't a lot of money there wasn't really&nbsp;
any money you know i couldn't, i never was able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.080
to sort of go shopping buy clothes stuff like that&nbsp;
it was always hand-me-downs this kind of thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.080
and like if if i had money to buy food it would&nbsp;
have to be like whatever was cheap it's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.680
70p scotch egg from tesco's or like you know&nbsp;
halal fried chicken Â£1.99 this kind of thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.200
um so obviously for me growing up i never really&nbsp;
got into the habit of spending money because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.120
there was never no money to spend really but as&nbsp;
you know i was very committed to making money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:21.920
i always wanted to make a lot of money um and&nbsp;
then when i got my job in the city as a trader um

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.240
actually the amount of money people 
was making&nbsp;was a lot more than i thought

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.520
was a lot of money like the amount of&nbsp;
money which was a lot of money to them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.240
was a lot more than what i&nbsp;
had imagined basically and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.600
i realised 2 things like quite early in my&nbsp;career 
which was -  1. these guys are making a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.400
of money like really a lot of money and 2. most&nbsp;
of these guys have got no idea what they're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480
so like, i remember one guy like when&nbsp;
early in my career there was a guy trading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.680
on my desk and he like rocked up at like 10am&nbsp;
we were supposed to start at 7am and the boss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.840
asked him why why are you getting in this late&nbsp;
and he said last night was um Russian new year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.880
he said he'd been out partying all night&nbsp;and
this guy didn't know what he was doing but i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360
realised that there was a lot of guys didn't know&nbsp;
what they were doing and they're making a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.560
money and that made me realise if i really get my&nbsp;
head down i can figure out what's happening here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.120
you know like i've spoken in my other videos about&nbsp;
how the predictions are wrong every single year so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.760
i realised look these guys don't know what they're&nbsp;
doing, they're still making a lot of money if i can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.760
figure out what's really happening here i can make&nbsp;
in a few years enough money to retire basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.320
and like i got my head down and just&nbsp;
devoted myself to like i want to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.520
what's happening in the economy? how to
be the best trader that there is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.280
and i was just obsessed with that, that's all&nbsp;
i thought about, that's all i did every day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.800
and um i was so obsessed with becoming the &nbsp;
best trader that i didn't really have time to think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.640
about what to do with this money and like i sort&nbsp;
of put my head down for like two, three years and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.040
by the time i looked up i was the top trader in&nbsp;
the bank and i'd made millions of pounds basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.040
and then it was just there and then suddenly like&nbsp;
i didn't even really, i came from being very poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.040
and not ever spending money and then by the&nbsp;
time i made money by the time i'd stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.360
working out how to make money, i was already 
really&nbsp;rich basically, rich enough to retire so

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.880
but as i've spoken about in some of my other 
videos i made&nbsp;the money by betting that the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.600
global economy was&nbsp;going to be terrible forever 
so it was like a mad&nbsp;situation i was in right where

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.000
i'd made all this&nbsp;money &amp; i never even started 
spending money&nbsp;so i'm still living like an ordinary

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.320
person in terms of spending &amp; yet suddenly i've
made millions of pounds by betting the world was&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.960
gonna be terrible forever you know what i mean &nbsp;
so then it was like by then it was enough money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.680
to retire you know i mean and then i was sort of&nbsp;
thinking well if you've got enough money to retire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.960
and you know that terrible things are going to&nbsp;
happen probably you need to retire and try and do&nbsp;

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.480
something at least say something you know even&nbsp;
if it's not going to work you have a responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.400
don't you, to try and say something so then&nbsp;like
i quit the job right and um i quit the job&nbsp;before 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.280
i'd ever really started spending money but&nbsp;then 
when i quit the job then i didn't have no&nbsp;income 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.560
you know what i mean so then suddenly&nbsp;
it was a weird situation where i had a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
of money in the bank but i'd gone back into a&nbsp;
situation where like month to month i wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.480
having any money coming in, so it's kind of a&nbsp;
weird situation and um even though i knew that i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.360
had made a lot of money it was um it's this&nbsp;
weird sort of insecure feeling when there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.880
nothing coming in like that was like, you know&nbsp;
what it was like when i was a kid and then um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.760
i just um i just thought i'd go back&nbsp;
to like how life always was not like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.400
don't get me wrong right i'm not eating scotch&nbsp;
eggs from tesco anymore, well i do sometimes&nbsp;

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.720
but um you know i like to travel and you know&nbsp;
sometimes i go to restaurants and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.360
you know i eat when i need to eat, like i used&nbsp;
to skip meals now i don't have to do that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.480
for me like i suppose i became so interested in&nbsp;
economics and the economy that like that is what i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.640
put my energy into you know what i mean and&nbsp;
also i know what it's like to not have money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.720
it's it's [ __ ] to not have&nbsp;
money it's difficult and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.200
for me the most important thing about having&nbsp;
money is i don't need to worry about paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.880
a mortgage i don't need to worry about paying&nbsp;
the bills i don't need to worry about my kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.640
being poor like i was poor you know i mean for
me that's that's what i really want like i don't&nbsp;really 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.040
need a gold chain and you know what i mean 
pair of balenciaga's like for me i was never really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.000
interested in that, don't get me wrong like if&nbsp;you 
work your whole life to buy like a dream car then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.400
go and buy it but for me it was never really about&nbsp;
that i just wanted to be a damn good trader and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.760
and i was &amp; also to just not have those 
worries&nbsp;that my parents had &amp; that i had

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.120
when i was a kid, so for me like that money&nbsp;
i can use it to bet on the markets i can use it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.120
to exercise my skill which is understanding&nbsp;
the economy and being a good trader but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.200
the most important thing about it is it means&nbsp;
that i have the freedom to do this as my job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.240
you know i don't get paid to do this, i do this&nbsp;
because i think it's important that people know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.840
that the only way to make things better is to&nbsp;
deal with this problem of wealth inequality so

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.080
so yeah if people want to know why um i don't drive&nbsp;
a lamborghini in my videos it's um it's because um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.880
nobody's paying me to make them&nbsp;
and um i don't need the lamborghini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.920
for me look i'm just a regular guy i'm here for&nbsp;
the economics that's um yeah that's it you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.840
maybe if i start getting 100 million&nbsp;
views things will change but um we'll see

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.080
but poorer families will be forced&nbsp;to lose 
almost all their assets&nbsp;including their home  

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.160
we have a tax system which is&nbsp;very 
efficient at taxing ordinary working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.840
but very inefficient at taxing the super rich
