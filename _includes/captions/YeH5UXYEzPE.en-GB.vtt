00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.040
Today

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.640
we are going to ask

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.640
the question is the UK government bankrupt?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.880
Okay.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.960
So we are doing an emergency shoot today

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.240
on Friday the 10th of January

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.720
because I wanted to cover

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.680
this developing situation,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.720
which could end up being really significant.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.040
I don't think it's being covered very well on the news

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.120
and I wanted to make sure you understood

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.440
what's happening.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.720
So this story is mainly about the interest rate

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.200
that the government has to pay when it borrows money.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.680
And that interest rate

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.600
has been gradually increasing over the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.800
course of the last year.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.720
That interest rate has been gradually increasing

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.120
for the last sort of three, four months.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.520
And it's increased really aggressively

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680
in the last few weeks.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.640
The interest rate that the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.400
government has to pay at the moment, right now

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.720
is about 4.83%.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.560
And that is raising questions

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.440
about basically whether the UK government

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.760
is financially sustainable, essentially.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.640
And it's very realistically possible

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.400
that these sudden increases in UK

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.000
government borrowing rates

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
will force the UK government

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.600
into basically making emergency cuts in its spending.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000
Which you probably could describe

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.880
as a return to austerity.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.120
But I think the most important thing

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.520
is, first of all, we explain really clearly

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.960
what is happening here

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.920
and why is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.720
that an interest rate of just under

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.040
5% is so dangerous for the UK.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.360
So if you look historically and I've got a graph here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.400
and I think we'll pop them up,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.480
If you look at historical

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.280
interest rates that the UK government paid,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.240
on its borrowings,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.280
the current rate,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.880
which is just under 5%, was super,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.200
super normal in the 2000’s before the financial crisis.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.240
And if you go back to the 90s,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.800
they used to pay significantly higher rates or 6%,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.480
7% back in the 80s, even higher rates than that.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280
So why is it that now

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.720
that the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.880
rate is just under 5%,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.200
people are really worried

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.880
about the UK financial situation?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.120
In order to explain that,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120
we need to talk about why it is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.720
that governments are able to borrow every year.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.600
So governments do this really interesting thing

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.760
where pretty much every year

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.040
they spend more than they tax,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.400
which means they borrow money every year.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.720
And yet the amount of debt that they have

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.240
as a proportion of GDP,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.640
as a proportion of the size of the total economy

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.840
often doesn't go up.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.240
So how do governments do this kind of magic trick

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.000
where they borrow money every year,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880
and yet their debt doesn't go up?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.480
Okay, so the key thing that you want

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.920
to understand about debt

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.040
is that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.880
what matters for government

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.280
financial sustainability

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.920
is not so much the size of the debt itself.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.880
It's the size of the debt

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.480
compared to the overall size of the economy, which

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.320
we usually call GDP.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.160
So.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.440
The government borrows more money

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.240
every year, which causes debt to go up.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.600
And the reason they get away with this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.240
is because GDP is also constantly increasing.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.920
Now why is GDP increasing.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
So GDP growth can be broken down into two things.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.000
The first one is the thing

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.320
that you often hear about in the news,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.760
which is economic growth.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.960
So you know,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.320
the UK economy at the moment is growing

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.000
about 1% a year.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.600
But one other reason

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.880
that governments get away borrowing more every year

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.000
is inflation.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.800
Now,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.840
what you need to understand about inflation is,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.080
inflation doesn't affect the size of your debt.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.760
So if you borrow money from the bank,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.800
you borrow, say, £1,000.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.480
You have to pay back £1,000 plus 5% interest.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.360
That's £1,050..

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.880
That is £1,050. No matter what inflation is.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.320
So if inflation is really, really high, say 20%,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.440
you're only paying 5% interest.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.800
But the price of everything else is going up.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.840
The people's wages are going up.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.240
The goods and services are going up.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.680
Food, energy is going up.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.960
So inflation also causes

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.480
GDP to rise.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.000
One way to think about this is that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.920
inflation is the devaluation of money.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.640
If you want to think about that, you can get the,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.000
you can watch the devaluation of money

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.160
video on our channel.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520
But inflation causes

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.080
GDP to rise and it doesn't cause debt to rise.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.520
So basically

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.120
GDP has this double boost,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.080
double boost, one from economic growth

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.040
and one from inflation.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.640
And that means that debt can afford to rise

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.520
without debt over GDP from increasing.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.320
The problem we have with debt

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.520
is that we have to pay interest.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.440
So essentially there's three forces here.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.280
Interest.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.840
Pushes your debt up.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.400
And inflation

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.000
and growth.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.520
Push your GDP up.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.240
So really what matters is comparing these three things.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.320
Okay. So what's inflation.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.680
So inflation was very high the last few years.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.800
But at the moment

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.240
inflation is down back to around target.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.880
It's currently around 3%.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.000
But the Bank of England targets inflation at 2%, 2.5%.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.800
Well its target is actually 2%.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.760
But if you look historically

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.280
it does tend to be a bit higher than that over time.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.480
If we assume that the Bank of England

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.280
slightly misses its target

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.320
and long term inflation is 2.5%,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.480
that helps us because it’s going to keep GDP rising.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.880
Growth at the moment, and

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.800
this is the big problem in the UK, is only 1%.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.760
Add these two things together

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.960
3.5%.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.120
Excuse my terrible handwriting.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.600
What's debt interest now?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.280
Debt interest is changing literally

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.560
while I make the video.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.600
Debt interest

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.120
at the moment is 4.86%.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.680
This is your big problem.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.960
4.96% is

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.000
significantly more than 3.5%,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.560
which means

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.400
unless the government

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240
does something managed to increase growth,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.000
the debt is going to grow faster than GDP over time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.880
And debt as a proportion of GDP is going to grow.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.400
The only way for them to prevent

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.160
that from happening is either to increase inflation,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.880
to increase economic growth,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.200
get the interest rate down,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.760
or it has to run a budget surplus,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.320
which basically means taxing from you

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.280
more than it gives to you in spending.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.920
in a sense, this makes it clear why

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.360
the financial situation

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.760
after, for example,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.360
2008, when government debt increased significantly,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.320
was less worrying

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.960
than, from the perspective of, say,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.440
the UK than it is now.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.360
And that is because after 2008,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.760
we had this very, very long

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.760
period of basically zero interest rates,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.680
which meant that the government could borrow,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.680
at sort of 2%, even 1% at times.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.320
And since inflation is around 2%,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.960
if you can borrow at 1%,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.400
that debt is just going to stay quite stable.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.560
It's going to go up by 1% every year

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.880
and down by 2% every year.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.480
And effectively,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.920
the government basically pays no interest at all.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.640
But as these interest rates push up

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.280
more and more and more and more and more.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.080
It creates this potential

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.400
for a negative kind of debt spiral dynamic.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.040
And I've been watching these interest rates

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.280
because a normal rate of sort

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.120
of inflation plus growth is something like

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.640
3.5%, maybe 4%.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.160
As it starts to rise above 4%,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
it gets more and more worrying

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.400
Okay.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.680
So that's your explanation

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.680
of how to understand

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.000
basically whether the government interest rate

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.200
is a problem or not.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.120
You need to understand what is

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.800
GDP growth at the moment it’s around 1%.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.880
Of course, Labour

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.240
would like you to think it's going to go higher

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.720
and maybe it will.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.400
Inflation is probably around 2%, 2.5%.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.920
So as long as interest rates

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.440
are pushing above four and a half, the higher

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.520
they get, the more difficult it will be.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.960
And if the government doesn't want debt

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.240
to increase over time,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.440
it has no choice basically,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.080
but to start taxing more than it spends.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.520
Basically extracting that money from ordinary people.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.480
So this has become

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.280
a big

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.680
talking point in financial markets

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.520
in the last few days.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.680
The first thing I will say is

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.520
people are obviously going to compare this

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.320
to the Liz Truss situation.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.520
That is pretty unfair.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.640
I think the Liz Truss situation was really chaotic,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.520
and it was

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.320
basically brought upon itself by some wild decisions

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.560
by Liz Truss and her government.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.920
What has happened here is

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.680
the UK was already in a difficult situation

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.760
because the debt was increased

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.040
so significantly during Covid,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.320
and they sort of tried to toe this middle ground of,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.040
we're not going to tax the rich more,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.520
we're going to borrow, we're going to be sensible.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.480
Whenever your plan is based on borrowing,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.360
there's always the risk that interest rates will go up.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.680
In the last few months, interest rates have increased

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.280
all around the world,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.800
and the government has been kind of using

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.240
that to defend itself.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.520
They're saying this is not a UK government mistake.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.280
This is moves in global interest rates.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.680
It's caused by,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.280
people are a bit worried about what Donald Trump

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.240
might do when it comes in.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.440
That is all true.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.440
But the fact of the matter is.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.880
With interest rates where they are at the moment,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.560
it is very possible

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.600
the government can't afford to fund itself long term.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.400
And that is why a move in global interest rates

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.360
that have pushed

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.560
everybody's borrowing rates up

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.160
has hit specifically the UK.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.640
And we can explain that,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.200
why it's the UK specifically,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.320
largely by showing you a list.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.800
And I'll bring this list up

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.560
of what different countries in the world pay to borrow.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.640
So you can see here

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.440
comparing the UK to European countries,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.520
the UK pays about 4.83%.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.960
The highest rate paid by any other large

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.120
European country is Italy, which is 3.74%,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.480
which is a fall more than 1% below.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.480
Now remember, growth

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.160
plus inflation is probably going to be about 3.5%, 4%.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.160
So Italy at 3.74%,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.440
that growth is not going to grow over...

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.840
that debt is not going to grow over time

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.400
as a percentage of the economy.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.320
Whereas that UK number 4.83%,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.760
potentially will grow as a percentage of the economy.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.440
Okay, so the UK situation is particularly bad.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.880
Interest rates go pushed up across the world.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.120
Traders start to look at that UK

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.760
number 4.93% and question

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.760
whether the UK financial situation is sustainable.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.600
That caused on, well,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.680
yesterday morning, Thursday morning,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.600
a bit of a panic in markets. The bonds started sell.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.680
The interest rates started to rise quickly.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.560
What does that mean for you.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.040
What does that mean for the government?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.280
The government cannot allow a panic

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.920
to occur in these bond markets because

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.080
if that rate starts to rise, really quickly,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.680
if it rises to 5.1%, 5.2%, 5.3%,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.840
every little bit that goes up

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.800
makes it more questionable

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800
whether the government can afford to fund itself.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.800
And as it becomes more and more questionable

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.800
whether the government can fund itself,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.120
the borrowers want higher and higher rates

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.320
because they're worried that the government

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.440
won’t be able to pay it back.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.600
And that creates a real risk for a negative spiral.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.200
You know, we all saw what happened to Liz Truss.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.320
The government's made a big deal out of Liz Truss.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.400
The government absolutely need to prevent this.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.800
So what can the government do?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.640
What will the government do?

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.200
Financial markets will basically demand,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.080
that the government

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.960
reduce their deficit.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.000
You can reduce your deficit in two ways.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.440
You can either increase taxes or you can cut spending.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.960
If the government is forced to do something

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.360
very quickly,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.600
it's very unlikely

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.000
that they have done the preparation

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.640
for a wide variety of tax rises.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.080
They will probably be forced to cut spending.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.520
That would be so devastating

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.600
politically for an already unpopular government.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.920
Who made a lot out of Liz Truss's failings

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.720
that they will probably do anything to avoid it.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.040
And what they will do

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.920
and what they have been doing over

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.160
the last couple of days

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.800
is basically really aggressively

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.080
trying to wink at the financial markets and say,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.960
we're going to do the cuts, but

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.640
wait till March.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640
And the reason they want to do that

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.800
is because when March is

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.200
when the next sort of fiscal statement is

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.560
they want it to look orderly.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.400
They want to say, listen, in the last few months,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.000
interest rates have risen.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.480
We're responding and we're cutting.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.600
They don't want to seem like it's

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.280
a kind of a second Liz Truss moment.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.400
Now this plays into something

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.360
which Labour made a lot

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.960
about in their election campaign,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.560
which is Labour's fiscal rules.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.760
There's a few fiscal rules,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.680
but the one that is most relevant here

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.520
is that Labour have promised to stabilise this thing,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.000
which we have been speaking about in this whole video.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.600
They want to stabilise debt

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.400
as a proportion of GDP,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.640
as a proportion of the overall economy.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.800
As we discussed before, debt rises with interest.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.280
So as the interest rate goes up,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.080
unless you can get GDP growth out of somewhere,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.040
the only way to stop the debt from rising

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.840
as a percentage of your GDP is to have inflation

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.960
or basically to cut your deficit,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.000
to start taxing more, to reduce your spending.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.200
So the government,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.680
if they want to follow their own fiscal rules,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.000
they basically cannot help

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.520
but be driven by financial markets.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.080
If something happens like has happened

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.560
in this last couple of weeks,

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.840
and interest rates rise significantly

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.640
because the government has set this fiscal rule,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.000
the government basically has to do cuts.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.520
And unless financial markets turn around quickly,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.960
it's going up, going up as I speak,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.880
unless financial markets turn around quickly.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.080
Really, there's only

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.520
two possible things that can happen,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.880
which is the government manages

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.800
to convince markets to wait till March,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.360
does its cuts in March.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.880
Or if things get really bad

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.880
in the next couple of weeks,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.360
the government might even be forced

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.360
to do some kind of emergency statement

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.200
where they, where they announce cuts.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.680
Basically.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.320
Either way,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.520
the financial markets are going to enforce austerity

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.760
again on you by your government Okay.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.280
Now I'm covering this now as it moves.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.560
And I don't want to like,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.480
panic people.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.120
This could go one of two ways, right?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.240
Either the market calms down in the next few weeks.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.920
The government is able to wait till March,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.800
or it keeps going,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.640
and the government is forced to

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.640
do cuts more imminently.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.960
Either way, this means austerity.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.840
If this goes the most serious way

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.800
and I don't think this is probable,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.480
but it's definitely possible.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.160
If it calls Starmer and Reeves out

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.760
to make an emergency statement of cuts,

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.720
given how little political capital they have.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.840
It could potentially

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.800
end the Starmer, Reeves government.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.840
I don't think they would replace them immediately.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.200
But

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.520
it could leave them in a sort of Theresa

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.440
May situation where they're left on as a dead duck,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.640
where it would look really bad.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.680
It will look really, really bad

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.880
if they were forced to suddenly backtrack

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.440
in a similar way to Liz Truss did.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.960
And to be fair,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.360
I think they would be unlucky if that happened,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.720
because what they have done...

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.360
and I think this brings me to my next point,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.000
which I wanted to make,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.680
which is a lot of people in the media

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.760
will say

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.800
that this is because

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.400
especially if it gets more serious,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.640
they will say that this is because of the budget.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.600
The budget back last year.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.240
And I think that would be

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.960
a pretty bad representation of what's really happening.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.320
The budget was pretty f***ing mild in my opinion.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.000
It was a pretty milk toast budget.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.400
They slightly... they did slightly increased borrowing.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.800
They slightly increased taxes,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.240
they slightly increased spending.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.760
But it was a very moderate budget.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.360
And I don't think we should be surprised by that

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.600
because Starmer and Reeves are kind of defined

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.880
in a sense, by their economic sensibleness

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.200
and their economic moderation.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.560
I think the problem that you have,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.440
is that

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.080
the financial situation was pretty terrible coming in.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.960
And, when I say this, you know,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.360
I think I'm

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.200
sort of going to go down

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.280
the classic Labour line of, oh,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.960
this is the Tories, blame the Tories, but

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.760
I'm not going to do that.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.400
Really, what is happening now

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.400
is in a sense, the inevitable consequence is not of

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.560
the budget last year, but of the

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.600
really terrible economic mismanagement of Covid.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.480
Now, if you go back, I mention it a lot...

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.480
look at the opening, the first video

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.680
we ever shot on this channel.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.160
I spoke a lot about the massive accumulation of cash

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.920
by the rich and how that would cause

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.000
an inflation crisis and cost of living crisis

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.800
and an inequality crisis.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.320
But one other thing that I mentioned there

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.600
was that

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.560
this money that went to the rich

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.480
came from the government,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.240
and it would cause

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.520
and did cause a massive, massive increase

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.400
in government debt and a massive decrease in

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.640
basically government financial sustainability.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.120
And at the time, it wasn't easy to know

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.040
whether that would lead to austerity or not.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.960
And the reason for that is basically

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.400
because of the things

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.440
that we've discussed in this video.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.640
After 2008,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.960
we entered a period of extremely low interest rates,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.080
which meant that the government could,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.000
if it wanted, have continued to borrow and continue

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.320
to spend without really damaging

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.640
financial sustainability,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.120
because when interest rates are very, very low,

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.200
they’re lower than inflation your government debt

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.640
simply cannot spiral out of control.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.320
There was always the risk

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.840
when you massively increased your government debt

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.320
of coming into the kind of situation we are in now.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.240
If interest rates ever go up,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.440
then basically

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.560
your government becomes a slave to financial markets

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.920
and the financial markets can force you to cut.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.320
The financial markets can force you

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.840
to reverse your policy.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.960
That's what they did to Liz Truss.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.640
That's what they did to Greece back in the 2010s.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.080
This is an inevitable part

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.720
of allowing your financial situation to deteriorate.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.560
And if you ask me, the real mistakes were made here

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:03.280
in 2020, 2021, 2022, when we knew

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.040
the government was going

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.000
to give an enormous amount of money out,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.960
and we had a period of two years of lockdown

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.640
when we could have said, okay, who's

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.960
gonna end up with that money?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.680
How are we going to get the money back?

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.640
How can we deal with our taxation policy?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.120
How can we restore the government financial position?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.920
And basically we didn't do it.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.640
And I want to add to that, you know,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.160
I'm not saying furlough shouldn't have happened.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.320
I'm not saying the government didn't

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.640
need to spend an enormous amount of money.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.840
That money was used to

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.200
give people the money they

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.320
need to pay their rent, to buy their food

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.000
when they weren't able to work.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.040
We had three years to discuss the questions of

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.680
where's the money gone? Where's the money ended up?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.120
How is it going to affect distribution?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.680
Can we get the money back?

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.840
And really what you see here

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.160
is the result of a long period of phenomenal naivety

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.720
regarding the importance of resources.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.600
Resources and distribution.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.280
What you saw

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.640
during Covid

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.560
was the government

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.960
giving an enormous amount of money away.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.640
That money went to the rich.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.480
The rich can use that money

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.760
to buy the resources from the middle class, to buy

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.080
resources ordinary people need.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.200
You've lost your resources.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.920
I've said this before

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.120
and I'm going to say this again and again.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.080
If you give all your resources away,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.640
you are left with two choices.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.240
Try and get your resources back,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.840
which in this case means

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.080
finding ways to tax

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.160
the super rich who've got that money now,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.840
or accept poverty.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.520
And I think what we're seeing now is increasingly

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.200
this attempt at a third way,

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.480
which the current Labour government are trying

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.960
is not going to work.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.080
It's not going to work.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.720
It's possible that we get lucky.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.920
Interest rates start to fall over the next

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.600
few weeks, months.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.760
Now, inflation will fall over the next six months.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.160
Bank of England base rates will very likely fall.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.000
This situation could improve.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.800
It's very, very difficult.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.360
It's very, very, very difficult

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.760
to borrow your way out of a hole.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.720
One thing I want to say is,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.880
I know there'll be a lot of people here

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.480
that will say, listen,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.240
we shouldn't let financial markets dominate our

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.120
government policy.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.360
We shouldn't let financial markets

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.920
dominate our fiscal policy.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.160
You know, I agree with that.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.320
If you don't want financial markets

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.280
to dominate your governmental policy.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.080
You cannot give all your resources to the rich

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.280
and have your financial plan be borrow them back.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.840
This is what happens.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.400
If you give all your resources away

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.720
and your plan is to borrow them back,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.760
then you will be at the mercy

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.560
of the interest rates of the lenders,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.960
the interest rates of the traders,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.440
the interest rates of the rich.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.600
The only way to defend your resources

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.560
once you've given them away

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.240
is to work on your taxation policy.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.040
And we should be in a situation

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.920
now where we don't need to borrow from the rich

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.600
because we are able to tax

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.200
on the super rich

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.360
and use that to get our resources back

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.800
and use those resources

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.960
to provide the goods and services that you need.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.080
But we're trying to toe this middle path of borrowing,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.480
give all our resources away, try and borrow them back.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.280
This is the risk that you take.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.160
The last thing I want to say is,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.840
I know that this crisis

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.680
looks quite UK specific at the moment.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.160
There are a lot of countries

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.960
that are not further down the line on this.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.920
The situation in the US is slightly better

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.040
because they have higher growth.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.600
The situation in Australia is slightly better

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.080
because they have higher growth.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.080
The situation in European countries is slightly better

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.840
because the interest rates are lower.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.960
If interest rates keep going,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.680
your country could be next.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.480
You need to protect your resources.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.640
The resources have been given to the rich.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.040
If you don't fix your taxation policy,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.960
you will have no choice but to slowly

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.440
shut down

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.280
your welfare states

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.080
and your countries

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.280
will look like impoverished countries,

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.800
like India, like South Africa, like Brazil.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.840
Go to those countries. See how ordinary people live.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.200
That can come here, that can come to your country,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.000
that can come to my country.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.280
I don't want to panic you.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.600
This might resolve itself. This could get worse.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.520
Living standards will keep deteriorating

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.120
unless we get our resources back.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.600
That means taxing, not just borrowing.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.680
Thanks for your help. Good luck.
