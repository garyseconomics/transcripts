00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.820
I'm Gary Stevenson welcome back to Gary's&nbsp;
Economics today we're going to talk about Politics

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.240
okay so there have been three big developments&nbsp;
recently in politics that you need to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
when we look at each of them initially they&nbsp;
they might look like things that are worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.400
celebrating but they're all going to present&nbsp;
problems you need to know what they mean for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.760
you so that you can react to it so the three&nbsp;
things are number one the government has rode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.220
back on basically all of the disaster budget&nbsp;
from a few weeks ago number two it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.140
very possible that Liz Truss will leave as prime&nbsp;
minister and conservative party leader very soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.900
and number three it's become very likely&nbsp;
that labour will win the next election&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.100
we're going to talk about all three of those&nbsp;
things one at a time so we're going to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.860
with the first thing which is the reverse of the&nbsp;
budget so you probably know there was a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.360
budget a few weeks ago where the conservative&nbsp;
Government tried to slash taxes massively for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.200
richest there's a video on the channel which you&nbsp;
can go watch if you haven't seen about that budget&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.720
um they've reversed nearly everything there so&nbsp;
people who watch the channel will know I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
massively against that budget so it's easy to&nbsp;
think they've reversed the budget that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.260
to be fantastic until you see what it looks&nbsp;
like they're going to replace the budget with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.300
so it looks like they've moved basically&nbsp;
to a new version of austerity which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.780
cutting budgets for public services education&nbsp;
Healthcare local Services police now these are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.080
things which I've already had their budgets cut&nbsp;
massively in the austerity government from 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.660
so if we cut these things again we're basically&nbsp;
looking at a situation where there's pretty much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.300
nothing left to cut you are cutting into the bone&nbsp;
here so if we move into an austerity situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.300
you're talking about basically dismantling the&nbsp;
basic services that allow this country to function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.580
dismantling the police dismantling the schools&nbsp;
dismantling the NHS totally getting rid of local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.540
services this is already at a time when ordinary&nbsp;
families are really struggling um I don't think I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.720
really need to get into the details of what this&nbsp;
will mean for ordinary families what it will mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.620
for you for your community for your family if this&nbsp;
happens it will have a devastating impact not only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.540
that but it will mean more job cuts for people who&nbsp;
work in public services that will mean more people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.220
competing for the existing jobs it will mean wages&nbsp;
will probably fall or struggle to rise definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.260
struggle to rise with inflation so less money in&nbsp;
your pocket less money going around the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.980
um yeah more collapse it's a disaster basically&nbsp;
I want to talk a little bit about why that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.320
happened why we've moved from a situation of let's&nbsp;
cut taxes on rich people to instead let's cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.320
Public Services this has happened because a space&nbsp;
has been opened up in the narrative saying oh it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.500
not possible to cut tax on rich people because the&nbsp;
markets won't accept it which essentially means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.440
we cannot borrow that amount of money and we have&nbsp;
then gone automatically back to the previous sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.080
of narrative framework of well then we have to&nbsp;
have austerity now this is only possible because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.860
the alternative option of instead let's tax&nbsp;
rich and very rich people more has basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.720
been completely removed from the conversation now&nbsp;
people who follow this channel will know that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.460
last three years have seen the biggest and fastest&nbsp;
ever increase in wealth of the rich and the super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.460
rich the average rich person increased To Us by 22&nbsp;
in the first year of covert alone uh the average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.320
billionaire increased the wealth by 620 million in&nbsp;
the first of covid the total amount of government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.840
of money that has gone from the government to&nbsp;
the rich is 600 billion pounds which would be 12&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.380
000 pounds for every adult in the country&nbsp;
so we are in a space here where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.920
government has effectively transferred&nbsp;
an enormous amount of money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.160
if we were to tax that back we could give it to&nbsp;
you we could cut your taxes we could improve a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.440
living stance for ordinary people we wouldn't&nbsp;
have to cut Public Services but unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.140
this is just totally not in the conversation right&nbsp;
now nobody's talking about taxing rich people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.500
if we allow that to be the main frame of&nbsp;
debate then we end up in a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.620
the only alternative is cutting public services so&nbsp;
I think this really emphasizes how important it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.220
that we do not let them ignore this possibility&nbsp;
look at the same time as ordinary families are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.080
literally struggling to eat we have seen the&nbsp;
biggest and fastest ever historic increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.040
millionaire and billionaire wealth we need to&nbsp;
get taxi rich people into the conversation okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.540
so that's number one covered they've rode back&nbsp;
on the budget but they're bringing in well it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.700
quite probably a worse budget for ordinary people&nbsp;
they will be allowed to do that as long as we do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.660
not get tax in the rich back on the conversation&nbsp;
so you need to talk about tax in a rich more you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.840
need to persuade your friends and family that is&nbsp;
important number two is is list trust potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.820
leaving now we're filming this in the beautiful&nbsp;
rain on Thursday morning uh this video will come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.200
out on Sunday morning it's quite possible that&nbsp;
list trust will already be gone by then we totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.960
don't know she might limp on into next year but&nbsp;
it at this point it's almost certain she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.760
not be conservative leader for the next election&nbsp;
um listen I'm not a big fan of this trust I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.060
think anyone would be surprised to hear that I&nbsp;
thought that her Economic Policy was a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.280
thought that her budget was a disaster it would be&nbsp;
tempting to celebrate this trust leaving but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.280
fact is she will be replaced probably by another&nbsp;
austerity prime minister I don't need to tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.780
how bad that is going to be for for you for your&nbsp;
community for this country or for the economy so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.760
we shouldn't be celebrating her leaving because&nbsp;
it's not going to make things better things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.200
going to continue to get worse now the third one&nbsp;
I think is the most interesting one and definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.420
something we need to talk about a lot which is&nbsp;
it is becoming increasingly clear that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.180
very very likely label win the next election&nbsp;
quite possibly even with an outright majority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.400
um betting markets are starting to think this is&nbsp;
60 likely something like this I actually think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.620
it's more likely than that the reason I think&nbsp;
that is because it is becoming inevitable now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.940
living standards and the economy will continue to&nbsp;
collapse seriously over the next couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.000
um in that situation is inevitable that support&nbsp;
for the government will fall and fall and fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.700
and that means that very likely they will win&nbsp;
the next election some people are saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.680
there's a prospect of a labor government very&nbsp;
soon realistically the timing of the election is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.960
almost completely in the power of the conservative&nbsp;
government they know that if they have an election&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.940
shortly they will get smashed most of the MPS&nbsp;
will lose their seats they'll lose their jobs so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.560
it's very likely they will not call a short-term&nbsp;
election and the election will be 2024 maybe even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.840
the very beginning of 2025. so we probably do&nbsp;
have another couple of years of this government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.600
the conservative government um the economy will&nbsp;
almost certainly be disaster throughout that time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.740
but after that we'll probably get a labor&nbsp;
government um now anyone who watches this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.120
will know that I've not been a big supporter&nbsp;
of the current conservative government and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.580
people may have assumed from that that means I'm a&nbsp;
massive supporter of Labor that's not really true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.700
my situation is if you do not do something about&nbsp;
massively rapidly increasing wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.320
you are going to decimate living standards of&nbsp;
ordinary people and Ordinary People are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.200
to lose their wealth they are going to suck the&nbsp;
wealth out of the middle class of this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:33.600
um but it has become increasingly obvious to me in&nbsp;
the last few months that labor is very very likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.380
to come into government before too long so I went&nbsp;
to the labor party conference and I've been I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.220
been getting contacted by some labor MPS and I've&nbsp;
been reaching out to them to try and speak with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.000
labor MPS basically to see is there a possibility&nbsp;
that that they are going to increase tax on very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.940
rich people because I think if we don't do that&nbsp;
it is inevitable that we'll have a disaster um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.860
I have to tell you honestly the sense I'm getting&nbsp;
from the people that I've spoken to is that labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:10.500
are not serious about significantly raising taxes&nbsp;
on rich people you know um I can't mention that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.100
people individually who I've been speaking to but&nbsp;
I spoke to some people recently about the prospect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:23.040
of raising a one percent wealth tax on wealth&nbsp;
assets above 10 million pounds and even that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.280
doesn't look like we're going to get it so you&nbsp;
know you need to think about somebody with worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.760
above 10 million pounds right they make three&nbsp;
four five percent on that every year so all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.060
we're talking about is slowing down by a fraction&nbsp;
the rate at which wealth inequality increases and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.280
labor at the moment does not seem serious about&nbsp;
supporting it so but what does that mean that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.600
means that realistically what is probably going to&nbsp;
happen here is the conservative government limps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.900
on for another couple of years they get replaced&nbsp;
by labor government that labor government doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.340
understand the seriousness of reducing wealth&nbsp;
inequality so they raise taxes on rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:10.200
extremely slightly and all that does is slow down&nbsp;
the rate at which wealth inequality is increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.940
now you probably don't need me to tell you that&nbsp;
in the last few years wealth inequality which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.240
has been increasing for decades now in the last&nbsp;
years it's gone massively accelerated the speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.060
at which World inequality is increasing at this&nbsp;
point if we don't do something very serious to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.200
stop that massive wealth transfer from ordinary&nbsp;
families and from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.740
before long we will totally lose amid the class&nbsp;
and within a generation or two we will become a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.040
very very unequal country if we don't take action&nbsp;
on it that is what's going to happen it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.660
like labor is not going to take Serious enough&nbsp;
action on it what that means is label get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:56.520
power and they will oversee continual worsening&nbsp;
in the economy so under labor they'll probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.240
slightly slow down what I think we honestly&nbsp;
have to say has been a collapse in living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.040
standards they will slow down that collapse&nbsp;
but living standards will continue to fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.400
they will probably stay in government for four&nbsp;
or five years under slowly worsening conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.620
slowly falling living standards understandably&nbsp;
people are going to get pissed off and there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.440
a very real possibility that people are going&nbsp;
to sit there and they're going to say well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.500
the conservatives didn't do nothing for&nbsp;
us labor didn't do nothing for us let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.160
look for something more extreme and&nbsp;
there's a very real possibility that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.780
we move towards some sort of extreme far-right&nbsp;
government that is pushing policies that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.900
maybe more explicitly racist or explicitly&nbsp;
aggressive you know we had a period before where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:46.020
we had an explosion inequality and an economic&nbsp;
crisis and it led to fascism throughout Europe the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.520
Holocaust and the second world war you know this&nbsp;
has happened before and I know that sounds extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.060
but I'm sitting here I'm looking at a country&nbsp;
that's getting increasingly frustrated they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.740
going to vote in a labor government and when&nbsp;
I talk to the labor politicians they do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:08.160
understand at all the seriousness of the problem&nbsp;
here they are going to get in they are not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.660
to deal with wealth inequality wealth inequality&nbsp;
will get worse and the economy will get worse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.580
then really honestly God knows what happens&nbsp;
after that politically um but when I speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:24.420
to them they say to me many of them we would&nbsp;
be happy to support a world tax but we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.440
think it's a vote winner we think it's going to&nbsp;
lose us votes we think people don't support it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.980
to me what that says to me is basically the&nbsp;
importance of what we are trying to do here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.180
if we don't deal with wealth inequality the&nbsp;
rich will get massively richer ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.920
will lose their homes they'll go further into&nbsp;
their government services will be ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.360
decimated the country will become phenomenally&nbsp;
unequal and living standards will collapse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.840
um and unless you watching this are very rich&nbsp;
that's you your kids your grandkids your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.320
your communities living standards collapsing okay&nbsp;
you need to support High attacks on the richest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.880
and you need to convince your friends and you need&nbsp;
to convince your family and you need to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.540
your community and you know over the next few&nbsp;
weeks and months we're going to do a series of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.820
videos explaining why it's important and hopefully&nbsp;
you can use that to understand it and to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.340
the people around you but until enough Ordinary&nbsp;
People support it I can't turn around to labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:29.340
and make them do it So the plan here is that we&nbsp;
need to build a massive community of people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:35.700
understand the importance of wealth inequality&nbsp;
demand it from their political parties and spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.080
that message around because if enough people are&nbsp;
turning around to the labor party saying listen we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.520
are only going to vote for you if you do something&nbsp;
about wealth inequality then I could turn around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.480
to them and say you have to do it and they&nbsp;
can't turn to me and say well it's a vote loser&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:55.860
so um listen there's an opportunity here but at&nbsp;
the moment we're not making it at the moment labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.400
are going to come in and they're not going to fix&nbsp;
the problem and things are going to get worse we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.460
can make things better if enough people understand&nbsp;
that the only way to improve living conditions for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.420
ordinary families and ordinary people in this&nbsp;
country is to deal with wealth inequality so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.160
you need to understand that you know go and watch&nbsp;
what is wealth go watch the first video on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.860

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.600

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.280

if you get a bit more money and&nbsp;
the rich get a lot more money you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.620
will become poorer and you need to&nbsp;
have a policy which actively focuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

on reducing energy consumption of the&nbsp;
rich and support support it's not there
