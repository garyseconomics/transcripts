00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.520
Today

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.320
we are finally going to explain

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.160
how we can stop the economy from collapsing.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.520
Okay, so in the last couple of months,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.120
I've been on tour.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280
I've been up and down the country a couple of times,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.880
we've had a massive press campaign,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.840
so I've been all over the TV, radio, the internet,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.720
basically explaining that the economy is collapsing,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.240
that it will continue to collapse,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.560
and that ordinary families

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.840
will be driven into poverty,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720
that our kids and our grandkids

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.400
won't be able to afford homes and financial security.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.320
And,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.600
we've been getting a lot of press,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.480
and that has obviously been

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880
basically worrying a lot of people,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.000
people should be worried because this is happening.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.760
And people are asking me, okay, Gary, what can we do?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.680
How can we stop that?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.440
And, I’ve

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320
spent quite a lot of time explaining the problem,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680
but perhaps not so much explaining

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.800
what we can do to stop the problem.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.480
So today, what I'm going to try my best to do

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.080
is explain

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.840
really clearly, as much as possible

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.920
from the ground up,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.200
how I think we can stop

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.280
this economic collapse from happening.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.560
All right.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.480
So the very first thing we need to do

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.800
is just recap very quickly what the economic problem

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.920
actually is in its most basic terms.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600
And I'm going to try to explain that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840
in a simple diagram, which I'm going to draw here.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.760
Okay. So we've got these four groups in society.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.600
We've got the working class,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.120
we've got the middle class,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.000
you've got the government and we've got the rich.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
Now for most of history and in most of the world today,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.600
pretty much all of the wealth in society,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.720
the land, the property, the natural resources,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.160
the businesses are owned by the rich.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.440
But for a period of time after the Second World War,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.280
we had a situation where basically all of these groups

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.840
held a decent amount of wealth.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.240
So in my parents generation,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.160
it was normal for even working class families

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.560
to have a pension

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.400
and own their own property, for example.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.120
So we had a period where all of these groups

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.640
had a decent amount of wealth,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.960
but the rich had more,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.160
and especially after their taxes were cut in the 80s,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.040
they started to accumulate more and more.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.000
And that meant that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.480
when other groups in society

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.600
wanted to access this wealth, wanted to use this

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.080
wealth, wanted to use

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.280
housing, property, natural resources,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.800
buildings, they had to pay

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.680
rents, profits, dividends to the rich,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.320
and wealth started to flow

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000
away from these other groups and towards the rich.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.120
And these flows

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.880
really started to increase,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.080
especially during the 2008 crisis

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.400
and during the Covid crisis.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.760
And it led to a situation where really

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.960
there was very large scale transfer of wealth,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.640
and that is still ongoing.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.400
And the end result

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.080
was that the working class lost pretty much

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.920
all their wealth and got into a bit of debt as well.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.960
The government is now massively in negative wealth,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.640
so they've only got debt.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.800
And the middle class,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.760
they kept some of their wealth, but not so much.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.600
The wealth of the rich

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.680
just got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.120
especially during Covid.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.160
What this meant was

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.880
because these groups of society,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.920
who traditionally are the big spenders

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.360
in terms of proportion of their wealth,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.280
were losing their wealth.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.880
Spending fell, wages fell

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.440
and because these guys have much more wealth now

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.200
and these guys have less

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.400
these transfer payments

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.320
which you have to make to

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.720
use wealth, access resources, went up

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.080
because you've got less resources now they've got more.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.920
So you need to pay to use

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.080
a greater amount of resources.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.680
So these flows increased.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.960
And now we're in a situation

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.160
where basically these groups are basically wiped out.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280
The working class has basically nothing left.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.120
These guys already live

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120
in increasingly desperate poverty.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.280
The government is, like, totally bankrupted,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.640
they're out.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.440
And the middle class has just this little bit left,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.440
which they're hanging on to,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440
but it's gradually being sucked out.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.600
And, before long, they will be gone too.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
And then you end up in this situation

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.160
where basically the rich own everything.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.560
You have no middle class, nobody else owns anything.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.760
And an economy like that looks like,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.920
looks like Nigeria, looks like India, looks like Brazil.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.880
And basically you have very broad poverty.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880
If you want to fix this,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.320
you need to get wealth flowing back

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.920
in the other direction.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.120
And, there are different ways to do this.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.320
In theory, you can do it without taxes.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.440
And if you are interested in non-tax solutions

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.760
for getting ordinary families their wealth back,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.040
we have a video

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.520
called The Wealth Time Limit, which I did years ago.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.640
But realistically,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.800
I think you're only realistic hope

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.320
of getting the wealth back in the working class,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.880
back in the middle class, getting wealth

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.600
to flow away

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.160
from the rich is, to quote the Dutch historian

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.680
Bregman, “Taxes, taxes,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.600
taxes”.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.320
I do really think this is the only way.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.480
I know it's difficult because the rich will oppose it,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.000
but I think

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.160
unless we can get much higher

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.440
levels of tax on the rich,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.440
I don't think there is any way we can get

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.880
that wealth back to working

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.440
class and middle class families.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.360
So if we're talking about tax,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.800
I always think

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720
when we are discussing the question of

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.880
how can we tax the rich more,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.200
tax working families less,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.240
get wealth flowing back to working class families.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240
I always think it's really,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.240
really helpful to break that question of tax down

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.840
into two completely separate questions.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.280
Question one,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.280
what specific changes do we want in the tax system?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.480
And question two,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.160
how do we make

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.000
those changes happen.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200
And the reason why

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.400
I think it's really important to separate them

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.360
is because these are really

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.080
just two completely separate questions.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.760
This number one is a question of...

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.600
really it's a technical question.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.000
It's a kind of a, it's a tax

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.880
advisers, it's a tax planners question. It's...

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.400
it's a technical economics question.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.680
And number two is a question of, of power.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.560
It's a question of how do we force these things.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.440
And the reason why

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.440
I think it's really, really important to separate them

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.840
is because we tend to focus very,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.520
very much on this - question one.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.480
Especially when we are talking to

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
people like me who are economists.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.760
We want to say, okay, well,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.000
what are the changes in the tax system?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.360
What are the change in the tax system?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.240
And I think this is

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.960
perhaps a little bit naive to the fact

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.880
that basically at the moment

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.440
we are losing this debate for question two,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.600
which is at the moment we're not getting any taxes.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.040
at all.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.080
We are increasingly seeing changes in the tax system

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.160
which tax rich people less.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.320
Which tax working people more.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.920
That is true

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.440
even in countries that have

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.640
centre left governments

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.280
who you might think

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.600
would be more supportive of richer...

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.840
of poor people.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.640
It's true here in the UK, we have a Labour government.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.480
It was true under Joe Biden.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.240
We are seeing even under governments

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.640
that are supposed to be left wing,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.800
the inability to raise taxes at all.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.400
So I think

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.240
it's really important to recognise

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.400
that these two things are separate,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.040
because we can often end up in a situation where

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.800
somebody like me is trying to make a very strong case

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.240
for the fact

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.120
that if we don't change the tax system,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.240
we will see basically a collapse of society

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.040
and somebody who

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.720
perhaps is rich or is funded by

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.640
the rich will come in and say, “Aha!

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.880
But what specific changes do you want to make?”

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.320
And they would ask you to sort of sit down

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.640
and carefully plan

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.040
a brand new tax system right there in front of them,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.000
and then they will say, “Oh, well,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.400
this specific problem is wrong

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.760
and this is not going to work.” Listen,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.000
I am not particularly passionate

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.720
about the specific form of tax that we take.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.640
I am aware that it is really,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.320
really important that this is carefully designed

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.600
to hit the richest rather than the middle class.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.080
I'm totally aware of this problem,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.440
and I'm aware that different

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.360
forms of taxes will have different problems.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.160
And I'm aware that we need to be really, really careful

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.720
about how we plan it, how we design it.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.600
But the truth is,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.640
the most important thing is that we get a change

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.320
and there are a number of forms that change can take.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.920
I campaign for wealth taxes.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.800
Some people campaign

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.560
for equalising capital gains with income tax.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.760
Some people talk about closing down the loopholes

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.480
that very rich families use to pay zero taxes.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.960
These are all good plans,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.360
but I don't think we should let the perfect

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.720
be the enemy of the good.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.880
The truth is, we are losing

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.720
this battle for question two.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.480
And if we lose this battle for question two,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.240
then your family will be bankrupted.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.680
So I came into this game, you know, as an economist,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.520
who thought a lot about question one.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.560
And I kind of became a campaigner. A YouTuber.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.520
I literally taught myself how to write a book,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.280
because I could see

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.720
we were going to lose question two.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.920
So I am going to focus

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.920
for the rest of this video on question two.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.360
The only thing I will say about question one is

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.840
I think we need to deal with the fact

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.400
that some people say

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.200
there's no point trying to tax the rich

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.240
because reducing inequality is impossible.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.400
And the answer to that is 100%.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.240
It is possible because we did it in the 20th century.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.120
In the beginning of the 20th century,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.720
inequality in this country,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.520
across Europe, across

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.720
the United States, was extreme high.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.480
And ordinary families like yours

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.200
and mine lived in desperate poverty.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.000
And over the course of the 20th century,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.920
we reduced wealth inequality really significantly.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.080
That got wealth into the hands of ordinary families,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.360
and it led to really significant increases

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.400
in living standards,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.520
which meant that our parents

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.680
and grandparents lived much,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.000
much better lives than people

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.160
in the early 20th century did.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.600
So for now,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.680
we need to focus on getting some form of change,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.680
because if we spend all of our time

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.040
arguing about the specific form of the change,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.000
we wont get anything at all.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.680
There's no point arguing about battle tactics

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.080
until you have an army.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.800
So let's talk about how can we force these politicians

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.920
to give us the things that we need. All right, so. I,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.240
as most of you will know, if you've been watching

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.640
this channel, was an economist,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.280
mathematician and a trader.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.120
I worked as a trader from 2008 to 2014.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.280
I made a lot of money

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.880
by recognising,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.840
basically, exactly the diagram

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.440
I showed you at the beginning of the video,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.520
which was that wealth

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.840
has, was and still is being drained

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.400
out of the middle class, out of the working class,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.040
accumulated by the very rich,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.280
that was going to suck

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.680
spending power out of the economy,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.120
and that was going to impoverish

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.960
most ordinary families.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.640
I bet on that.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.280
And I was very successful

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.000
betting that the economy would collapse.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.440
And I made a lot of money on that.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.200
And I quit trading in 2014.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.040
I was living in Tokyo at the time,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.240
and I came back to London,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.960
basically with this conviction

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.920
that I was right in this relatively

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.640
simple economic understanding that we would see

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.360
continued further and further

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.560
and further worsening of living standards.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.840
And I didn't want that to happen.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.120
I don't want that to happen.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.160
I assume you don't want that to happen

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.960
because it will mean poverty for you and your kids.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.040
And my plan was

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.440
basically, simply to come back to London

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.280
and show people this, this truth.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.040
And I've been spending basically those,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.600
nearly 11 years now since I came back,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.320
trying to figure out

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.760
how can we actually stop this crisis from happening.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.760
And my plan has always been

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.240
really relatively simply,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.440
this crisis will impoverish

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.400
70%, 80%, 90% of the population here in the UK,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.080
in the US,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.040
in Australia, in Europe, wherever you're watching,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.560
and you're seeing that happening,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.960
you are seeing larger and larger

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.920
percentages of the population being impoverished.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.040
And it doesn't make sense

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.320
for the public to accept that.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.120
So all we need to do

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.360
is show them what's happening,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.680
make it clear to them what's happening,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.920
and they will reject it, basically.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.080
But it's been 11 years now

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.120
and we haven't achieved it yet.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.400
So I would like to explain basically how my thinking

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.120
has developed and refined into trying

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.240
to figure out a way that we can really effectively

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.400
stop it.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.440
So when I first came back, the first place I went to

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.120
was I worked for an economics

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.000
think tank in London

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.320
called the New Economics Foundation.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.440
I volunteered there for about six months.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.120
You know, this is a progressive economics 

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.600
think tank in London.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.280
I kind of figured that these would be the guys

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.800
who would help you

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.360
sort of introduce new economics ideas into society.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.680
Their name was literally the New Economics Foundation.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.400
And I volunteered there for six months.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.800
I met a lot of nice people.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.280
Some of them I'm still friends with now.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.920
But I basically became convinced that they

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.120
didn't really have the capacity

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.680
to really push this new idea out.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.560
There was very, very little appetite

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.680
for ideas and inequality.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.720
They needed to get funding

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.000
for all of their individual projects.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.760
And, you know,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.720
they could get a lot of funding

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.840
for global warming stuff

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.800
and kind of identity politics stuff.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.000
But there was basically nobody

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.800
funding wealth inequality stuff.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.960
The space was quite middle class.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.640
So in many cases there weren’t

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.400
people who were not themselves being directly hurt.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.000
I make the point a lot on this channel,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.840
and I think this is important

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.360
to recognise, crises of inequality,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.560
they impoverish 90% of the population,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.320
but they make like 1% or 2% of the population

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.840
absolutely, really bloody rich.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.160
And these guys, they benefit from it.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.640
And there's another sort of 3%,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.680
4% below that that are pretty well protected.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.280
And I sort of found in that think tank space,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.120
a lot of these protected people basically,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.800
and unfortunately whilst

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800
they are in many cases

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800
very well-meaning,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.360
I didn't see any chance of getting

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.560
change essentially from that think tank space.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.320
So I went then to university, I did a two year

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.920
economics master's at Oxford, and,

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.840
you could probably imagine

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.800
if the think tank space was quite

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.400
rich and quite upper middle class, the

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400
Oxford University

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.960
was unbelievably rich and middle class.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.240
And,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.120
you know, good luck to anyone

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.560
who's trying to make change in academia,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.560
and we do need people in those spaces.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.000
I became pretty convinced that

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.280
academia was almost completely

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.320
a dead end at the moment.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.240
I think, you know, we've made videos on this.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.280
I think the situation of university,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.760
especially elite university academic economics, is just

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.520
if the situation wasn't so serious,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.240
it would be quite funny, really.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.760
You've got a lot of very smart kids

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.720
that are locked in

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.640
tiny, windowless rooms, doing

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.320
unbelievably complicated mathematics,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.680
with absolutely no idea what's happening in the world.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.920
So I don't think that we're going

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.600
to make change from those spaces.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.240
I eventually decided

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.480
to try and move into the media space.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.680
I made that space in early 2020.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.840
And the idea was basically, you know,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.000
I've spent

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
5, 6 years now

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.560
trying to convince rich people to deal with inequality.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.120
I don't think they're going to do it.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.920
The people who are affected by and

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.880
and hurt by this economic crisis of inequality

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.320
are ordinary families, ordinary families like you,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.480
ordinary families like your kids.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.240
And I was hoping that in the media space,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.880
I might be able to basically

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.720
speak to the people who are being hurt.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.640
Speak to people who are being affected.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.600
Instead of speaking to,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.280
you know, the rich guys who are benefiting.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.920
And, that is really when I started to develop

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.480
the plan that I've been doing the last

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.960
four years, especially the last 2 or 3 years.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.760
Which is I genuinely think that the vast

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.400
majority of people in this country,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.720
and I think this is true if you're here

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.080
or in the States or in Europe or in Australia

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.160
do not have a single person

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.480
in the mainstream media

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.400
who is communicating

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.160
effectively, clearly, understandably,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.040
what is happening in this economic crisis

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.960
that is increasingly devastating living conditions

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.840
for millions of ordinary families across the world.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.120
And I started to feel that there was a massive gap,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.400
basically a huge gap,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.920
a huge gap to fill, basically telling people

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.560
what is happening.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.600
And I started to feel that really strongly

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600
during Covid,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.680
that basically the quality of our economics media

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.640
was extremely low.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.000
The quality of our politics

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.160
from an economics perspective was extremely low.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.400
And we were because of those failures,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.680
we were going to see a continuation of fall

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.880
in living standards.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.880
But we were going to see this

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.880
enormous unmet demand

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.480
for somebody who was simply talking about

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.840
and explaining

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.400
what is actually happening in the economy.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.200
Okay. So let's talk about

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.320
what is happening in

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.680
economics and politics.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.360
I think you basically have

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.960
two strands of economic thought

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.760
and two strands of political thought,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.320
which is you have this kind of

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.200
old school,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.960
the kind of dominant economic ideology of the last

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.360
30, 40 years,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.400
which is really,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.360
I think, personified

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.320
by the current Labour government,

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.400
which is if

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.680
we just do everything a little bit more efficiently,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.440
things will get better.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.320
There's no explicit focus on inequality at all.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.600
They often tend to focus on trying to change the system

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.280
in such a way that it benefits the rich,

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.320
which means inequality

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.200
tends to get worse over time,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.240
and living standards fall for the majority.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.960
While this kind of

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.800
semi elite group of politicians and economists

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.560
themselves are protected.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.080
And this is really clearly dying.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.360
You can see it in the complete collapse

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.160
in support for

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.280
almost all of the traditional centre

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.360
left and centre right parties across Europe.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.560
Those parties are only really hanging on in the UK

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.440
and the US

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.560
under systems

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.200
which basically make it

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.640
almost impossible to replace them.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.240
And you're seeing them,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.640
you're seeing even in those countries,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.240
those parties become extremely unpopular and die.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.880
That creates this massive, massive gap for new ideas.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.280
So I think we are here in this space now.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.160
There is a massive,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.560
massive popular demand for new ideas.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.960
And really,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.120
the political left has almost completely failed to put

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.480
any new ideas on the table.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.360
And that gap is

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.480
being filled by

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.760
a new political right,

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.440
which I think has been very effective

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.360
in doing things like utilising social media,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.960
utilising influencers,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.000
especially on the right

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.960
to basically sell a new political story.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.520
And they are, in a sense,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.520
taking advantage of the exact same thing

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.840
which I've just described to you,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.680
which is that politics is...

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.880
has failed, media has failed.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.320
There is massive demand for something which is new

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.880
because people know that the status quo is failing,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.000
and these guys are filling that gap

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.240
with ‘The problem is foreigners.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.640
The problem is immigrants’,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.320
and they will be very successful.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.240
You know, they clearly have taken power

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.760
of the US government.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.000
They will increasingly take control

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.240
of European governments.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.000
And they have taken control

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.320
of many European governments.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.040
They are successful,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.080
I think, not necessarily because they are

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.120
good.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.000
I think simply because no one else

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.440
has really tried to occupy that gap.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.680
I think there is

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.560
massive demand for a massive potential for

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.880
a simple message delivered to working people.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.240
The reason you are getting poor

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.680
is because your wealth is being squeezed out

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.000
by the rich and the super rich.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.720
They are taking their wealth from you.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.480
You are unable to compete with them.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.040
The working class is being bankrupted.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.200
The middle class is disappearing. Tax wealth not work.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.480
I honestly think we have a chance

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.520
of winning power on that.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.040
And I think in this country in the short term, our...

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.040
because we have this centrist party in power,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.000
our problem is how do we squeeze the centre on that?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.120
And I think the power we have

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.840
is that the centre is number one,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.200
phenomenally unpopular, and number two

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.320
will fail on the economy.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.040
So I think we really have power there.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.640
The longer term risk is not the centre

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.560
because I think the centre

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.720
will progressively lose popularity,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.120
but these new right ideas.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.200
The problem we have is that they will always be

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.120
much, much, much better funded than us.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.440
Quite simply because

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.640
once billionaires realise

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.840
that the long term battle is a battle between tax

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.320
the rich and blame the foreigners,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.800
the billionaires will increasingly aggressively fund

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.000
blame the foreigners as an idea.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
But we do also have a kind of trump card against this

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.080
new right,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.960
which is

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.680
when it comes to economic policy,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.080
almost all of these new right parties

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.200
want to slash taxes on rich people.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.080
And I think that's partly ideological.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.920
And I think it's partly

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.200
because they're funded by billionaires.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.240
And, you know, that's what the billionaires want,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.280
which means that even in the cases where these guys

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.840
do take power, and we've seen it

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.080
in some European countries, but,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.280
you know, most obviously

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.480
we've seen it recently in the US.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.200
These guys will also preside over

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.000
an increase

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.360
in wealth inequality,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.440
which will mean, again,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.080
a squeeze of assets away from the middle class,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.760
away from the working class,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.080
and further falls in ordinary families

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.160
living conditions.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.400
So these guys, whilst they will be very well-funded

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.640
and they are very clearly in the ascendancy,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.960
they have a really, really serious weakness,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400
which is they are literally

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.040
impoverishing their own supporters.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.200
But this is not just the weakness

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.280
of the political right.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.680
This is also the weakness of the political centre.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.720
You know, I put a video out

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.240
a few weeks ago saying,

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.480
Trump and Labour will both fail

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.880
because they will both allow wealth

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.960
inequality to increase,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.840
which means the squeezing out of wealth

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.200
from ordinary families to the rich.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.040
And as much as,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.880
you know, this movement is small

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.800
and it's it's almost completely unfunded,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.000
the power that we have is

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.320
both of our competitors are actively impoverishing

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.840
their voter base,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.120
aggressively impoverishing their voter base.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.160
So I think we really, really

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.640
have a chance

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.200
by pushing

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.960
a single message

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.560
again and again and again,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.000
wealth inequality is what is making you poor.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.680
The only way to protect your families from poverty

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.720
is to get the wealth back from the very rich.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.880
That means fixing a broken tax system

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.360
which taxes you at higher rates than them.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.960
It means changing the tax system

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.400
to tax them more, to tax you less.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.880
Tax wealth, not work.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.560
Now, I want to make it clear,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.760
because I'm in the business of predictions,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.400
what will happen if we don't get this onto the table.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.520
If we don't get this idea onto the table,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.880
then we will be left with, essentially

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.800
the two voices on the table that are already there,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.000
which is one

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.960
this kind of tired old centrism where we just say

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.440
business, business, business,

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.400
growth, growth, growth,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.880
entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.840
entrepreneurship to ourselves again and again

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.920
a million times, whilst

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.800
we impoverish the working class.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.360
And this new right idea of the problem is immigrants,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.600
the problem is foreigners.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.800
And because you have only two basic ideas on the table,

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.560
what you will have is you will get one party in power.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.120
So for example, in this country

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.480
we currently have the boring centrists in power.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.680
They will oversee a growth in inequality

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.160
and they will become very unpopular

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.960
and they will be replaced

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.480
by a ‘The problem is foreigners’ party and ‘the problem

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.280
is foreigners’ party will also

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.880
watch inequality

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.000
grow and they will eventually become unpopular

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.360
and people will vote the boring centrists in again.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.320
And what you will see

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.880
here is

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.920
the right wing party ‘the problem is foreigners’

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.000
party has space to move into,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.200
which is they can say, okay,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.840
the reason we failed was because we weren't

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.200
hard enough on foreigners.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.280
They can rebrand

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.480
and they can come in further to the right.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.880
And this is basically exactly what we saw

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880
in this country.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.160
You know,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.480
we had

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.840
David Cameron, who was this kind of essentially

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.800
a boring centrist,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.320
and he was replaced

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.360
briefly by Theresa May,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.280
but eventually by Boris Johnson,

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.720
who was essentially,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.160
a re flanking to the right of the political right,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160
which is, you know, we don't want to...

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.920
he really was replacing of a boring

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.640
centrist with ‘the problem is foreigners.’

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.680
And when he lost he was replaced by,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.280
very briefly

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.040
Liz Truss, who again was flanked further to the right.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.600
And when she immediately crashed the economy,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.680
we again got boring centrist Rishi Sunak.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.440
And he was replaced by boring centrist Keir Starmer.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.760
And what you are seeing now in

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.040
this country is the growth of Nigel Farage,

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.120
who is again the political right

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.960
moving to the right.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.320
And you see the same thing in the US.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.280
So in the US you have Donald Trump.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.400
He is a ‘the problem is foreigners’ politician.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.080
He will fail.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.080
He could be followed by another boring centrist,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.880
or he could be followed

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.000
by another new sort

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.880
of rebranding of the political right,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.640
which is what we need to do is, is be more extreme

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.560
on the right.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.920
And,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.800
billionaires will probably be funding these,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.920
these new right wing parties

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.560
because they see them

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.920
as protecting them from taxing the rich.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.280
And what you’ll see is eventually

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.480
these right wing parties

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.160
will become more and more extreme,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.320
because it's the only way

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.480
you can keep winning elections,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.640
when you keep failing on the economy.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.200
What you are being

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.600
popular for is blaming foreigners and immigrants,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.440
and if you're not succeeding on the economy,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.200
you can just, you can keep doubling down on that.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.000
You have space to the right to go into,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.800
whereas the centre kind of have nowhere to go.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.000
They'll become increasingly unpopular.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.600
So, I think we have to be realistic about this.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.200
That leads you over a period of time

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.160
from what might may initially have been sensible

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.640
seeming, ‘the problem is foreigners’ politics

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.520
closer and closer and closer to real fascism.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.840
I mean, that is...

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.720
that is where it goes.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.160
And I'm not saying Farage is a fascist,

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.280
I'm not saying Trump is a fascist.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.920
That is where it will go over time.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.240
This is exactly what happened

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.520
in the early 20th century.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.880
That is what will happen

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.480
if we do not get a new voice on the table.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.280
And I think it's worth

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.160
seeing and thinking about that for a minute,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.200
because I know we,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.760
we live in countries, you know, here in the UK,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.840
but I know we've got a growing US viewership,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.680
we live in countries

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.360
where politics is increasingly factional

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.920
and people who view themselves as on the left

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.720
hate people who view themselves as on the right.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.760
People who view themselves as on the right,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.000
hate people who view themselves as on the left.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
The way this will go will be a...

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.840
I was going to say slow,

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.040
but it could become increasingly quick,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.480
slide into fascism

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.400
whilst both of you,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.520
those of you who view yourselves

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.440
as on the left

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.880
and those of you who view yourselves as on the right,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.280
will slide further

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.800
and further and further into poverty.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.880
So I think it's really,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880
really important

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.920
that you recognise neither of these groups

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.280
are going to give you what you need,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.000
which is your houses back

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.280
and your ability to be able to have a family. Okay. So

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.920
this is a

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:36.920
fight which I genuinely believe we can win.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.760
Not because we are strong

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.680
and not because we are well-funded,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.600
but quite simply

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:48.600
because we are competing with two political ideologies

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.400
which are both bankrupting the public,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.600
bankrupting 80%, 90% of the public.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.120
And that makes them

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.640
very weak to a campaign

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.560
which basically simply reveals

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.960
the truth of what is happening,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.080
which is the reason you are getting poor,

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.560
is because the rich are eating your cake.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.800
They are squeezing you out.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.000
They are taking your assets.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.920
They're driving a family into poverty.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.280
The power that we have is...

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.920
really we've got two powers.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.560
One, we are the only voice

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.560
which will protect ordinary people from poverty.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.680
And two, we have strength in numbers.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.840
This is genuinely in the financial interests

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.600
of the vast majority of people,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.400
both on the political left and on the political right.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.400
This works for them financially.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.480
So I genuinely believe this is a fight we can win.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.800
The problem is, we're not fighting it.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.680
There's just not enough people

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.960
getting this idea into the public domain.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.440
And I want to talk a little bit about two ideas.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.160
One is the Overton window

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.040
and the other is message discipline.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.040
So the Overton window is an idea in,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.240
I guess, in politics

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.000
that there's a kind of window of ideas

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.360
which are considered

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.840
acceptable, sensible, normal,

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.800
non extreme at a given point in time.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.320
We've got some videos on this channel.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.480
Maybe I'll link one in the description

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.360
talking about why economists

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.920
don't talk about wealth inequality.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.880
The vast majority of economists are rich people

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.720
who are not being hurt by this.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.000
They are benefiting from it,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.280
and they do not think inequality is the problem.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.560
That means that at the moment,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.960
focusing on and centralising inequality,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.920
wealth inequality as the core problem,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.320
is not popular with economists,

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.200
and it's outside the Overton window.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.320
This really is the key challenge that we have.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.640
And people sometimes ask me, you know,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.680
why don't Labour talk to you?

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.560
Why don't Labour get this idea in their manifesto?

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:01.280
Really, it comes down to very simply that answer.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.920
This is outside the Overton window.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.480
The group of people in this country

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.760
and in most countries across the world who decide

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.560
what is acceptable, what is sensible, what is wise,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.560
is a very small group of rich and posh people.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.280
And they've decided that this

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.560
idea is simply unacceptable.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.920
We need to push back on that.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.000
But in order to do that, we need message discipline.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.520
So this is the second concept I want to introduce.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.600
Message discipline is again another political idea.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.320
This is the reason why when when politicians go on TV,

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.320
they're always unbelievably, painfully boring,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.800
which is that they get told by their political party

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.320
if this subject comes up, you have to say this.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.880
And when they go on the TV,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.320
they're not really thinking, what's my opinion on that?

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.240
What do I think about that?

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.160
They're thinking,

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.520
what has my political

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.760
party told me to say about this issue?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.320
And for that reason, when politicians go on TV,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.840
they all say the exact same thing

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.000
again and again and again and again and again

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.600
and the reason they do

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.800
this is this is how you get an idea

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.320
into the Overton window.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.320
If you say an idea again and again and again

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320
and again, and it's important

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.880
that a variety of people say it.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.120
And then you guys out there

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.680
hear 25 different

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.840
posh looking, smart sounding people

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.080
saying the same idea ‘the problem is immigrants,

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.840
the problem is immigrants,

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.720
the problem is immigrants’ on the TV,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.880
then you start to believe that idea.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.400
This is how

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360
an idea goes from being crazy, wacky,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.520
unbelievable, no, no way true, to being common sense.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.800
An idea travels from being absolutely outrageous

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.000
to being commonly accepted as common sense

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.240
simply by lots of people

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.800
saying it again and again

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.520
and again and again and again.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.160
Now, I'm not a political party.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.360
We don't have a political party.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.960
We will and are trying to influence

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.280
the political parties.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.560
What I have is this YouTube channel, and you.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:56.560
And we need to start using this message discipline now.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.920
I need to keep saying, and you need to keep saying,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.040
and you need to get your friends

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.920
and your family to keep saying,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.640
obviously, the reason why you guys are getting poor

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.600
is because of growing wealth inequality.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.120
And you can choose when you push that message,

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.280
either to use my name and my videos or not.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.040
So you can go to your friends and family and say,

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.120
hey, look, there's this guy, Garys Economics,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.800
I think he's explained it really, really well.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.560
I think if you watch his videos, it's really compelling

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.600
that actually the reason for growing poverty

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.800
is inequality.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.800
I think it's important that you, to stress this,

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.920
you increasingly say it's obviously true

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.240
because it is obviously true.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.080
Obviously, you cannot squeeze

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.640
all of the wealth out of the middle class

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.920
and not expect poverty.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.200
You cannot concentrate the wealth

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.960
into an unbelievably small group of people

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.360
and not expect poverty.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.560
These things are obviously true,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.320
and we need to make it understood

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.040
that they're obviously true by saying them again

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.520
and again and again and again.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.200
And when I say you can use this channel or not

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.480
use this channel,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.680
what I mean is,

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.080
if you think it's the best way to convince someone

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.520
to send that podcast

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.320
or to send them to our Understanding

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.120
the Economy series, do that.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.400
But I think one weakness that we have,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.440
one weakness that I have

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.040
is that this channel is called Garys Economics.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.960
The logo is like my face

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.440
and it's become very attached to my personal brand.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.320
It's very, very important

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.000
that these ideas are not 100% attached to

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.520
‘these are Gary Stephenson's ideas’,

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.320
because it's easy to take out one guy, basically,

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.520
I know how this is going to work.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.880
If this keeps growing at the way...

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.560
at the rate that it’s growing,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.880
I will get attacked more and more

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.880
and more and more and more by the press, by the media.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.280
And eventually these guys will land the punch

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.280
that's going to land, and I will probably be gone,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.080
and I understand that's how it works.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.040
It's important

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.800
that rather than just saying

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.120
“Go watch Garys Economics”,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.400
that you start understanding these ideas yourself

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.240
and talking about them

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.080
as your ideas, as ideas that are obviously true,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.160
that you understand

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.120
it's really, really important

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.880
that we have a diversity of voices saying this

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.920
and that it's not just me, it's not just me.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.920
And that brings me to another weakness that we have,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.600
which is,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:10.160
we need broader buy in from powerful spaces.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.840
So what I mean when I say that is, I decided

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.000
very consciously to move to a YouTube channel

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.200
as opposed to writing for The Guardian, for example,

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.200
because I felt that

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.800
it would be meaningful to working class people

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.280
to see and hear somebody

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.680
from a working class background

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.560
speaking about the economy.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.360
And I think that is one of the reasons

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.520
why this channel has been popular.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.280
I think that's one of the reasons

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.480
why the book is popular,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.880
because working class people

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.480
really want to see somebody from the same place

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.720
as them, speaking about the economy.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.000
That makes me a powerful communicator

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.320
to ordinary people, to the working class.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.960
But it really, really

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.800
hurts me

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.600
when I'm trying to communicate

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.320
to people in positions of power.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.280
So when I say that,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.800
I mean high level politicians

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.280
or really any politicians, people

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.440
in the media, high level economists,

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.880
central bankers, people in think tanks,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.760
people in the civil service,

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.040
you know, there's this,

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.680
it’s a relatively small group of people

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.400
who control the levers of power.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.520
And almost all of them

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.680
are rich, posh people

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.000
that come from rich, posh schools.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.160
And they don't like me.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.560
They don't like the way that I look.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.040
They don't like the way that I sound.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.360
They don't like the way that I come out of nowhere

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.000
having made a ton of money and say,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.880
you guys are all idiots, you guys are all wrong.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.200
And that's very understandable.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.440
That's very, very understandable.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.360
So we need and what I need you to do if you can,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.560
is to act as a go between.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.760
Basically, you act on two levels.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.480
Which is number one,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.640
you really make this common sense wisdom

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.720
on the streets amongst ordinary

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.680
British men and women or American men and women,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.600
if that's where you are.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.360
Get everybody to understand it.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.840
But if you are able to get into positions of power

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.600
or influence people in positions of power,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.480
politicians, media, influencers,

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.000
celebrities, you know, love to get Carol Vorderman

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.360
on the channel if you're interested.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.120
Civil service, academics,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.760
if you can get into these spaces

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.760
or influence these spaces,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.280
especially if you sound less working class than me,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.760
I need people like you to act as go betweens

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.920
and don't go in there and say, “Oh, Garys

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.920
Economics is really smart and you guys are idiots.”

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.560
Go in there and speak in your posh voice and say,

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.960
hey, I think this idea is,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.400
I think this idea,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.640
this poverty could be caused by inequality.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.160
We need academics saying it.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.680
We need people on the political left saying it.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.360
We need people like these think tanks saying it.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.320
We really, really, really need more diversity of voice.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.640
We are all part of this conversation.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.800
So I need you to boost the ideas, boost

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.600
the videos, boost the channels,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.400
but also start trying

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.080
to spread them, trying to understand myself.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.800
I want to see

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.520
academics at Oxford or at Harvard

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.000
or at Cambridge or LSE writing papers saying

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.040
we think the reason for growing inequality,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.920
before growing poverty is growing inequality.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.880
I need other people saying it, other people

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.080
saying it, with voices like that, it can't just be me.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.680
And if we do that,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.760
I think we can win.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.040
I think we can win.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.600
You know,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.000
I've been doing this for a long time,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.400
and I never expected it to kind of grow

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.640
at this unbelievable pace that it is growing.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.000
And it's

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.680
quite scary for me, to be honest,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.120
to see the, like, the growth on the channel and

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120
the book's been number one

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.000
for six weeks now and I just...

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.480
yeah, I get recognised all the time.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.960
It's scary and it's weird.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.480
But basically I was always convinced that

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.440
a simple true message,

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.080
which could continually be reproving

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.720
by predicting better than the mainstream media,

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.280
predicting better than the mainstream politicians

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.760
would be believed by the public, and

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.000
I think it's starting to be proven to be true.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.400
So my message to you guys is

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.880
get on board, start singing from the same hymn sheet.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.400
Get some message discipline.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.880
If you're out there in the political left,

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.440
ask your political party you’re

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.160
associated with or your think tank you're in,

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.000
or the groups you're associated in,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.600
why are we not talking about inequality

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.480
as the cause for poverty?

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.320
Why are we not saying that?

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.600
If you're on the political right,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.880
if you’re a member of the Conservative Party,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.120
if you're a Reform voter,

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.160
ask them, why are they not saying that?

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.600
You know, this is not a left or right issue.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.840
This is a poverty issue.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.120
This is going to happen in every country.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.480
And it doesn't matter who's in charge.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.320
Both Donald Trump and Labour

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.400
are presiding over increasing inequality.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.440
You know, call in to LBC, ask them,

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.600
you know why you're not talking about inequality.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.160
Inequality is blowing up.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.560
Stock markets are all time highs.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.400
The rich are richer than they've ever been.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.160
And yet ordinary families can't turn the heating on.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.200
You know, make it common sense.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.720
Of course it's inequality. Of course it's inequality.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.400
Say it again and again.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.040
Share it.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.400
Share it with your friends. Share it with your family.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.680
Share it with anyone who has any position of power.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.960
You know, call into the call in shows.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.320
Make this the new common sense.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.160
And I guess this brings me to the final point,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.560
which is a lot of people

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.480
want concrete actions.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.360
They say to me, “What can I do, Gary? What can I do?

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.920
You freaked me out. You scared me.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.720
What can I do?”

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.800
And I want to finish this video by trying my best

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.000
to give, like a really clear

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.720
answer to that question of what can you do?

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.080
The first thing I want you to do,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.120
is take a big breath in, and a big breath out

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.920
and recognise

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.760
this economic situation, is an economic situation

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.480
that is going to get worse.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.360
It is an economic situation that is going to get worse.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.600
This situation of

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.880
dislike of immigrants,

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.680
dislike of foreigners is also a situation

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.000
that is going to get worse.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.400
Both of those things

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.560
are going to affect different people differently.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.960
You know, if you are not the poorest, think about

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.120
how that's going to affect people poorer than you.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.440
If you are not on the sharp

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.280
end of the anti-immigrant, anti-foreigner hatred,

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.760
think about how it's going to affect people who are.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.520
The reason I say those things is twofold.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.400
The first one is,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.400
I need you to be ready emotionally for the difficult

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.160
and divisive times that are coming,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.800
because if you are angry,

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.920
if you are frightened, if you are scared,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.440
I can't do nothing with you.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.000
I can't do nothing with you.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.680
I want to tell another quick story

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.840
from when I went on Piers Morgan a few weeks ago.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.240
So when I went on, piers was running like quite late.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.560
Like an hour, maybe like an hour, 20 minutes late,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.840
which meant I had to sit in the green room

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.000
with Dave Rubin and his entourage for

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.800
an hour and 20 minutes.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.200
They're very nice.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.040
And while we were in the green room, we could,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.000
we could see on a big TV the interviews

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
that Piers Morgan was doing.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.600
And,

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.720
I don't watch Piers Morgan's channel normally,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.840
but I watched these

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.920
about an hour of interviews,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.960
I think it was two interviews before I went on, and

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.600
I could see what they were doing, right.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.160
They have their left wing head

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.360
and they have their right wing head.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.520
And both the interviews before mine,

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.160
they had

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.560
the left wing heads were all black

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.480
and the right wing heads were all white.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.520
And they tried to say things to make that left

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.080
wing head angry,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.920
to make them, to make them lose their temper.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.000
When I was on, they wanted to get...

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.840
I think there was a, there was a transsexual who,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.200
they were trying to get her angry about

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.160
the Olympics or something.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.160
Just trying to get her to say something outrageous.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.760
Tried to get her to lose her temper.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.640
Then they looked at the audience...

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.720
They looked at the audience and say, look,

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.920
this is what those people are like.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.960
And what they're trying to do is, is cause division.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.360
They're trying to cause division.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.920
They're trying to make you hate each other.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.240
They're trying to make you angry.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.800
They're trying to make you think those guys out

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.840
there are your enemy.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.200
And when I say that,

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.760
I'm not just talking to the political right,

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.920
I'm talking to the political left as well.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.120
They want you to hate each other.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.840
They want you to be angry.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.800
Listen, here in the UK, in the US, all over the world,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.720
the working class is multiracial,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.440
it's multi-ethnic, it includes

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.400
men and women

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.640
includes people who own house, 

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.520
people who don't own houses.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.600
If you hate each other,

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.560
if the men hate the women and the women hate the men,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.280
and the white people hate the nonwhite people in the

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.000
not white people hate the white people,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.400
I can't do nothing with you.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.000
We will never be able to stand together.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.280
We will never be able to fight.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.880
We'll never be able to win.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.040
The power that we have is that there's more of us.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.520
That is a power we only use if we fight together.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.240
We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be frightened,

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.600
to be scared, or to hate each other.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.840
The second thing is, I need you guys

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.520
to be prepared for a long fight.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.800
We don't win this tomorrow,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.040
we don't win it the next day,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.120
we don't win this next week,

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.000
we don't win this next year. Okay?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.040
Your grandparents, your great-grandparents,

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.360
your great-great-grandparents

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.000
fought for generations

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.680
for the kind of ability

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.000
you have to own assets

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.880
and that your parents had to own assets.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.360
This is not a fight we win quickly.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.960
The reason that I say that is that I know

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.800
people want me to arrange

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.200
some kind of march on Parliament.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.720
We talk about this a lot.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.280
I don't want to get you guys to go

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.360
crazy, email

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.440
your MP every day, march on Parliament,

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.720
use all your energy,

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.960
and then be a situation

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.560
where we're not in a position to get anything.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.440
I don't want you guys to be disappointed.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.040
This is a long fight.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.760
You need to conserve your energy for a marathon,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.280
not a sprint. Okay?

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.120
We build,

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.280
we build, we build, we build, we build, we build,

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.520
and then we go together and we win.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.760
When we have enough power, we can win the argument.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.520
We are fighting against two political ideologies,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.960
which will definitely drive your family

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.480
and your kids families into poverty.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.040
They've got nothing to offer you.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.560
The argument is there, the argument is simple.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.880
We need to get wealth back

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.600
into the hands of ordinary families.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.120
That means taxing working people

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.760
less and rich people more.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.480
Tax wealth, not work, protect ordinary families,

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.040
make it common sense.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.000
Tell your friends.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.360
Tell your families. Build the movement.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.440
Support other people who are saying the same things.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.960
Be that person yourself.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.920
We need more voices singing off the same hymn sheet.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.360
We can win this argument.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.400
Win the argument, you get the power,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.640
you change the tax system

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.320
and then you get your assets back. And that

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.960
is how we stop the economy from collapsing.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.080
Good luck. Thank you.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.720
Send it to your mum. Send your friends, to your family.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.640
Good luck.
