00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.600
OK welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.080
today we are going to predict the UK budget

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.600
two and a half months in advance

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.320
OK so, I was going to do a video this week about how to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.840
convince your friends we need wealth taxes

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.840
but I'm gonna push that back to next week

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.600
because something has happened in the last one week

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.000
two weeks that I think is sufficiently important

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
that we need to talk about it now

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.440
so that we can get ahead of it

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.800
in advance of the UK budget. Alright

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080
so for those of you who don't know

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.640
the UK budget comes once a year

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.560
it's normally about the end of October

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.200
so it's not gonna happen for another two and a half

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.640
three months. When it happens

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.200
there's always a stupid media sh*t show

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.000
and we always have argument here where I say

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.040
I'm not covering the budget

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.360
because it's a waste of time

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.600
nothing important happens

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960
but this year I think something very

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.400
very interesting is going to happen in the UK budget

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.280
and I think it's important we get ahead of it.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
If you are watching not from the UK

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.040
this is going to be very very relevant for you as well

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.600
because what is happening in the UK budget

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.200
is a good way of understanding

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.400
a massive thing that is happening

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.480
not just in the UK

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.640
but in every country in the western world

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.360
and what is happening here will happen in your country

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.840
very very soon.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.760
OK so as you know

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.560
one of the big goals of Gary's Economics summer

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.400
autumn season 2025 is I'm trying to infiltrate

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.840
elite UK institutions because I think we're gonna need

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
some level of support from elite institutions

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.240
in order to get the wealth taxes that we need

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.200
so in the last month really

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600
but especially the last two weeks

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.960
I've been cycling all around Westminster

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.000
meeting lots and lots of different people

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.280
trying to see whether we can get

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.600
support for wealth taxes

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.640
trying to understand what we need and in doing so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.480
I have learned

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.480
a little bit about what is gonna happen in the UK

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.800
budget. Now usually when I was a trader

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.080
I always found it interesting how the UK budgets were

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.200
often really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800
not particularly market relevant

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.520
they didn't really move the markets

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.840
and what that means in my opinion

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.360
is basically nothing very important happens

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.480
and policy very rarely changes in the budget

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.800
but we, I think

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.040
are gonna see some really interesting things

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.360
in the budget this year and the big topline picture is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.880
that there are going to be significant

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.760
increases on taxation of the middle class

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.800
and when I say the middle class

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640
I mean that in the British sense which

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.840
confusingly is kind of the top 20% but not the top 1%.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360
Now this is very interesting

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.200
because the UK

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.960
Labour government

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.440
came into power on a very strong promise

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.400
that we are not going to raise any taxes and yet now

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160
just one year into that government

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.440
it looks like we are probably gonna get a significant

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.080
increase in taxes which will probably be extremely

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.520
politically disastrous

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.560
 for this already very unpopular government

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.480
so why is this government that is already very unpopular

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.200
and promised not to raise taxes

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240
going to raise taxes on the middle class?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.480
OK so what we are gonna do here is we're gonna do

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.600
basically a description of what it means to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.760
run your wealth down, you overspend your income

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.240
such that your wealth deteriorates

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.160
which is

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.440
basically what the governments have been doing in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.480
the UK, the US, really all across the western world

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720
especially since the 80s

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.880
and I want you to understand how

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.080
that provides the context

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.600
of how you reach a point where the government

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.240
basically has no choice

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.760
but to sort of go for certain groups in society

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.680
and we're gonna

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.960
use that through the example of an individual person

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400
which is maybe not the perfect example

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.360
but I think it does does describe what's happening

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.400
and it's important context

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.000
why the government is doing what it's doing now

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000
okay so let's say

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.560
like the government in the post war period

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.800
you start off with a lot of wealth

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.280
so let's say £1 million

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.360
if you have a million pounds of wealth

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.680
you're gonna get some income from that wealth

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.760
so you normally make about 5%

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.200
so if you have a million pounds of wealth

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.360
then you're gonna make something like 50k

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.040
£50,000 a year in your wealth income

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160
your passive income from your wealth.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280
Government also has like its income from taxation

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.160
which the equivalent for a person is a work income

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.800
let's make that 50k as well

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.080
to keep things nice and simple

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.200
so you got good income 50k a year wealth income 50k

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.240
work income 50k but your policy is to

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.600
you're gonna run this wealth down

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.800
you're gonna spend more than your income

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.040
so instead of spending 100k

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.600
which is your income you're gonna spend 200k

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.960
bit more there right so spending more

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.760
and then obviously

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.280
the consequence of spending more than your income

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280
is that your wealth goes down

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.280
so next year you have only 900k

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.480
wealth less than a million

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.400
and obviously because your wealth is less now

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.000
your passive income from wealth is now less

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.480
so instead of making 50k

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.400
you're gonna make only 45k

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.280
your work income is the same

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.680
I'm gonna drop these pound signs

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.840
to make it a bit clearer

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.960
you should be a bit worried

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.000
cause your income's less now

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.400
you're intentionally planning to run this wealth down

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.960
so let's run it down a bit more

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160
and you're gonna keep spending 200k

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.360
what happens then is of course that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.000
your wealth falls again

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.600
and because your income is less

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.240
now your wealth falls not just by 100k

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.440
but 105k so now you go down to 795k

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.040
and your wealth income falls even further

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.200
this now falls another 5k plus a little bit more

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.560
so this drops it is 39.75k

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.000
this stays the same your spelling stays the same

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.400
cause you keep running it down

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.960
and next year this falls

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.480
see this fall was 105 this fall was just 100

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.680
this fall is 105

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.280
and now you're gonna fall just over 110

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.640
it's like 110 point something

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.280
and it's gonna drop down to 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.800
684 point something

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.400
and what you should see is that the wealth

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.160
wealth is not only falling over time

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.360
but the speed of the wealth fall is falling

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.280
so your wealth is falling in an accelerated way

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.480
which is kind of worrying

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.880
you can keep running this down

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.360
and eventually you'll hit zero

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.880
once your wealth hits zero

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880
which we kind of hit

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.480
we were in this kind of period after 2008

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.600
before the Covid crisis now your wealth income is zero

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.560
your work your work income is 50

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.400
but it's hard now right

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.360
because you're used to spending 200 a year

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.480
and especially we hit this point in Covid

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.400
where even though our wealth,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.800
the government wealth had fallen to effectively zero

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.840
we had to keep spending because of Covid

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.560
we used to spending 200 a year

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.840
so we actually kept spending

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.240
and in fact

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.600
during Covid we we we started to spend even more

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.280
but we started to overspend even with no wealth left

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.760
and we started to run into debt

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.640
which means after Covid

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.800
you're in a kind of situation where your wealth 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.280
goes down as far as say minus 500 in this example

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.600
then your wealth income can become negative

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.960
like not only do you have no wealth

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.360
but you have to pay interest on your debt to the rich

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360
so now this is minus 25

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.240
your working income is still 50

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.080
but you wanna spend 200 but eventually

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.800
the people who are lending you this money

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.160
which is rich people

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.040
they start seeing what if this keeps going down

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.480
we're not getting any real wealth anymore

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.600
all we're getting is debt interest

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.640
eventually if we keep lending these guys money

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.000
they're not gonna be able to pay it back

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.400
eventually you hit this floor where the gov....

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.800
where the rich refuse to keep lending you this money

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.360
and suddenly you cannot do this anymore

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.960
you cannot overspend your income

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.960
because you have no more wealth to sell

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.680
you're not allowed to borrow any more money

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.040
so you suddenly have to bring this into balance

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400
which means now the max you can spend is 50, -25

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.360
which is 25

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.000
so you have to suddenly aggressively drop your spending

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.800
now obviously

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.840
this is a, you know,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.400
a stylised example to exaggerate what is happening

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.240
but what I wanna point out here is that

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.800
this naivety to

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.520
the aggressive falls in government wealth

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.680
leads to a situation where obviously inevitably

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480
eventually you will run out of wealth

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.000
and you will have to aggressively reduce your spending

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.240
and you know this is true not just of governments

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.440
this is also true what's happened to the working class

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.000
you know

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.400
it's obvious to be reminded of what happened during

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.880
for example the the sale of the council houses

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.160
if you sell your assets

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.480
and those assets are not accumulated by the public

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.840
but are accumulated by the rich

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.400
you will eventually hit a point

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.560
where you have to aggressively reduce your spending

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.720
and when that happens, what are you gonna do?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.400
You have a number of options

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400
and we will talk about those options now.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.400
So now, let's get like a fresh sheet

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.440
so now we wanna talk about like

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.920
what the government can do

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.400
and for a long time

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.720
the government was basically funding its spending

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.880
by borrowing more or selling assets

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.480
in either cases you're running your wealth down

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.400
now the UK

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.360
government has hit the point

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.560
where this is not an option

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.600
and other governments

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.960
in the western world will hit this point

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.760
very soon

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.160
that leaves you with basically four things you can do

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.040
No. 1

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.000
and the thing which we constantly campaign for is

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.040
tax the rich. Don't tax the workers, tax the super rich

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.160
these are the guys who have the assets now

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.240
these are the guys who have the government wealth now

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.200
these are the guys who have the working class wealth

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.840
now and are getting the middle class wealth

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.400
this is what I constantly campaign for

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.720
you should tax the rich

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.760
but our government most western governments

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.560
are extremely reluctant to do it

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.400
so what other options do you have?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.280
No. 2 is you tax the poor

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.000
now for a long time after World War 2

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.880
ordinary people the working class people

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.720
poorer people did have some wealth

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.000
but that's gone now

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.400
there's no way you can tax these guys more

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.760
there's nothing to take you know

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.920
you cannot like tax an empty bucket

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.560
no wealth here that's not possible

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.200
number three is you can try to slash the welfare state

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.600
obviously here in the UK we had 14 years of a

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.000
what is called austerity, conservative austerity.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.760
If you're watching from the US

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.320
you're moving into your slash the welfare state period now

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.600
it doesn't feel great for the poor

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.360
but there's a degree to which you can do it.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.080
We've already done it loads in the UK

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.040
the UK government, the Labour government now

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.680
tried to do that earlier this year

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.000
they wanted to slash spending on disabled people

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.200
and their own politicians basically blocked it

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.880
which means now Labour does not have this option

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.880
which means you are left with only one possible option

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.400
other than tax the rich

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.040
which is to tax the middle class

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.560
and when I say the middle class

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.280
I mean it in the UK sense

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.040
which is basically higher earning workers

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.440
or non super rich asset owners

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.440
and if you watch our video

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.360
the squeeze out you will see that

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.880
that this is basically what happens

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.280
If you allow these wealthy people to rapidly grow

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.680
their share of the pie, first the poor lose their assets

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.400
then the government lose their assets

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.560
and the welfare state goes

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.800
and then you are left finally

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.840
with this choice that our UK government has now

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.480
your government will have very soon

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.280
which is you only have two options

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.000
do you tax the rich? Or do you tax the middle class?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.360
and I'm here campaigning for tax the rich

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.680
but the truth is

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.360
most governments at the moment

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.880
seem to feel like

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.600
their only option is to tax the middle class

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.680
so that is what you are you will get

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.000
that is what we will get in October

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.440
and that is what you will get in your country

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.440
very soon.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.200
This is a very important moment for you

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.800
and for the country okay

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.440
billionaire owned media

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.280
will try to portray this taxing of the middle class

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.600
of richer people

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.160
as a battle between the middle class and the poor

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
they do not want you to realize that

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.160
the reason the middle class are being taxed

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.840
is because the government is aggressively

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.200
stubbornly and stupidly unwilling to tax the rich

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.600
a battle is going to continue here

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.800
which has been going on already for a long time

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.560
which is that 

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.120
the poor and the working class are being bankrupted

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.360
the welfare state is being shut down

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.200
in the absence of taxation of the rich

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.560
the middle class will inevitably be eaten next

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.600
you cannot have an aggressively

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.120
expanding wealth of the very rich

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.600
in economies that are not growing quickly

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.760
without gradually displacing every single

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.680
other section of society including the middle class.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.680
If you do not get systems in place

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.680
such that you can tax the very rich

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.680
whilst their wealth is aggressively growing

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.760
every single group of society

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.240
including the middle class

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.800
will be destroyed. 

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.400
But what the rich want to do

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.480
is to separate out the middle class

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.640
so that the middle class

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.080
form an alliance with the rich

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.200
and think that

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.440
if we simply support and stand by the rich

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.640
for long enough we will be protected

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.160
whilst all of the pain will be felt by the poor.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.200
That is not going to happen

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.000
if the middle class

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.560
do not form an alliance with the poor

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.640
they will be eaten by the rich

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.960
simply basically

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.520
by the virtue of maths and compound interest.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.120
The poor have been f**ked for a long time

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.400
the government is being destroyed next

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.400
the government has nothing left now

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.800
there is only two options available now

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.520
either you tax the rich

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.080
or you allow the rich to eat the middle class

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.440
I'm here speaking now to the middle class of Britain

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.200
to the middle class

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.120
of countries across the western world

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.680
what choice do you want?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.040
Whose side are you going to be on?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.120
Are you going to support the rich

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.160
who will outcompete you and your kids

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.200
for the things that you need

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.280
for housing for financial security

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.200
or are you going to stand with the working classes

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.280
of your countries

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.000
to protect the wealth that your grandparents

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.240
and your great grandparents fought so hard to get

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.160
for the ordinary people of the UK

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.400
and the country in which you live.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.120
You're gonna hear a lot about this in October

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.240
I'm telling you right here

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.000
right now, October

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.200
is going to be another big step in a class warfare

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.040
that has been going on for a long time

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.000
and the people who are winning are the very

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
very rich. Their wealth share is aggressively

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.240
aggressively aggressively expanding

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.800
that is what is making it impossible

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.840
for ordinary people

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.400
like you and your kids and your grandkids

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.640
to own property

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.680
they are going to try to portray this as a battle

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.720
between the middle class and the working classes

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.760
between the middle class and the poor.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.640
If you accept that battle

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.400
then you will ally with the exact people

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.480
who are going to take away the wealth that you need.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.080
Go back and watch the video

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.480
‘The Squeeze Out’, because everything

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.480
that I said would happen in ‘The Squeeze Out’

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.560
is what is about to happen in October.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.280
Listen, there's only a certain amount of resources

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.200
in this country

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.760
there's only a certain amount of resources

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.760
in this world. If you allow this super

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.760
super rich to grow and grow and grow and grow

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.520
their resources you will lose your share.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.520
What I wanna make clear is

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.160
I think that what I do on this channel

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.280
is very often mischaracterized

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.280
largely by billionaires and by billionaire owned media

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.600
or billionaire owned bot farms in Russia

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.840
When I say tax the rich. When I say tax wealth not work

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I am doing that not just to protect working people

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.240
but also to protect the middle class.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.160
They constantly say

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.240
what Gary wants is to tax high earning working people

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.680
despite the fact that I constantly aggressively

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.200
very clearly say I am trying to tax the very rich

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.400
the wealth hoarders

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.360
the asset hoarders to protect working people

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.400
including high earning working people.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.080
If you are a high earning working person

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.160
if you are a working person who has a very powerful job

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.000
you have influence in something like government

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.680
politics, media

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.400
think tanks, academia

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.800
I want you to look very hard at the situation you're in

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800
right now. What are you gonna do?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.480
Are you gonna stand by me

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.640
the person who says tax wealth not work

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.040
or are you gonna stand by the billionaire media

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.800
that is gonna raise your taxes and take your wealth.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.480
Alright so that's it

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.680
that's the budget two and a half months in advance

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.600
it is gonna be another step forward in a class warfare

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.160
which is rapidly progressing.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200
Listen, there's gonna be a battle here

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.560
the rich are winning, the rich are winning really

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.840
really really aggressively.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.840
For a long time

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.120
the middle class have been relatively protected.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.640
That's gonna change now

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.400
the middle class are gonna start to get hit

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.840
because you're the only guys left that have any wealth

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.560
in a situation where the rich need to take more

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.160
and more and more and more and more

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.760
What are you gonna do?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.360
What are the middle class gonna do?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.840
Are they gonna stand with the poor,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.240
with the working class, who have already been impoverished

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.800
to protect themselves from the rich

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.360
who are taking everybody's assets

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.400
or are they gonna allow themselves to be divided

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.160
in which case the rich will take everything

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.040
including the houses your kids need.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.400
Listen, we're gonna fight against it

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.600
we're gonna try to protect the ordinary

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.480
working people from the super rich.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.680
Protect your wealth, protect your kids

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.520
protect your families, protect your future

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.160
