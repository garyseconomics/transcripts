00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
you know I literally went into Oxford and&nbsp;said 
listen the economy is collapsing I know&nbsp;why&nbsp;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.280
I've made millions of pounds doing it&nbsp;
I was one of the best economists in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.320
best traders in the whole world, one of&nbsp;
the biggest banks in the whole world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.960
I don't want it to happen, can we stop it?&nbsp;
and they were completely not interested

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.960
okay I wanted to do a video called&nbsp;
the World of Economics which basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.680
explains to you exactly what economics is, the&nbsp;
different spaces, the different people in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.040
of economics, how it takes shape, um I wanted&nbsp;
to understand, I wanted to explain it because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.000
basically this affects policy, affects government,&nbsp;
it affects the way the economy is managed, &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.280
it massively affects your life, especially with&nbsp;regards 
to things like; the economic management&nbsp;or

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.440
mismanagement of Covid &amp; 2008 (GFC) &amp; yet I think&nbsp;
ordinary people generally don't have good awareness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.200
of how that world works why the different&nbsp;
people are in the different spaces and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.960
who you see and who you don't see and what's&nbsp;
happening on your TV and what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.000
behind the screen so today we're going to explain&nbsp;
the world of economics. I'm going to take you back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.920
to university because this is basically where the&nbsp;
World of Economics begins and where most economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
professionals and most economic students start&nbsp;
their life right, so I studied at London School&nbsp;of&nbsp;

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.120
Economics (LSE) and most powerful economists and&nbsp;
people who end up in powerful roles in government,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.640
in central banking, in media, in finance will&nbsp;go 
to one of these 'elite economics institutions'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.920
so in this country the UK we have quite a lot&nbsp;
of elite universities we've got the London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.080
School of Economics, we've got Oxford, we've&nbsp;
got Cambridge, we've got other universities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.920
like Warwick and Imperial and Durham and UCL 
a lot&nbsp;of prestigious universities which will produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.920
professional economists who can go and&nbsp;
work in professional economic spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.200
um there are a lot of very powerful universities&nbsp;
in the US such as Harvard and Yale and Princeton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.120
and MIT and Chicago is quite influential&nbsp;in
economics and there's there's one big one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.440
called Bacconi in Italy and another big one in&nbsp;
Paris and the point I want to get through to&nbsp;you&nbsp;

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.720
here is most powerful economists come through&nbsp;
a pretty small number of elite universities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.760
they tend to come from richer families&nbsp;
because economics itself is the least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.040
economically diverse subject of any in a major&nbsp;
university which means that economic students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.400
tend to come from richer families, there's&nbsp;
very few that tend to come from poor families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.400
now say you get into one of these top universities,&nbsp;
when you're actually in the university I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.240
it's interesting I think most people&nbsp;
will be interested to understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.920
the vast majority of what you do on an&nbsp;
economics degree is basically memorising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.800
and regurgitating Algebra, I think people would be&nbsp;
really surprised to know that we don't talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.760
why housing has become unaffordable or why&nbsp;
increasingly it's difficult to get well-paid jobs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.760
or difficult to securely have a family, these are&nbsp;
things which in elite universities you know&nbsp;and&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.080
I studied 3 years at London School of Economics&nbsp;
&amp; more recently did a 2 year Masters at Oxford,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.160
at elite universities we don't discuss things like&nbsp;
the cost of living crisis or house price crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.240
or increased poverty; these things are, if you're&nbsp;
lucky you might be able to take them in the sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.680
of optional module which nobody who's serious&nbsp;
about becoming an economist would take, what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.800
generally do is algebra, algebra, algebra, lots and&nbsp;
lots of algebra and um economists tend to be very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.240
good at algebra because that's what they've done&nbsp;
they memorize a lot of algebra for complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.320
models and they repeat the algebra in the exam&nbsp;
that's basically the training of an economies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.400
the next important step in the World of&nbsp;
Economics is what happens when you finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.840
your undergrad degree, now at this&nbsp;
point the World of Economics which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.760
up until your 21-22, has lived in the&nbsp;
universities, it starts to split in essence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.920
a huge number of economics graduates from these&nbsp;
top universities go into Finance and these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
who go into Finance you will never hear them, you&nbsp;
never see them, they're not going to be on your TV,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920
very few of them will never work for&nbsp;
government, for civil service, for the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.080
these guys can make a lot of money they can make a&nbsp;
million pounds a year, two million pounds a year if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.400
they're very successful they can make Â£10 million&nbsp;
a year these guys can make a lot of money but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.640
you will never hear them, these guys they disappear 
from&nbsp;the public world once they go into Finance

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.240
other people go into public facing jobs and&nbsp;
these are the economists that you see so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.360
these are the economists that might write&nbsp;
for the guardian or might work in media or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.800
might work for the central bank and become&nbsp;
chief economist of the central bank or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.400
head of central bank monetary policy committee or&nbsp;
they might end up going into academia and becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.560
prestigious academic economists, basically at this&nbsp;
point, normally the end of the undergrad sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.960
the end of the post grad, there's a split in&nbsp;
economists between those that basically go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.440
out into finance to try to make money and those&nbsp;
that stay in some public facing role; academia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.840
think tanks is another place that people can go 
but&nbsp;there's a split at this point; those who go in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.880
to the money world &amp; those who go into the public&nbsp;
facing world and it's important to understand

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.160
there's an enormous difference&nbsp;
in expected financial outcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.640
in this world right so if you stay, if you&nbsp;
want to become a public-facing economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.280
you are probably gonna have to do a master's&nbsp;degree, 
you might well have to do a PhD, so you're going&nbsp;to be&nbsp;

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.680
staying at University for at least another&nbsp;
four years it could be five six seven years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.040
um and you will be probably paying to study&nbsp;
if you're lucky you might get a scholarship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.480
which means that you you know basically&nbsp;
enough to sort of live off but you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.160
probably going to have five six seven years&nbsp;
of of of poverty at least in terms of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.800
income from your work or you might even be paying&nbsp;
to work whereas if you go into finance you know I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.520
was literally a multi-millionaire at 25. so&nbsp;
there's a massive massive difference in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.440
expected financial outcomes of depending on which&nbsp;
direction that you go in um and for this reason

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.800
for most people going into finance is a much more&nbsp;
attractive option because it's just unbelievably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.480
better paid than going into public facing&nbsp;
economics, which sort of raises a question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:44.280
of who goes into public facing economics?&nbsp;
um and I think you either have to be rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.800
or a bit crazy really because you know I come&nbsp;
from a poor background right and um I made a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.560
of money in the city and that is the money which&nbsp;
I used to fund this Channel and that is the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.920
which I used to buy the place that I live in and&nbsp;
then my brother needed to buy a place I helped him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.440
buy a place and now my sister needs to buy a place&nbsp;
I'm helping her buy a place so basically this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.600
the money which provides complete financial&nbsp;
security for me, my family, my kids if I ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.000
have kids um and if I had gone into Academia, I&nbsp;
wouldn't have a property, my brother wouldn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.400
a property, my sister wouldn't have a property and&nbsp;
probably I would never be able to comfortably have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.880
a family so that it's a massive massive financial&nbsp;
sacrifice you make to go into public facing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.520
economics and whilst there are some people who&nbsp;
believe in it so much they will do that the vast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.120
majority of people who are able to do that are&nbsp;
people who are from richer backgrounds because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.320
they can afford to take that financial hit, their&nbsp;
parents can support them throughout their studies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.760
um it's important to realise even after you&nbsp;
graduate in that public sector space you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.400
probably not going to make a lot of money for&nbsp;
the first few years of your career working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.600
as an economist in the media, in academia, in in the&nbsp;
world of think tanks, the world of government, civil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.320
service, so that's the first thing to understand is&nbsp;
that we there's basically 2 worlds of economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.120
a world that is very well paid which you never&nbsp;
see and a world which is pretty badly paid but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:20.320
you do see and these guys are the guys whose job&nbsp;
is to protect you basically the guys who and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.880
kind of need to ask yourself okay well what&nbsp;
kind of people are you probably gonna get and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.040
of course you know there are good people who&nbsp;
go into academia, who can go into think tanks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.840
go into civil service, go into government and&nbsp;
I know a lot of them so it's still possible that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.280
we get good people in this in this world of&nbsp;
of public facing economics but then I think

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.480
then we need to start talking about the&nbsp;
second question which is the differences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.800
in incentivization and motivation structures for&nbsp;
the people in the two different worlds right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.920
the best paid 10,000 economists in the world&nbsp;
are probably all traders, that's the first thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.720
that you probably should know right I think that's&nbsp;
quite interesting right because you probably don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.600
know personally any traders you know there are&nbsp;
a couple who have a public profile like it's me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.400
and there's like a couple others I don't remember&nbsp;
their names but um the vast majority of traders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.160
you'll never hear from, so the economists that&nbsp;you 
see for example is it Evan Davis the guy on&nbsp;BBC

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:25.240
you know Andy Verity I'm not sure but whatever
the guys you know Larry Elliott at the guardian or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:32.440
Huw Pill chief economists of the Bank of&nbsp;England 
or um Andrew Bailey head of the Bank of&nbsp;England&nbsp;

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.920
or Janet Yelen who used to be head of the Fed,&nbsp;
all of these people, these economists have all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.720
are basically do not have, are not the best paid&nbsp;
economists, so what I think it's quite interesting is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.880
a little bit like when we watch the news, when&nbsp;
we interact with the public facing economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.400
we think we're looking at the best economists&nbsp;
but it's a little bit like we're watching like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.160
division 3 football (I love division 3&nbsp;football 
because Leyton Orient just won the league) but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.120
and we think we're watching the Premier League&nbsp;
but in reality the Premier League is happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.360
in some skyscraper that you never see so&nbsp;
I think the first thing is to realise that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.760
all of the best paid economists are not in the&nbsp;
public's sphere right and those guys, the traders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.640
they are very very, well I think maybe that's&nbsp;
changed a little bit since I was there but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.480
in general when they're very well incentivised&nbsp;
to make predictions that are right, it's a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.800
it's not an immoral world, it's more of an 
amoral world right, your job is just to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.520
just be right, just be right, you know so when&nbsp;i was 
there, are things gonna be good or are things

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.040
gonna be bad? 'I think things are gonna be bad' 
oh you're&nbsp;right, here's your money &amp; it's also very&nbsp;

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.240
there's a very transparent analysis structure, so people&nbsp;
can see who's the best economist at Citibank so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.840
when I was a Citibanks top economist, you know&nbsp;
there was a spreadsheet that went out to all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.560
traders on the floor and they could see oh 
this&nbsp;year, Gary's the best Citibank trader&nbsp;or&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.640
economist, in terms of his predictions were the&nbsp;
best predictions right so very a-moral and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.120
immoral but just, very objective very transparent&nbsp;
in incentive structure, for those traders, try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.440
be right, try and be right, try and be right,&nbsp;
everybody can see who's right &amp; who's wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.600
now let's consider the traders in the public&nbsp;sphere, 
the sorry the economists in the public sphere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.920
see i'm always reminded of this one professor&nbsp;i had 
at Oxford who wrote a paper and then he lectured

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:28.920
us on the paper saying that if the Eurozone&nbsp;
had not done quantitative easing then their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:35.320
GDP would have been something like 3.7% lower he&nbsp;
made a really specific prediction about how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.720
lower GDP would be if they hadn't done&nbsp;that 
and that was interesting for me because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.280
it's very rare that economists make very clear&nbsp;
specific predictions (economists in academia)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.280
so what because in my experience economists in&nbsp;
academia very rarely just try and think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.280
try and like really specifically be right about&nbsp;
something so I put my hand up because I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:07.480
interested and I said to him "do you think that's&nbsp;
right?" and he said to me "what do you mean?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.720
and i was like, you know, would you, you know
"did you write this paper?" he was like "yes" and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.600
I was like "you know do you think that's right?" &amp;&nbsp;
he said to me "I don't, I don't know what you mean!"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.280
I said "do you think its right, that if the ECB&nbsp;didn't do 
QE, then Eurozone GP would be 3.7% lower?" and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.440
he just said "I just I don't know what you mean!" and&nbsp;
i thought that was so interesting but super telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.160
about what most (there are of course some good&nbsp;
people in academia) what most academic economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.000
are doing in their career which is, what they get&nbsp;
rewarded for, what they get paid for, what they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.160
promoted for; is writing very mathematically&nbsp;
flamboyant mathematically elegant papers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.680
they don't have time to think about what actually 
would&nbsp;have happened, what's going to happen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.400
what's really happening because that's not what they 
get&nbsp;paid to do, that's not what they get incentivised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.200
to do, that's not what they get rewarded to do and&nbsp;
if you were to actually do that as an economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.520
it would seriously jeopardize your career because&nbsp;
it's being an academic economist is not easy it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.840
not easy and I think I want to link this back to&nbsp;
what it's like being an economic student which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.320
economic students I've mentioned they spend all&nbsp;
their time doing algebra and you might be thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.480
well why don't the economic students argue against&nbsp;
that? why don't they criticise? well but the fact is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.240
being an economic student at an elite&nbsp;
University is ****ing hard, like they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.440
a lot of algebra to memorise, seriously&nbsp;
a lot and when you go to these exams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.040
if you haven't memorised the algebra, 
you're&nbsp;going to fail the exam right so these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.080
guys are busy and they're working damn hard&nbsp;
to memorise the algebra they don't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.800
have time to question what's happening if they&nbsp;
want to get a good degree and to get a good job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.000
and it's the same for the professors being&nbsp;
an economics professor is not easy, you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.480
to write really complicated papers and if you&nbsp;
don't write those papers you're not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.920
get promoted, we've already discussed that it's&nbsp;
not a very lucrative job it's very competitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.920
it's a struggle to make ends meet unless you're&nbsp;
from a rich background right so these professors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:12.240
they are not paid to try and understand stuff and&nbsp;
I think that the traders who are paid to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.720
it's very difficult to be right about the real&nbsp;
world without some understanding but to write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.000
a very elegant mathematical paper that is you&nbsp;
don't really need to know anything about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.800
real economy so these academics primarily&nbsp;
are just trying to write fancy papers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.800
now that brings us to the next world of&nbsp;
public economics which is the media now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.560
I've been floating around the economics media&nbsp;
now for a couple of years and um I'm not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:44.680
name any names but it is one of the most comedic&nbsp;
spaces I have existed in my entire life and I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.280
guarantee you with absolute certainty that the&nbsp;
vast majority of people in the economics media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:55.200
have never even asked themselves the question&nbsp;
of "should I try and be right?" their job is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.520
write professional looking articles and to&nbsp;
produce professional looking media content&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.760
especially if you're considering the news and&nbsp;
the radio these guys run 24 7 content right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.600
they need people to come on, and they don't&nbsp;
know who the best people are, they're calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.080
around, they call me up "hey can you 
come&nbsp;and talk about this" and I'll be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.840
"I don't really know about that" &amp; they'll&nbsp;be 
like "yeah it'll be fine" you know these&nbsp;guys&nbsp;

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.520
they just want to produce professional&nbsp;looking 
media content, and I don't think there is

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.160
any more comedic space within economics and&nbsp;
economics media and that is again because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.680
nobody, if you write an article, you know I've&nbsp;
mentioned it many times, I predicted at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.240
beginning of Covid we would have a 
cost of living crisis at the end of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.600
nobody goes back and checks right you know
if&nbsp;somebody's written that in the guardian you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.080
know, well I did write in the guardian, nobody&nbsp;
goes oh let's get that guy back who was right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.560
3 years ago right, you know nobody goes back,&nbsp;
media is the classic example of economics where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.600
nobody checks their homework but what you&nbsp;
are judged on is a looking professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.560
sounding professional, and economists&nbsp;
in general, will act according to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.080
incentives, so economics and academia are trying&nbsp;
to write fancy papers, economics in the media are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.640
trying to present professional looking content&nbsp;
but none of them really care about being right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.480
economics in the central bank well I mean in the&nbsp;
central bank I think they they are slightly more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.720
tied to reality but as you can see the central&nbsp;
bank has done a phenomenally poor job of managing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.280
inflation in the last few years and they've done a&nbsp;
phenomenally poor job of managing the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.800
in the last 20 years, you know does anybody&nbsp;get 
fired? does anybody get fined? you know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.200
I would like to talk to more people in Central&nbsp;
Banking because I think here is a space where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.600
people could be more open-minded but I think&nbsp;
the problem you have is the vast majority of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.800
senior economists at central banks are basically&nbsp;
academics and they've been steeped in this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:52.920
of just learn and repeat, just memorise and I&nbsp;
think again you have a problem of basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.680
there is not seriously any reward for&nbsp;
being right and I think the end result is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.680
in the whole of, oh of course we should mention the&nbsp;
last World of Economics which is government and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.960
um you know I'm not going to mention any 
names&nbsp;but I talk to politicians and I tell them&nbsp;

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.880
"if you don't fix inequality, the economy will&nbsp;
collapse and living standards will collapse"&nbsp;

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.760
and they turn around and they say to me&nbsp;
"yeah but we don't think it's a vote winner"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.600
&amp; that tells you the incentivisations of&nbsp;government 
right these guys need to win elections and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.080
and most of what they spend their time&nbsp;doing 
is thinking "how do we win elections?" so i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.640
what you have in the World of Economics is quite&nbsp;
interesting right you have one group of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.320
who you will never see who get paid a ton of money&nbsp;
specifically to be right and people who are right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.440
get aggressively promoted and aggressively&nbsp;
rewarded and people are wrong get fired and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.320
they are in no way given any responsibility to&nbsp;
manage your economy and then in the world of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.640
public economics you have a load of people who&nbsp;
are doing like weird different kinds of dances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.720
essentially you have academics, who are trying to&nbsp;
write fancy papers, media people who are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.880
produce professional looking media, government&nbsp;
people who are trying to win elections and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.880
know people who think tanks who are generally&nbsp;
just trying to push whatever political view&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.240
they want, but nobody is rewarded for being right&nbsp;
so nobody is trying to be right, I think the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:28.200
result is what you've what you have is really the&nbsp;
kind of the complete intellectual death of public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.840
economics as a result of these two things which is&nbsp;
number one aggressively sucking or aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.840
incentivising through money all of the best people&nbsp;
to not work in the public sector and then creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.160
incentive structure in the public sector such&nbsp;
that you are heavily incentivised not to actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.520
try to be right and that brings us to the next&nbsp;
thing which is how can we fix this okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.520
in a sense what you have with this division is&nbsp;
a natural manifestation of wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:06.280
in society which is the very rich can pay
people like me a lot of money to work for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.640
whereas governments are increasingly bankrupt&nbsp;
media doesn't really care about how good you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:20.080
and only cares about what you look like so&nbsp;
this public sphere is never going to pay enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.160
to compete with finance but there are still&nbsp;
people within economics who care enough about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.520
preventing the collapse of our society that they&nbsp;
would work for government in the public sector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.320
even for no money you know I would be willing&nbsp;
to support government in preventing economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.840
collapse even for free I do this YouTube channel&nbsp;
for free because I don't want society to collapse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:52.560
but because we have no structures of identifying&nbsp;
and rewarding good people in public economics it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:02.040
becomes impossible for people like me to actually&nbsp;
get senior jobs in public economics and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.400
it's so interesting that I could go and walk in&nbsp;
the skyscraper and get paid two million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.560
a year to bet on the collapse of our society but&nbsp;
if I went to try to speak to you know I literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.440
went into Oxford and said listen the economy&nbsp;
is collapsing I know why I've been millions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.680
pounds doing it I was one of the best economists&nbsp;
in best traders in the whole world one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.720
biggest banks in the whole world I don't want it&nbsp;
to happen can we stop it and they were completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.720
not interested and you know I've been out here you&nbsp;
know I know people in government must have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:39.240
these videos saying let's stop the... but they're&nbsp;
not interested, I think what we need to do is we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.520
need to start checking the homework of economists&nbsp;
in the public sector we need to start saying okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.240
make predictions and let's find out who is able&nbsp;
to correctly predict what is happening because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.200
economics is not a physical science we can't do&nbsp;
experiments so it becomes very difficult to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.040
with certainty who was right and who was wrong&nbsp;
because we can't go back so for example I said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.320
at the beginning of Covid we are going to see a&nbsp;
massive cost of living crisis at the end of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.400
and that happened but now people turn around and&nbsp;
say oh but you just got lucky because it happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400
it was because of the war in Ukraine and that's&nbsp;
the reason why it happened then you actually got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.920
lucky right um and you know my history is you know&nbsp;
I've been lucky for a ****ing long time right you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.840
know I've retired at age 26 because I have a very&nbsp;
long track record of making correct predictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.720
right but in the public sector and in finance that&nbsp;
is enough to you know put Gary in the front line let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.280
him manage the money let him make the decisions&nbsp;
because he has a track record of being right but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:44.680
in the public sector there is no way essentially&nbsp;
for somebody like me who has a long track record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:50.080
of being right to criticize or challenge the&nbsp;
people in power even if they have a long track&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.960
record of being wrong and if that's what you&nbsp;
create as your system of managing the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.120
is inevitable that your economy&nbsp;
will collapse basically because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.000
you will end up with with idiots running&nbsp;
the economy and there will be no way for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.040
even well-meaning people who are willing to do&nbsp;
it for free and who understand to challenge them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.600
so I think we need to start forcing&nbsp;
public sector economies to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.960
predictions of the future, I think that if we do&nbsp;
this this will happen, if we do that that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:26.200
happen, so that we can start taking the microphone&nbsp;
away from these posh boys who are always wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.240
and giving a bit of power to people who actually&nbsp;
understand what's happening because otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.760
of course they're all going to go work in the&nbsp;
skyscrapers for two million pounds a year why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.800
are you going to work for government if they're&nbsp;
not even going to listen to you if you're right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:46.120
that is to conclude the world of Economics it&nbsp;
is honestly it's an absolutely comedic situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.680
it's an absolutely comedic situation with all of&nbsp;
the best guys locked away in the skyscraper and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.360
you know I've worked I've been at two of the top&nbsp;
universities in the world for economics I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.040
on the trading floor I've worked in the media I've&nbsp;
been in think tanks the quantity of discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.920
on the trading floor is I don't want to give the&nbsp;
impressionable Traders as Union since they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.920
but the quality of discussion trading for is so&nbsp;
much better because people are trying to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:15.240
and at the moment all of the people who are taking&nbsp;
your tax money to run the economy are not trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.040
to be right &amp; um that is why they keep&nbsp;getting 
it wrong so we need to fix it we&nbsp;need to

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.480
hold economists to account we need to have&nbsp;
actually intelligent people running the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.520
and i know we don't so um let's change&nbsp;
it share this video around let people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.440
know the system is broken but it can be&nbsp;
fixed if we just put good people in charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.040
let's change it thank you! 
*a&nbsp;couple of questions if you dont mind*

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.840
*um so you used to mention about checking their&nbsp;
homework, yeah is it really like no one who's work*&nbsp;

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.880
*you check and they at least get a a little bit&nbsp;
right or* I think there's a silver there's a super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.960
when I challenge economists about you guys have&nbsp;
are always wrong consistently consistently wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:06.760
what they say to me is oh but it's impossible to&nbsp;
be right it's and it's how funny is that some posh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:12.120
boy who's basically barely left his mother's womb&nbsp;
right just been like silver spoon fed through his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.720
whole career being wrong his whole career talking&nbsp;
to me right ****ing expelled from school ****ing

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.520
multi-millionaire at 25 because he keeps being&nbsp;
right predicting the economic economic crisis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.000
he just turns around and says the reason we're&nbsp;
always wrong is because it's impossible to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.320
and there's there's this kind of there's this&nbsp;
self-protecting like nihilism that has like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.640
dripped into their consciousness which is yeah we&nbsp;
know we're always wrong but we're still the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.920
and you know it's a little bit like you go&nbsp;
to watch your local pub team and they're all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.520
like yeah we lose every game but we're the&nbsp;
best because it's impossible to win games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.920
you know it's impossible and every day the&nbsp;
traders are getting like way right yeah but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.800
you know that's what that was what will happen if&nbsp;
you you know if you bankrupt your public sphere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.760
and you pay all of the best people to work for the&nbsp;
rich you know you know imagine imagine building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:09.040
a football team with no funding and expecting to&nbsp;
beat ****ing man city and then when you continually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.400
lose say it's impossible to be good at football&nbsp;
thats what all these economies say and its such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.080
a comedy, it's a comical farce what is happening&nbsp;
in the world of Economics, um but you see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.440
consequences it's ****ing horrible you know what&nbsp;
I mean and it's it's yeah it's it's truly amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:31.200
I think what we're witnessing is so amazing&nbsp;
so amazing and it's uh this like complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.000
it's like a complicated mixture&nbsp;
of corruption greed and idiocy
