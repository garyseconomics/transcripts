00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.860
Welcome back to Garys Economics&nbsp;
today we are going to explain&nbsp;

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.040
how wealth inequality affects the economy

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.520
okay so this is going to be one of the key&nbsp;
educational videos of the Youtube&nbsp;um

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.660
First you're gonna need to understand what wealth&nbsp;is
um so if you haven't seen it I would recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
watching the "what is wealth" video but I'll give a&nbsp;
brief explanation here when we talk about wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.080
we're not talking about jobs or incomes we're&nbsp;
talking about who owns the physical resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.140
um of our country and of our economy so: who&nbsp;
owns the buildings, who owns the houses, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
owns the land, who owns the natural resources, &nbsp;
who owns the debt that is a big form of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.980
um that's we're talking about um and before I&nbsp;
start if anyone prefers like a text version of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
these kinds of things explained it's all on my&nbsp;website www.wealtheconomics.org on the section called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.220
'the wealth unequal economy' Ok so to understand&nbsp;
how wealth inequality affects the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.300
first we need to understand what wealth inequality&nbsp;
looks like and to explain that I'm going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.880
over what a more wealth equal economy would look&nbsp;
like and compare that to what our wealth unequal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
economy would look like so when we talk about&nbsp;
wealth inequality we're talking about who owns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.520
the assets so in a wealth equal economy and I'm&nbsp;
not talking about necessarily perfect equality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.460
um but in a broadly equal economy what that&nbsp;
would mean is most people would have some decent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.400
ownership of assets so most people would for&nbsp;
example own their own home and they would also own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.780
some share of the the productive economy so they&nbsp;
might own some part of a factory or a business or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.280
of some farmland or some energy production&nbsp;
resources there's the homes there's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
commercial buildings and there's also productive&nbsp;
resources and it was the equal economy most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.000
would own some parts of all of those things um&nbsp;
that would mean most people wouldn't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.340
worry about paying rent or very large mortgage and&nbsp;
also people would be getting some passive income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.520
from the ownership of the commercial economy&nbsp;
that they own um in that economy most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520
would be quite secure because they're own their&nbsp;
own property and they also have passive income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.680
um and they would have some extra money to spend&nbsp;
now in a world of unequal economy what you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.560
is a world in which the vast majority of the&nbsp;
physical resources are owned by a very small group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.680
of extremely wealthy people um on top of that 
in&nbsp;a very wealth unequal economy the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.820
people would also be in debt to the very wealthy&nbsp;
people um when I say this some people might assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.920
because I'm very opposed to inequality that&nbsp;
I'm suggesting the UK is a very unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.260
um actually on this sliding scale of this the&nbsp;
UK is not a particularly unequal economy if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.840
compare to most countries in the world and to&nbsp;
history; a lot of countries in the world do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.000
have many landowners many property owners 
ordinary&nbsp;people don't own property so most countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.800
are very unequal and in the past the UK has been&nbsp;
very unequal at the moment the UK does have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.680
relatively large property owning middle class&nbsp;
so the UK at the moment is somewhere in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.260
middle but it's moving towards the wealth unequal&nbsp;
side okay so these are the two examples what an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540
economy can look like a wealth equal economy&nbsp;
where everybody owns some stuff some assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.840
their own property and get some passive income&nbsp;
from what they own a whilst unequal economy where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.340
most people own very little or nothing and&nbsp;
a tiny group of people own enormous amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.080
so what does the wealth of an equal economy do?&nbsp;
how does it affect ordinary people? well the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.160
obvious thing is that in a wealth and equal&nbsp;
economy most people don't own their own home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
if they do it will be with a large mortgage&nbsp;
they also don't own any share in the natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.500
resources which um includes the food production&nbsp;
industry the energy production industry like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.040
essential things to live like this um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.660
in a very wealth unequal economy a lot of people&nbsp;
are quite insecure because they don't own the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.860
assets which produce the things essential&nbsp;
for life like housing like food like energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.220
which means they have to work um so in a wealth&nbsp;
unequal economy most people you know really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.300
desperately need to work pretty much all the time&nbsp;
otherwise they literally can't live in a home they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.420
can't eat and again the UK is not at this extreme&nbsp;
level yet although it's going that direction um

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.600
on the flip side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.460
in a wealth unequal economy the rich people are&nbsp;
extraordinarily rich; very very very very rich um

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.120
at this point it's important to understand&nbsp;
another thing that I've been trying to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.100
on the channel I mentioned a few times which is&nbsp;
that rich people spend a much lower percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.860
their income than ordinary people this is just a&nbsp;
natural consequence of the fact that the income is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.020
so high so if you consider Rishi Sunak he probably&nbsp;
makes an income from his wealth of about 30 or 40&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.060
million pounds a year if you imagine yourself if&nbsp;
you had a passive income of 30-40 million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.200
a year you probably wouldn't spend all of it you'd&nbsp;
spend you know even if you spent half of it you'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.520
be living an unbelievably luxurious life and you&nbsp;
probably use the rest to save up so rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.900
have this huge income but they tend to save most&nbsp;
of their income so because we know that ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.500
people spend their income and rich people save&nbsp;
their income in a very unequal economy all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.540
that income your rent your mortgage the profits&nbsp;
of Corporations goes to this small amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.160
rich people who tend not to spend very much so&nbsp;
what that means is we know in an unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.700
demand for consumption is low overall consumption&nbsp;
will be quite low because all of the income is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.260
going to people who don't spend much money and&nbsp;
this immediately creates a problem right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.400
on the one hand we have a huge group of people&nbsp;
who desperately need to work in order to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.020
and on the other hand you have a small group&nbsp;
of people who own the essentials that you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.520
to live and they don't want to spend very much&nbsp;
money so straight away you can see that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.000
a bit of a imbalance here basically lots of&nbsp;
people desperately need work because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.020
don't own homes or food the people who own&nbsp;
the homes and the food don't really want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.840
spend much money so you immediately end up&nbsp;
in a situation in an unequal economy where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.640
wages are quite low and that is because you&nbsp;
have a lot of desperate workers and a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.640
small amount of rich people who don't want&nbsp;
to spend this is compounded by the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:47.160
in a modern economy a lot of the wealth which rich&nbsp;
people own is technology um especially nowadays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.180
rich people own very high tech factories that&nbsp;
are able to produce an enormous amount of goods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:01.920
with very few workers if you look at for example&nbsp;
farming farming used to require a huge amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.940
workers to produce a lot of food whereas now in&nbsp;
this country almost no workers are in farming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:13.320
and yet still a huge amount of food is produced um&nbsp;
so what that means is today these wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.600
who own huge amounts of assets including your&nbsp;
home your mortgage the food production energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.380
production um they also have a huge amount of very&nbsp;
high technology which means they don't need many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.020
workers so in a big picture what you have here&nbsp;
in unequal economy is a huge amount of workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.140
who are desperate to work otherwise they will&nbsp;
literally starve and a tiny number of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.400
who don't want to spend much money and don't need&nbsp;
any workers because they've got machines anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.820
so I think this is the first key point if you&nbsp;
understand this broad structure of an of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.660
unequal economy it is quite inevitable that&nbsp;
unequal economies will have very low wages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.300
um and that is exactly for the reason which I've&nbsp;
just explained to you unequate economies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.820
large numbers of desperate workers small numbers&nbsp;
of people who can spend who have who spend a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.960
low proportion of their income and have very&nbsp;
advanced technology such that they don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.440
a workers so that's the first thing in a very&nbsp;
unequal economy wages are low because there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.720
lot of disparate workers and a very small number&nbsp;
of people who are not spending a lot of money um

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.460
but if the rich are not spending&nbsp;
money what are they doing with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.400
well what rich people like to do is save&nbsp;
very large amounts of their income and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.100
leads to the next big consequence of um wealth&nbsp;
inequality and we touched this a little bit in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.520
economics video some people think that if the&nbsp;
rich have a lot of money and they save it that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.980
great because it will lead to Investments&nbsp;
and a growing economy but we also know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.180
in the world and equal economy there's very low&nbsp;
levels of overall spending demand for spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.840
so in that environment it is quite&nbsp;
unlikely that businesses will try to expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.060
um you know since 2008 as the economy has&nbsp;
become more and more unequal we've actually seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.580
record increase in wealth of the richest and&nbsp;
also extremely low rates of investment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.300
in my opinion this is and you can ask businesses&nbsp;
this is largely because the consumer is quite weak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.300
people are not spending much money if people&nbsp;
are not spending money business don't expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.160
so what do rich people do&nbsp;
with the money that they save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.360
if they're not investing in growing new&nbsp;
businesses growing the economy building new assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.840
um well what they can do is&nbsp;
they can buy the existing assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:42.120
and if rich people are phenomenally Rich then we&nbsp;
know that they have huge income and if they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.200
using that income to buy assets this will push&nbsp;
asset prices up so this is in in essence the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.900
mirror of wages being low in an unequal economy a&nbsp;
big amount of the income goes to the rich they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.860
not spending it so wages are low they are saving&nbsp;
it so asset prices are higher um so that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:08.040
second big fact about non-equal economy is that&nbsp;
asset prices are high and probably most noticeably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.700
and most problematically for Ordinary People&nbsp;
ordinary families that includes house prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.880
um and that is quite simply because in a in an&nbsp;
unequal economy the rich get huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.180
they use it to buy assets all assets go up not&nbsp;
just houses but including houses um leading to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.300
the second major fact of unequal economies in&nbsp;
unequal economies house prices are very high um

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.000
and these first two major facts of an unequal&nbsp;
economy which is number one wages are low and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.380
number two assets including house prices&nbsp;
are higher they obviously interact in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:50.100
very troubling way right because if your wage is&nbsp;
low and at the same time house prices are high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:57.600
then as the economy becomes more and more unequal&nbsp;
you inevitably move into a situation where buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.980
property becomes increasingly impossible for&nbsp;
people from poor families regardless of what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.140
do for a job or in their education I think we're&nbsp;
starting to see that a lot more visibly here in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.300
the UK but it's also I think become more visible&nbsp;
in Europe in the US in Japan in a lot of countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.260
in Australia um and an obvious consequence of&nbsp;
that is that social Mobility becomes very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.240
low because if you can't buy a house even if&nbsp;
you get a good job then it becomes extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.820
difficult to move from being a poor family&nbsp;
to being a comfortable family and number two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.460
Financial Security becomes increasingly impossible&nbsp;
to attain for ordinary families um and I think I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.360
probably don't think I need to labor this that&nbsp;
much because it's becoming increasingly really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.700
really visible to a lot of families and people&nbsp;
especially young people around the world that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.040
wages are low especially compared to house&nbsp;
prices and that means that even if you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.300
work pretty hard and get a great job it becomes&nbsp;
increasingly very difficult to own property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.440
and then that makes it difficult to comfortably&nbsp;
financially own a family or even safer retirement

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.620
okay so those are our three main features of an&nbsp;
unequal economy so far number one low wages number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:18.480
two high asset price including house prices number&nbsp;
three low levels of social Mobility number four uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:25.860
low levels of Financial Security for most people&nbsp;
um another couple of features that I think are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:34.440
interesting of a wealth and equal economy is um&nbsp;
concentration of what happens in the economy so

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.720
in an equal economy we all have some income&nbsp;
and we will have some extra money to spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.900
and then that means the economy tends to produce&nbsp;
things that Ordinary People want because ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.500
people are driving the economy ordinary people&nbsp;
have money to spend have money in their pockets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:01.560
um but in a very unequal economy wages are low&nbsp;
house prices are high so Ordinary People don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.880
have much money to spend but the rich have huge&nbsp;
amounts of money to spend and the more unequal the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:13.080
economy becomes the more money the rich have um&nbsp;
what that means is as an economy becomes more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.280
more unequal the spending of the rich becomes much&nbsp;
more powerful relative to the spending of the poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.040
and um you start to see that reflected in what&nbsp;
kind of Industries are successful in an economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.700
so in a relatively more equal economy&nbsp;
like we had in the 50s 60s 70s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.640
and into the 80s in this country um economies&nbsp;
were really driven by the spending of the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.380
class and by middle class I really mean like&nbsp;
average person in an average financial situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.900
and I might know it's a big boom in you know&nbsp;
producing cause for ordinary people or even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.640
close for ordinary people um whereas now as&nbsp;
the economy is coming more and more unequal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.500
the economy is Shifting towards the spending of&nbsp;
the very rich so we know that rich people save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.160
huge amounts of money so you're seeing growth&nbsp;
in asset management and investment Industries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:06.780
um but the spending that rich people do do even&nbsp;
though it's low as a percentage of their income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.180
tends to be on luxury so what you're seeing now I&nbsp;
think is really interesting we have this massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.440
cost of living crisis and people are struggling&nbsp;
to eat and to eat their homes but I live in London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.640
and I went to the center of London the other&nbsp;
day Soho and it's popping you know the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.440
rich people are spending money in inexpensive&nbsp;
restaurants because they've got a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.280
um and obviously what that means is um you&nbsp;
know ordinary restaurants will close down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.560
because their customers ordinary people&nbsp;
have no money and they'll be replaced by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.120
luxury restaurants because the rich have lots&nbsp;
of money so the next fact in an unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.440
the economy tends to focus on the industries&nbsp;
which which people enjoy such as luxury Industries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.220
and that leads me to my next point&nbsp;
which is geographic concentration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:59.880
so in an equal economy we are all workers but&nbsp;
we are all also Spenders and what that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:08.640
is wherever there are people there are Spenders&nbsp;
which means that in any town or Village or city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.280
you you can have a functioning economy where we&nbsp;
all work with one another because we all have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.980
job and we all have an income and we can we can&nbsp;
work one another you know the plumber can fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.720
my sync and I can do his well I could teach his&nbsp;
kids economics I suppose he can watch my videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.100
um but you know different people do&nbsp;
different jobs for for one another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.700
um but when you have a very unequal economy&nbsp;
the group of people who are Spenders and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.680
group of people who are workers becomes totally&nbsp;
different so rich people don't work because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.580
have huge passive income and Ordinary People&nbsp;
don't spend because they have very low wages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.060
what this means is in parts of the country where&nbsp;
there are not many rich people living there or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.300
going there the economy ceases to function because&nbsp;
you all need to pay your rent to the rich you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.660
need to you need to pay money to the rich to get&nbsp;
access to the things that you need which they own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:09.480
um but they don't live in your city so&nbsp;
and they don't come to your city so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.460
can't get the things that you need from them&nbsp;
and I think what we've seen massively over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.320
the last 20 30 years here in the UK but&nbsp;
also across European parts of the US is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:26.280
um parts of the country where rich people don't&nbsp;
live or don't go have basically ceased to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.700
economically viable it's become very difficult&nbsp;
to get jobs or well-paid jobs in those areas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.420
um sometimes people like to say that this is just&nbsp;
because of a growth of big cities but actually if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.300
you look in detail what we've seen is not us&nbsp;
not a growth in popularity of big cities but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.700
really a growth in popularity of anywhere where&nbsp;
rich people go so I live in Oxford for two years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:53.220
when I was doing my masters um Oxford is not a&nbsp;
big city it's a small City but Oxford is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:58.140
very expensive place to live I think it's possibly&nbsp;
the second most expensive place to live in the UK&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.260
Cambridge is also very expensive to live and&nbsp;
this is not because they're big cities but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.880
because these are places where rich people&nbsp;
send their kids to study um you know if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.520
look at ski villages in the Swiss Alps or popular&nbsp;
holiday resorts for the wealthy in in the United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.600
States these places have become really really&nbsp;
expensive despite the fact that they are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:26.280
um big cities so what people economists sometimes&nbsp;
think is a move towards big cities is actually in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.680
my opinion perfectly a manifestation of a very&nbsp;
unequal economy which is in an unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.480
you need to work for rich people because rich&nbsp;
people own the things that you need to live um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.160
if there are no rich people in your city or if you&nbsp;
are not spending money in your city then your city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:48.780
basically ceases to function economically and that&nbsp;
means that young people in in um you know lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:55.680
places with very you know proud histories such&nbsp;
as much of the north of this country um you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.700
huge sways of places like Spain and Italy um you&nbsp;
know places like the rust spot in the US um they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.740
basically cease to function economically because&nbsp;
the people who live there are a middle class that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:14.340
is disappearing they're losing assets that they're&nbsp;
rich um so essentially in a very unequal economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.860
you have to live with the rich people spend their&nbsp;
time and spend their money which leads to very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.960
high levels of geographic concentration so people&nbsp;
have to live wherever the rich people are near to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:31.260
them and we're definitely seeing that with um the&nbsp;
big growth in a difference between the big cities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.820
and the the popular fashionable places in Europe&nbsp;
and the US compared to the rest of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.780
um one knock-on consequence of that is that&nbsp;
you start to see increasing density of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.240
biggest cities um you know if you go and look at&nbsp;
really really unequal places in the world like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:55.680
like India or like Brazil we've seen this for a&nbsp;
long time which is ordinary people who don't own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.660
any natural resources have to flood to wherever&nbsp;
the rich people are and it leads to very dense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:08.580
um slums basically on the outskirts of cities um&nbsp;
and that this is inevitably what happens when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.120
have very high inequality which is which is poor&nbsp;
people who don't own any assets who need to go and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.940
live where the rich people are um and increasingly&nbsp;
we're seeing it in London you know I grew up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:25.620
in ilford um it was not very dense when I was a&nbsp;
kid and it was um family homes and now those homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.600
have all been expanded and they're packed full of&nbsp;
people um often not families often rented out by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.520
the room and that is because people both in this&nbsp;
country and all across Europe and all across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.740
world need to live where the rich people are&nbsp;
in a very unequal economy um and the knock-on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.400
consequence of that is obviously that you need to&nbsp;
live in places where the rents are higher because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.060
if you need to live in the same place where&nbsp;
the rich people live then you are competing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.900
with the rich people for space they have enormous&nbsp;
amount of income and they can drive the renter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.440
okay so I think that basically covers&nbsp;
it one more thing I wanted to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.260
was just explain the last most dangerous&nbsp;
thing about wealth inequality which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.580
um I've mentioned a few times before on the&nbsp;
channel which is that when World inequality is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:14.520
very high it means that ordinary people end up&nbsp;
paying pretty much all of their monthly annual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:21.780
wage to the rich in the forms of rent mortgage&nbsp;
food and bills which means that there is a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.380
cash flow from Ordinary People to the rich&nbsp;
every day every week every month every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.300
um again if you still like my favorite guy I&nbsp;
really hope it'll be prime minister one day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.460
um if we consider his 40 million income passive&nbsp;
income that he gets every year from you from your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.960
mortgage payments um he will use that to buy&nbsp;
the rest of the assets which means that next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.400
year wealth inequality will be worse which means&nbsp;
that next year the payments the cash flows from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.940
Ordinary People to the rich will be higher which&nbsp;
means that wealth and quality will get worse still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.580
so it has a very dangerous spiraling unstable&nbsp;
mechanism which is probably the key thing that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.020
saw back when I was a Trader and I realized wow&nbsp;
this is going to get worse and worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.340
um until we stop it and it will it&nbsp;
will get worse and worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.300
so I think that concludes my lesson um the main&nbsp;
key points again it's all on the website if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.180
want to read it wealth economics.org the wealth&nbsp;
and equal economy but the key points are wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:24.300
required leads to low wages very expensive asset&nbsp;
prices including house prices low social Mobility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:34.320
very difficult situation to attain Financial&nbsp;
stability uh concentration in luxury Industries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.880
Geographic concentration in in big cities and&nbsp;
the places where the rich spend their money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:49.260
um and a spiraling worsening of the situation&nbsp;
oh and one last thing um because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.640
ordinary people end up in a situation where&nbsp;
they have very little excess money it creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.620
a situation where governments can't raise&nbsp;
much tax from Ordinary People but often also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:06.420
don't raise tax from the rich for a variety of&nbsp;
reasons the rich or newspapers on lobbyists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.560
also on accountants so you end up in a situation&nbsp;
where the government ends up not being able to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.600
for its services and and coming back on public&nbsp;
services which in this country called austerity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:24.960
um so I'll recap it once more low wages High house&nbsp;
prices no social Mobility no Financial stability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.100
economic concentrations luxury Industries&nbsp;
Geographic concentration in big cities expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:39.420
rents and austerity and it gets worse year after&nbsp;
year after year so I hope I put so energy I hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.940
this video has been useful um if you like it&nbsp;
please share it use it to educate your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.700
and your family um share the message because we're&nbsp;
trying to build a movement against it and if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.840
don't do anything things get worse and worse and&nbsp;
worse and that will be really bad for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.360
so uh thank you very much we're going to do more&nbsp;
educational videos like videos like this but um&nbsp;&nbsp;
