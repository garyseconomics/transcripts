00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.540
okay today we are going to talk about&nbsp;
flows of wealth and how people get rich

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.000
okay so wealth, what it is, who owns it &amp; how it&nbsp;
flows around the economy is something which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.920
is almost not taught at all in university economics&nbsp;
courses and for that reason many economists don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.320
think about it very much this means that if you&nbsp;
understand it you can have an advantage over most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
economists and you can understand the economy&nbsp;
much more clearly than a lot of economists think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
um it's super important to understand it because&nbsp;
the wealth distribution has changed massively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.940
in the last 20 years um I think that has really&nbsp;
dominated changes in the economy and understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800
the way that wealth moves around has basically&nbsp;
enabled me to predict better than economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
after the 2008 crisis and also&nbsp;
here in the covid19 crisis so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.340
if you understand this you can understand what's&nbsp;
happening in the economy and what you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.540
do basically to protect your family and your&nbsp;
financial interests so number one you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.460
understand what wealth is, wealth is not income&nbsp;
whenever we talk about wealth on this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.160
we're not talking about your job or your salary&nbsp;
we're talking about the assets that you own

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.580
wealth is about physical assets uh in this country&nbsp;
the UK and in most Western countries the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.620
single form of wealth in terms of value is&nbsp;
residential property so I'm talking to you from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.060
a flat that I own you're probably watching this&nbsp;
from a flat or apartment that you own or you rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.220
this country &amp; this world is full of residential&nbsp;
properties they are all owned that's the single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.660
biggest form of wealth um people are used&nbsp;
to this kind of wealth because most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.560
either own a property or aspire to one day own a&nbsp;
property it's a form of wealth that we understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.900
it's important to understand that residential&nbsp;
property is not the only form of wealth there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.740
are other huge forms of wealth and if you want to&nbsp;
understand them just walk down your high street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.900
and have a look around so I'm talking to you from&nbsp;
Canary Wharf just around the corner there's a ton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.720
of massive skyscrapers full of offices those are&nbsp;
all owned if you go down the high street you'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.540
supermarkets, shopping centres, bars, restaurants&nbsp;
those are all owned as well if you go out into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
countryside you'll see farmland that's all owned&nbsp;
if you live in a part of the world that has factories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.640
you'll see factories full of machinery that's&nbsp;
another big source of wealth natural resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.360
such as oil, coal, the windmills that produce our&nbsp;
energy these are all kinds of wealth so the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.160
is absolutely full of wealth one other big source&nbsp;
of wealth is debt so if you own your own property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.500
there's a big chance that you are owning it with&nbsp;
a mortgage somebody owns your mortgage so if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.080
own a property worth half a million pounds with&nbsp;
a 400 000 pound mortgage effectively you only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.780
own 20% of your property and other 80% is owned&nbsp;
by the person who lent you the money there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.900
also an enormous amount of government debt in&nbsp;
this country in the UK and many other countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.420
all of this debt is owed to somebody is owned by&nbsp;
somebody, debt is another massive form of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.240
so I want to cover words quickly because I think&nbsp;
sometimes words are used in a way that confuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.620
what wealth is, wealth is not income income is your&nbsp;
salary from your work wealth is about ownership&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.040
of assets. Capital/Assets these are all basically&nbsp;
interchangeable - Wealth, Capital, Assets these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.000
fixed assets property that you can own that's&nbsp;
wealth. money is not the same as wealth

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.040
money is one specific kind of wealth a lot of people&nbsp;
who are who are extremely rich don't have a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.300
amount of money for very rich people money is&nbsp;
generally only a tiny percentage of their wealth&nbsp;

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.540
so that's it wealth is assets wealth is&nbsp;property 
um I think for most ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.900
because they struggle even to own just the home&nbsp;
that they live in they tend not to understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.420
the world is full of wealth commercial wealth in&nbsp;
many cases that they generally don't own much of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.920
so that moves us on to the next point&nbsp;
which is who owns the wealth and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.760
so there are lots of different forms of wealth&nbsp;
and I want to separate residential property from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.500
commercial wealth and debt because the way&nbsp;
that these are owned are very different now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.680
in this country the UK and in also the United&nbsp;
States, Europe, Australia, all of the places where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.560
these these videos are watched we still have&nbsp;
a relatively large property owned middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.680
by which I mean people who are not particularly&nbsp;
rich but they own the property that they live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.380
now that makes residential property quite&nbsp;
unusual because it's the only form of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.960
where a large amount of ordinary people&nbsp;
own a big chunk of the wealth that exists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.240
when it comes to other wealth like commercial&nbsp;
property or debt; mortgage debt, government debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.100
those forms of wealth are overwhelmingly owned by&nbsp;
very rich people now we sometimes get comments on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.600
the video saying well that's not true because&nbsp;
ordinary people do own commercial wealth for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.560
example in their pension funds and that is&nbsp;
true if you have a pension your pension will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.760
basically invest in owning corporations&nbsp;
which will often own commercial property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.560
or it will own for example government debt if&nbsp;
you have a large amount of cash in the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.680
your bank would essentially be owning forms of&nbsp;
debt for you like government debt but there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.540
big difference in the sense that when it comes to&nbsp;
residential property a huge amount of is owned by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.920
a normal people whereas when we look at commercial&nbsp;
property even though ordinary people do own&nbsp;some&nbsp;

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.780
through for example their pension fund it is&nbsp;tiny 
compared to the amount owned by the very rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.540
now very rich people what they will tend to have&nbsp;
is they'll have what's called a family office and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.160
that's basically a small business which will&nbsp;
hire lawyers and accountants which basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.960
manages the ownership of assets um they will own&nbsp;
businesses, land, commercial property, huge amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.600
of stocks and shares they will own debt and that&nbsp;
would all be managed for them so there's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.600
a split where residential property is often owned&nbsp;
by ordinary families although often through large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.160
amounts of debt whereas all the other forms&nbsp;
of wealth; commercial wealth, corporations, debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.080
tend to be overwhelmingly owned by the rich&nbsp;
ok so that's the setup there's a huge amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.580
wealth in the world; residential property,&nbsp;
commercial property, natural resources, land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.940
but ordinary families are only really owning&nbsp;
the residential property the rest of the assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.560
a tiny bit is owned by ordinary families&nbsp;
through their pensions and the rest is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.800
owned largely by the rich I want to talk about&nbsp;
the cash flows that this creates in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.540
so every single time you use an asset you use a&nbsp;
piece of wealth that you don't own you have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.800
some money to the owner of the asset the owner of&nbsp;
that wealth the most obvious example of this is if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.940
you rent the property that you live in every month&nbsp;
you have to pay rent to the owner of that property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.620
if you own the property that you live in&nbsp;
but with a mortgage every month you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.800
to pay the mortgage interest to the owner of the&nbsp;
mortgage but it goes beyond just property right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.120
say you go to the hairdressers for your haircut&nbsp;
the money that you pay doesn't all go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.820
guy that cut your hair some of it will go to the&nbsp;
person who owns the building that the hairdresser&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:33.300
is in some of it will go to the person who lent a&nbsp;
business loan so that hairdresser to get started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.780
if you go to the supermarket and you buy food in&nbsp;
the supermarket most of the money that you pay to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.460
buy that food will not go to the workers in the&nbsp;
supermarket some of it will go to the owners of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.840
the land where that food was grown some of it&nbsp;
will go to the owners of the physical building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.840
that the supermarket is in some of it will go&nbsp;
to the shareholders of the company the owners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.080
of the supermarket company itself and this&nbsp;
extends to every single purchase that you make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.500
when you go take a flight to go on holiday that&nbsp;
doesn't mainly go to the workers of the airline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.360
it goes to the owners of the planes it goes to&nbsp;
the owners of the airports so every single time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.380
you spend money you are giving a bit of money to&nbsp;
the owners of the wealth the owners of the assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.900
even when you pay your taxes a big chunk&nbsp;
of that is going to pay debt interest to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.280
people who lent money to the government so&nbsp;
even then a big chunk of the money that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.500
paying is going to the owners of the wealth&nbsp;
now the reason this is important is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.040
in many cases the wealth that you're accessing&nbsp;
is wealth that you literally need to live it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:49.920
access to a property it's food it's electricity&nbsp;
energy basic transport so what this means is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.720
in many cases your whole salary or a massive 
chunk&nbsp;of it can go towards accessing the wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.960
that you need to live so if you have a salary of 
£30-40,000&nbsp;a year very easily £20-30,000 of&nbsp;it&nbsp;

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:10.740
can end up going to the owners of the assets&nbsp;
that you need to live your life so this creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.280
a massive cash flow every single year you are&nbsp;
paying a big chunk of your salary to the owners of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.980
the wealth on the flip side of it the people who&nbsp;
own the wealth are receiving a massive cash flow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.920
from you every year so if we consider for example&nbsp;
Rishi Sunak who's worth estimated £700 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.840
he will receive about £2,000,000-£3,000,000 a year 
in pure cash flows from the wealth&nbsp;that he owns

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.460
that means assets that he owns and&nbsp;when you 
use them you have to pay him to use them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.520
so we have this massive cash flow going on from&nbsp;
people who don't own wealth to people who own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.280
huge amounts of wealth, what does that mean and&nbsp;
what does that create in terms of flows of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.280
itself? well again let's use our favourite man 
of&nbsp;the moment Rishi Sunak he's receiving&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.200
£3 million a year every single year because of&nbsp;the 
wealth that he owns from you from other ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:11.880
families now what will Rishi Sunak do with that&nbsp;
money now very wealthy people they don't generally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:19.260
like to accumulate money when their pile of money&nbsp;
grows they like to diversify that into owning more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:25.800
forms of wealth now in a strong economy with lots&nbsp;
of growth opportunities this isn't necessarily a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.180
bad thing because they can use that money to make&nbsp;
new investments and create new forms of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.300
but when we have a weak economy with a weak&nbsp;
consumer companies aren't willing to grow and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:44.040
that means wealthy people tend to use this very&nbsp;
large income to buy more of the existing wealth  

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.920
so you can see this creates a troubling dynamic&nbsp;
right every year ordinary families go to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.840
they get their salary they give most of their&nbsp;
salary to the rich and the rich use that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:01.020
to buy the existing assets from ordinary families&nbsp;
that means that next year ordinary families have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.360
less assets, rich families have more assets, which&nbsp;
means ordinary families give a larger amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.500
cash to the rich which means they can use that&nbsp;
to buy even more assets from ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.420
this can create a dangerous spiral where money&nbsp;
gets sucked away from ordinary families and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.400
rich families accumulate money. the way that these&nbsp;
ordinary families tend to lose that world is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.880
the older generation sells the property to pay for&nbsp;
their retirement and the younger generation never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.320
gets property now if you consider these ordinary&nbsp;
families from a generational perspective you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.080
see they're going from being property 
owning to not&nbsp;property owning but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.480
older generation sees we got a property and 
now we're selling&nbsp;it to pay for our retirement

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.520
and the younger generation simply sees 
we&nbsp;can't afford to to get a property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.360
it's important to ask you know where are&nbsp;
those properties going and in many cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.460
this is the manifestation of those flows of&nbsp;
cash from the ordinary families to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.860
the rich accumulate money they give that money to&nbsp;
their kids and then their kids buy the property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:05.820
that your kids then cannot afford or in other&nbsp;
cases they lend the money which your kids then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.720
have to borrow so what you see is this increase&nbsp;
in wealth inequality which is balancing those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.000
flows of cash from ordinary families to the rich&nbsp;
is manifesting in two main ways which is number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
1. a smaller percentage of ordinary families&nbsp;
being able to own properties and number &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.020
2. those who do get properties having to borrow much&nbsp;
more money from the rich to get it what this means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.520
is that the Next Generation has to spend more&nbsp;
time renting and pay a large amount of interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.760
but both Generations if they look at themselves&nbsp;
in isolation they see themselves getting richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.080
over time but if they were to compare themselves&nbsp;
with their kids and their parents what you see is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.300
ordinary families getting poorer generation after&nbsp;
generation after generation so this brings us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.940
the question of how do people get rich now I&nbsp;
think ordinary families and ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.760
tend to think the best way to get rich is through&nbsp;
working and I am somebody who who did get rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:09.360
through working but the reality of the situation&nbsp;
is its almost impossible to get as rich through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:16.140
working as you can ever get by simply compounding&nbsp;
wealth and getting more and more wealth over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.100
so if you are as rich as Rishi Sunak (700 million
pounds)&nbsp;you'll make every single year 3 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.900
4 million pounds something like that just for&nbsp;
getting out of bed that will then grow and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.560
will have more wealth the next year and it will&nbsp;
compound up I think it was Albert Einstein that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.280
said compound interest is the greatest force&nbsp;
in the world or it's often attributed to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.340
but this is the way that it works rich people get&nbsp;
a huge amount of money from you for being rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.920
and then they use that money to then buy your&nbsp;
assets which means they get more money from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.360
which they can then use to buy from all of your&nbsp;
assets and over time you see wealth get sucked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.560
out of the middle class bit by bit&nbsp;
in the forms of losing their homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.680
not being able to accumulate pensions and having&nbsp;
much larger amounts of debt now this was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.080
dynamic which I kind of recognised back in 2011&nbsp;
which enabled me to predict that basically our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.060
economy would never recover because you could see&nbsp;
that ordinary families were losing more and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.860
and more wealth that means that they will not&nbsp;
be able to spend money that means that ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.160
businesses will fail that means that ordinary&nbsp;
people's wages will fall over time so I think once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.320
you understand the flows of wealth you can see&nbsp;
that our middle class will shrink living standards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.060
will shrink and the economy will continue to fail&nbsp;
and this is the realisation I had back in 2011&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.120
um and it was also the realisation I had in&nbsp;2020 
when Covid happened because you could see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.460
that the wealthy were going to get massively&nbsp;
more rich if you know the way that the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.060
behave you will know they will use that money to&nbsp;
buy assets from middle class that would increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.800
inequality more and that will lead this spiral to&nbsp;
accelerate so when you look at the whole picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.820
what you can see is that that the situation&nbsp;
is basically phenomenally bleak because if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.960
in the absence of any action being taken it has&nbsp;
become inevitable that ordinary families and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.040
existing middle class will over time lose all of&nbsp;
their assets and that will happen generationally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.580
so it'll be difficult for you to see it as an&nbsp;
individual but if you compare yourself to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.380
parents and your kids and your grandkids you will&nbsp;
see each generation getting poorer over time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.420
that will lead inevitably to more and more falling&nbsp;
living standards um and we can see it we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.760
happening now as inequality increases the rich get&nbsp;
richer ordinary families lose their assets and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.880
middle class becomes poorer that hits the economy&nbsp;
so I think if you look at the flows of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.320
you can understand really clearly that&nbsp;
things will inevitably get worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.720
it's important to understand that most economists&nbsp;
do not look at this because it's simply not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.460
included in economics degrees economists tend not&nbsp;
to look at the wealth distribution or understand who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.260
has wealth which different groups have wealth&nbsp;
um and that means that they will probably not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.680
understand this is going to happen before it's too&nbsp;
late um that is a very bleak message um but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.080
important that you understand that is what's going&nbsp;
to happen um the rich will get richer because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.640
the large amounts of wealth flowing to them 
and the middle class will disappear um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.120
the reason it's important that you understand is&nbsp;
because number one you can try to protect yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.040
um what can you do as individuals well the main&nbsp;
thing you can do is try and reduce your spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.140
as much as possible I understand that in many&nbsp;
cases that is not possible most people are already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.760
at bare minimum and other cases that means giving&nbsp;
up you know the few luxuries you have in life um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:37.080
that's not a message I want to send um but there&nbsp;
is an alternative you know we can try to prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.820
this massive flow of wealth we can try and reverse&nbsp;
it I think it's important to understand if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.580
don't reverse that flow of wealth it is inevitable&nbsp;
that living standards will decline aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.620
in this country and in other countries around&nbsp;
the world so really we've got a choice either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.280
start wealth flowing back from the rich&nbsp;
to ordinary families which would involve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:07.260
get rid of tax loopholes, greater taxation of wealth&nbsp;
rather than income, focus taxation on the rich or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.120
we have to accept basically the middle... the&nbsp;
middle class will disappear and a collapse into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.280
broad poverty in this country the UK in Western&nbsp;
Europe in the US that is that is inevitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.460
um you know I'm a betting man I'm a trading man&nbsp;
I bet every year on what will happen um if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:29.280
understand the flows of wealth I think you know&nbsp;
basically with certainty there will be a collapse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.840
into poverty um but at the same time the rich&nbsp;
will get massively richer so asset prices will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.700
become very expensive that's been monetisable I&nbsp;
bet every year on on big increases in asset prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:47.520
um but but it will be a disaster basically so um&nbsp;
really I would encourage you to help us try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:54.540
stop this from happening because um I make money&nbsp;
betting on this year after year but um I probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.800
prefer if the disaster didn't happen because it&nbsp;
would be terrible for our society and for our kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.300
um and the only way to stop that is to um&nbsp;
basically force governments to raise tax on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.720
the rich because if we don't do that things will&nbsp;
get worse and worse in many cases the government's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.880
are controlled or in this case we have a prime&nbsp;
minister who directly is some of the richest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.080
people in the world they're not going to do&nbsp;
our unless we make them do it so um we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.060
going to keep trying to push for a reduction in&nbsp;
inequality if we don't do that there will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.340
disastrous collapse in living standards&nbsp;
we don't want it to happen we don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.460
you want that to happen either so&nbsp;
um yeah support us help grow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.020
channel and um yeah let's try and stop the&nbsp;
disaster before it gets any worse thank you

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.420
money currently is flowing from&nbsp;
the government to the rich leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.380
government with big piles of debt and&nbsp;
the rich with big piles of money

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.640
theres 1 other thing they can do with that massive&nbsp;
amount of income; they can buy your mom's house
