00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.480
Okay i wanted to do a quick video updating&nbsp;
the current situation with the economy&nbsp;and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.440
especially the situation with tax and&nbsp;payments
for social care because these things have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.800
changed recently there's been a lot of coverage on&nbsp;
it but i want to put a bit of economic perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.840
okay so uh in October we did a video talking&nbsp;
about why Rishi Sunak is raising your taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.480
if you haven't seen that go check it out
but basically Rishi Sunak raised 2.5%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.600
on national insurance which means an
extra 2.5% tax taken off of everbody's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.960
wages but not coincidentally&nbsp;billionaires
like Rishi Sunak's father-in-law's&nbsp;income

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.000
they raised 2.5% tax on ordinary workers but&nbsp;
it does not apply to income earned by billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.840
now the reason they raised those taxes is&nbsp;
because they needed money to pay for elderly care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.600
at the moment there's a situation where people&nbsp;
have to sell their homes to pay for their elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.920
care people don't like this the government&nbsp;
wants to change it so what have they done how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.880
they implemented this protection for elderly care&nbsp;
what they've done is they basically said everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.200
has to pay the first £80,000 towards their&nbsp;social
care and above that the government's gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.560
cover the bill if you have a £1,000,000&nbsp;
in assets you have to use 8% of your&nbsp;assets

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.920
if you are an ordinary family and&nbsp;
you've got assets of maybe £200,000&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.480
it might be less by the time you get very old&nbsp;
£150,000 you are going to end up having to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.080
half of your assets away to pay for elderly care&nbsp;
so we have a situation here where the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.280
has raised taxes two and a half percent on&nbsp;
ordinary workers but not all on billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.600
and then they're using that&nbsp;
money to completely protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840
almost all of the wealth of&nbsp;
millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.320
but poorer families will be forced to lose almost&nbsp;
all of the assets including their home so we're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
a situation here where the government is raising&nbsp;
tax on ordinary workers but not on the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.080
to protect the assets of the rich and the super&nbsp;
rich and not the assets of ordinary workers

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.480
and to put this in context we're coming out of&nbsp;
covid an economic crisis in which ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.040
are seeing rises in their bills their food costs&nbsp;
often financial hardship and we have seen the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.840
biggest ever single year increase in billionaire&nbsp;
wealth 22% increase in billionaire wealth the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.280
top 250 richest families in the country saw
their wealth increased by over £106 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.200
which is more than 10 times what is needed&nbsp;
to pay for the annual cost of social care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.320
so it's crazy what's happening um if you want to&nbsp;
understand why the rich have gotten so rich during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.600
Covid check out my first video on this channel&nbsp;
"why the rich are getting rich from Covid-19"

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.160
but the most important thing is understand what's&nbsp;
happening here we have a chancellor whose father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.200
in-law is a billionaire, a prime minister who is a&nbsp;
multi-millionaire or will become multi-millionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.720
as soon as he leaves office, they're raising taxes&nbsp;
on workers, they're not taxing the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
and they're protecting the assets of the super&nbsp;
rich and they're not protecting assets of workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960
this is going to mean that wealth flows&nbsp;
from ordinary people to the super rich

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.720
it's going to mean that ordinary families&nbsp;
cannot afford to get homes for their&nbsp;kids

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.480
um ordinary families kids will struggle&nbsp;
to find a place to raise their families in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.560
this is going to affect the economy check&nbsp;
out the video "what is wealth?" to see like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.440
what wealth means and how inequality of wealth&nbsp;
affects the economy we're going to do another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.600
video soon explaining really clearly exactly&nbsp;
how inequality of wealth damages the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.600
but more importantly understand the situation&nbsp;
you're being taxed, the rich are not being taxed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.080
the rich are having their assets protected you're&nbsp;
not having assets protected ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920
are struggling to get properties for their kids&nbsp;
ordinary workers are struggling to buy homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.240
and the super-rich have had their biggest&nbsp;
every single year increase in wealth so yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.120
we're going to talk about how we can fight this in&nbsp;
upcoming videos but um yeah let your friends know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.600
what is happening because um it's important here&nbsp;
wealth is being lost by ordinary families and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.520
been accumulated by the rich which includes&nbsp;
a lot of members of our government that's all

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.360
so it's intentionally designed national&nbsp;insurance
so that very rich people&nbsp;pay a very low percent

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.920
there is one other&nbsp;thing they can do
with that mass amount of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.800
they can buy your mum's house
