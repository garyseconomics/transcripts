00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.920
I'm Gary Stevenson 
former&nbsp;trader and people's economist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.440
this is Gary's Economics and today&nbsp;
we're here at Oxford University to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.920
talk about the big question everybody's&nbsp;
asking; why are economists always wrong?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.480
in 2005 when i was 18 i started studying&nbsp;
economics at the London School of Economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.040
that's one of the top economics universities&nbsp;
in the world i studied economic theory there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.360
for three years before going into the city&nbsp;
in 2008 when a financial crisis happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.680
when i was there our job was to predict when will&nbsp;
the economy recover now in 2008 we predicted 2009&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.040
in 2009 we predicted 2010, in 2010 we predicted&nbsp;
2011 and at the beginning of 2020 last year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.080
we were still predicting a recovery later that&nbsp;
year and it wasn't just the traders in the markets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.200
the economists here at Oxford University&nbsp;
were predicting the same thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.880
so economists all over the world in all the&nbsp;
governments and at the Bank of England too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.040
now this is a really really big problem right&nbsp;
economists are the guys whose job it is to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.040
economic problems now if we've got an economic&nbsp;
problem that keeps getting worse and worse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.160
worse but these guys constantly think things are&nbsp;
about to get better then they are not going to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.920
that problem right that means things will&nbsp;
continue to get worse for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.400
so this is a big problem which we need&nbsp;
to address so we've come here today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:39.840
to Oxford University to address this question&nbsp;
why is it that economists are always wrong?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.680
this is the Oxford University Economics&nbsp;
department, I studied here from 2017 to 2 019.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.480
now when i was here we had the lecturer teach us&nbsp;
a lecture on interest rates which is exactly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.880
product i traded and made millions of pounds&nbsp;
trading because economists all over the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.280
incorrectly predicted a recovery for 10 years&nbsp;
in a row after the lecture i went up to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.480
lecturer and said look can we talk about why it&nbsp;
was that economist got this so wrong for so long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
and he said to me like no that didn't happen we&nbsp;
always know interest rates were going to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.840
low we knew it would be a long recovery and you&nbsp;
know i didn't even know what to say when he said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.200
that because you know i'd been watching this as&nbsp;
a job you know for like the previous like six&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.680
seven years of my life i knew he wasn't right and&nbsp;
i said you know that's not right you got it wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.240
he didn't believe it so i said don't worry&nbsp;
i'll go i'll send you the data i sent the data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.280
and he said "oh yeah that's interesting" but this&nbsp;
guy is a professor teaching interest rates at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.880
Oxford University and he doesn't realize that&nbsp;
these guys have predicted it incorrectly for 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.160
years in a row like that is crazy right not only&nbsp;
are these guys so bad that their predictions are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.560
wrong 10 years in a row they are so bad that they&nbsp;
don't even realise they're bad they don't realise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280
they've made those wrong predictions okay so why&nbsp;
did that happen all right in order to illustrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.720
why that happened i brought in some of the work&nbsp;
i did when i was here okay so this is my folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.280
when i was here at oxford and let's look at what&nbsp;
a typical economic student does oxford university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.840
you can see there it's a nice page of&nbsp;
algebra we'll go to another page there

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.240
there you go it's a slightly shorter page&nbsp;
of algebra we'll flip through a bit shall we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.800
another page of algebra we'll flip&nbsp;
towards the end more algebra and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.520
know i could keep going through this algebra&nbsp;
so much so i had to turn the pitch sideways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.480
algebra algebra algebra that's all we're doing&nbsp;
here if you thought that we were talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.720
the housing crisis we're not if you thought we're&nbsp;
talking about why your wages don't go up we're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.480
if you thought we're talking about why you can't&nbsp;
get a good job in the city where you grew up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.520
we're not all we're doing is algebra algebra&nbsp;
algebra now i found this very frustrating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.600
and to be honest i used to get quite angry&nbsp;
when i was here and one of the professors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.080
asked me you know why are you so angry and&nbsp;
i said i'm angry because you're not talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.520
about what's happening in people's lives you know&nbsp;
why are you not talking about the housing crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.120
and he said to me we don't talk about the housing&nbsp;
crisis because it's only in London which its not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.080
by the way but I said to him look the housing&nbsp;
crisis is only in London because that's where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.760
the jobs are people have to move to London that's&nbsp;
where the jobs are and he said that's not true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.720
i've got a job, this guy is a macroeconomics&nbsp;
professor at oxford university so you're telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.800
me like some guy's lost his job in Grimsby&nbsp;
or in Wigan or in Stoke or in Cardiff &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.840
you're going to turn around to them and say oh&nbsp;
don't worry have you thought about being a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.320
macroeconomics professor at Oxford university 
yeah&nbsp;it's madness and it shouldn't be acceptable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.880
so let's talk about how is it that this&nbsp;
person thinks it's acceptable to say this

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.480
this is Keble College, Oxford this was my college&nbsp;
when i studied here this is the kind of place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.120
where economics professors and students might&nbsp;
come in the evening wearing their bow ties and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.480
their capes and have a fancy dinner in a harry&nbsp;
potter dining hall now the thing you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.000
know about economics is that it is the least&nbsp;
socially diverse of all major subjects in phd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.160
it has the highest number of students who have&nbsp;
parents from privileged backgrounds and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.360
lowest number of students who have parents from&nbsp;
ordinary backgrounds what this means is when these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.640
guys make predictions that are incorrect they are&nbsp;
not the ones that get hurt when house prices go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.120
that's okay that's okay because their families&nbsp;
own a lot of property when wages fall that's okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.840
because their wages don't fall when inequality&nbsp;
goes up they are the group that is getting richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.240
rather than the  big group which is getting poorer&nbsp;
these guys are not affected by the incorrect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.680
predictions but not only that the fact that they&nbsp;
are so separated from ordinary society means they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.040
are unable to understand what's happening in the&nbsp;
last 13 years the main problem has been not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.120
people spending money and the economists here&nbsp;
they don't understand why that's happening now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.240
i know the people watching understand why that's&nbsp;
happening ordinary people understand but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.520
i asked an economist here what did he say? I said&nbsp;
why are people not spending money and he said we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.800
don't really know but we think it's because of an&nbsp;
exogenous shock to consumption savings preferences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760
that's what he said an exogenous shock&nbsp;
to consumption savings preferences now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.400
you don't need to understand what that means&nbsp;
to know that's nonsense you know because i've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.480
asked a lot of people why they're not&nbsp;
spending and nobody ever said it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.520
because of the exogenous shock to their&nbsp;
consumption savings preferences okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.120
this guy is so disconnected he cannot even&nbsp;
understand why ordinary people don't spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.800
more money okay now listen when i worked at&nbsp;
Citibank i was lucky enough to work with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.880
fantastically intelligent trader who didn't&nbsp;
go to university he just came from an ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240
background in Liverpool and worked his way&nbsp;
up to the top which you can't really do now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.800
when i worked with him i used to bring my&nbsp;
textbooks in to study economics to try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160
understand what's happening and one day he came&nbsp;
over he just took those textbooks and he threw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.680
them in a bin and he said gary look if you want to&nbsp;
understand the economy go and talk to your parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.160
talk to your friends and their families understand&nbsp;
the economic situation ask what's happening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.800
them walk down the high street see what shops are&nbsp;
closing down see if there's more homelessness you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.600
know look at the adverts on the tube and on the&nbsp;
street that is gonna teach you what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.080
in the economy all right look everybody&nbsp;
watching this video i want you to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.280
you are the economy your family is the&nbsp;
economy your communities are the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.120
your economic problems are the economic problems&nbsp;
and those are the things that people here should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.760
be talking about but look around you do you&nbsp;
think those are the things that these people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.680
are worried about they're not because when&nbsp;
inequality increases those people get richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.720
their lives don't get worse they *get*&nbsp;better 
so they can predict wrong as much as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.520
like they've still got comfortable lives they're&nbsp;
still getting paid their families and communities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.240
are still doing perfectly well the economists here&nbsp;
don't understand why people aren't spending money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.600
but i understand and you understand we&nbsp;
understand because we are ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.560
from ordinary families we know what's happening&nbsp;
these guys don't understand because they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.200
ordinary people from ordinary families are not&nbsp;
spending more money because they are not getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.720
any more money because that money is flowing to&nbsp;
the rich and these guys here wearing their bow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.200
ties and teaching in castles are not going to&nbsp;
help us and a chancellor who is a billionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.680
is not going to help us and a prime minister who&nbsp;
is a multi-millionaire is not going to help us we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.240
have to help us we have to make it happen and the&nbsp;
way we do that is by educating ourselves and each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.120
other about economics by teaching each other that&nbsp;
the key thing we need to fix is wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.160
by teaching each other that if we don't fix&nbsp;
wealth inequality things are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.040
get better but we'll get worse but if we do fix&nbsp;
it things can get so much better for all of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.800
so please go watch what is wealth educate&nbsp;
yourselves teach your friends teach your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.360
tell them what's happening the only way we are&nbsp;
going to get better lives for ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.800
is by fixing wealth inequality so&nbsp;
tell each other what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.840
anyway it's nearly time for dinner so I&nbsp;
gotta go put my bow tie on, keep watching

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.160
but poorer families will be forced&nbsp;to lose almost 
all of their assets&nbsp;including their home

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.234
we have a tax system which is&nbsp;very efficient 
at taxing ordinary working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:56.640
but very inefficient at taxing the super rich
