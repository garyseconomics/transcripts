00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Welcome back
to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.040
Today we are going
to bring you up

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.480
to speed
with everything

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.120
that has happened
on the economy.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.920
So I've been away
for six months.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920
I want to do
a video

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.840
to basically

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.240
bring you up

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.440
to date
with everything

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.120
that's
been happening

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.840
in that time
on the economy.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.400
The first thing

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.720
to say

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.760
is that

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.200
really,
in many ways,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.480
nothing has
changed.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.280
Things
have continued

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.440
to progress

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.280
basically
in the way

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.000
that I expected
that it would,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.520
the way
that I've been

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.800
saying
that they will.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.360
And this

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.200
is because,
in my opinion,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.480
the economy
continues

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
to be dominated

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.360
by the enormous
amount of money

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.600
that was
transferred

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.880
from government
to very

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.640
rich individuals
during COVID.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.280
Those numbers have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.000
increased slightly,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.640
so I used to speak

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.840
a lot about £750
billion

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.880
that total

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.120
government deficit
since COVID

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.560
now is £800
billion in the UK.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.880
So that's £16,000

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.480
for every adult
in the country.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.720
That's the total
amount of money

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.040
to the rich from
the government.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.080
In the US,
the number is

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.920
$10 trillion,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.560
eyewatering

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.000
$10 trillion,
which is $80,000

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.680
for every US
taxpayer.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.040
So enormous
amounts of cash

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.000
have gone
from the government

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.800
to the rich.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.560
In my opinion,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.200
those continue
to drive

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.040
the economy
and things

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.720
are basically
progressing

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.680
as I said
they would.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680
And we're going
to talk about now

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800
what will happen
from now.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.600
So let's go through

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.640
the main points
one at time.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.840
Number
one is inflation.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.760
Inflation
is obviously

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.160
the big thing,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.560
which has been

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.240
hurting people's
living

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.560
standards in
the last few years.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.720
We have
seen inflation fall

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.080
significantly
in basically

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.520
every country

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.240
in the world
in the last year

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.760
or so from highs of

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.080
in the UK, 10% down

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.400
to now, about

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.280
4% in the UK

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.120
and other countries
already

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.720
significantly
lower.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.680
Now this is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.600
what I predicted.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.320
It's basically

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.960
what all economists
predicted.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.440
We did a video

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.240
maybe about eight
or nine months ago

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360
when Rishi Sunak,
the Prime Minister,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.520
basically

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.400
said he would
cut inflation

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.200
and at that point

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.600
in time

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.320
it was already

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.400
very obvious
that pretty much

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.160
everyone
that inflation

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.640
was going to fall.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.800
So this is not a
surprise to anyone.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.440
Now, for me,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.480
this is
pretty much in line

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120
with what
you would expect

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.520
if you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.200
see a one off
massive cash gift

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.000
from governments
to the richest.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.960
The rich accumulate
a ton of money.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.120
They spend
that money

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.240
that pushes
prices up.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.880
But because it was
a one off

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.480
cash gift,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.160
we see a one off

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.640
increase
in the price level

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.400
and then those
prices

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720
start to subside.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.320
Some people

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.840
think inflation

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.200
will come all
the way down to 2%,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.400
which
is the target.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040
Some people think
it might struggle

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.440
And stick
around these 4%,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.320
3% levels.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.000
Personally,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.040
I think we
probably will see

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.000
inflation fall
relatively quickly

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
and that brings us
to number two,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640
which is interest
rates.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.680
Now the Central
Bank,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.360
Bank of England

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.760
or the Fed,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.920
if you’re
in the US,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.280
move interest rates

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.440
to try and manage
inflation.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.320
So since inflation
is falling,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.480
the expectations
for interest

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.520
rates
have also fallen.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.320
Now, if you go back

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.920
and look at my
predictions earlier

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.280
in the year

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.840
for interest rates
and house prices,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.520
which you'll
get on to next,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.240
I said interest
rates

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.200
will keep rising

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.920
and then
as inflation

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.760
falls,
will probably start

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880
to see interest
rates flatline.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.200
At this point,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.080
markets
are basically

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.000
expecting
that to happen.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.560
So the Bank
of England base

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960
rate is
up to 5.25%. Now,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.680
they didn't
change it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.400
at the
last meeting.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.520
Markets
now expect that

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.640
that will basically
be the top.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.160
It will stay at

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.200
5.25%, as inflation

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.280
falls,
interest rates

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280
will start to fall
again.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560
There's
a lot of argument

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.680
about how far
they will fall.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.280
Markets
think that they'll

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.200
probably come down

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.920
to eventually
about 4%.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.600
That might take
a couple of years.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.840
Personally,
I think that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.120
inflation will fall
further

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.200
and interest rates
will end up

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.680
coming down
lower than that.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.400
But that would
depend

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.480
based on government
policy,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.040
which will get on

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.640
to after we’ve

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.640
spoken about
the economics.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.360
The next thing is
house prices.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.920
Now I was very
aggressive

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.280
in predicting house
price rises

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.400
from the very
beginning of COVID

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.200
and we did see

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400
very aggressive
house price rises

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.240
at the beginning
of COVID.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.400
Since then,
interest rates

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.480
have risen
enormously

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.600
from 0%
up to 5.25%.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.720
And I think
a lot of people

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.160
have been surprised

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.520
that these
aggressive

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.200
interest rate
increases

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.080
have not led
to aggressive

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.400
house
price decreases.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.120
For me,
I think this is

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.040
quite
understandable

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040
when you understand

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.160
that an enormous

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.880
amount of cash
has been

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.520
accumulated
by the rich.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.320
Now, when interest
rates

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.000
go up a lot,
as they have done.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.920
Many of you
will have seen

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.120
mortgage
rates go up.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.800
It becomes
very difficult for,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.240
sort of, middle
class people,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.840
especially poorer

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.640
people,
to buy houses

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.080
because they rely
on mortgages

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.600
and those interest

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.640
rates have gone up.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.320
But in the same

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.800
time,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.600
the rich have
accumulated

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.080
an enormous
amount of money,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.600
which means that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.040
they are able
to buy houses

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.760
basically without
using a mortgage,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.480
using a very
small mortgage.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.520
So I think
what we've seen

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.640
is two things,
basically.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.040
As interest
rates have gone up,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.960
rich people have
been using their

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.800
cash savings,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.840
giving it to their
kids,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.560
giving it
to their grandkids

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.000
to buy houses
without mortgages,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.080
which is why house

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.600
prices
have not fallen

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.960
despite these big

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.400
increases
in interest rates.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.480
And the second
thing is that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.760
rich people
are able

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.080
now to get high
interest rates

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.440
on their savings
accounts.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.520
So they're sort of

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.600
sitting on the cash
they've got

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.520
getting
high interest

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.120
and using it to buy
houses.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.800
This has meant that

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.520
we haven't
seen what

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.320
a lot of people
have predicted,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.040
which is house
price falls.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.720
Now, I think

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.240
house prices is
interesting for me

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.840
because I think

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.880
probably
what we will see

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.640
next is interest

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.720
rates will start
to fall

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.520
as inflation
starts to fall.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.840
I think once those
interest rates

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840
start to fall,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.920
rich people
will stop

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.840
sitting
on these big

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.120
piles of cash
in the bank

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.080
and they will start

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.840
to lend
the money out

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.560
at lower rates
for mortgages.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.480
They will start
to buy more houses.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.880
And I'm strongly
expecting

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.400
aggressive house
price rises

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.440
in the next
couple of years

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.080
as the interest
rates fall down.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.960
So I think this
is going to lead to

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.920
a while
before that.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.720
I want to talk
about

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.680
the very last thing
we've got,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.240
which is living
standards.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.640
So inflation

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.520
has fallen
significantly.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.240
I think people are

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.160
starting
to realise now

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.560
what I was speaking
about earlier

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.680
on in the year.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.280
When inflation
falls,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.320
that doesn't
mean prices fall.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.800
So prices

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.320
have continued
to rise

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.440
throughout
the year.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.840
Prices have
consistently risen

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.440
more than wages,
which means

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.000
even as inflation
has fallen,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.720
living standards

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.720
have continued
to decrease.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
The way I see
it really is during

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.960
the three years
of COVID,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.560
we paused the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.320
economy and rapidly

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.760
increased
inequality.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.080
If you pause
the economy

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.000
and rapidly
increase inequality

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.720
when you unpause

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.120
the economy
is inevitable,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.040
you will see
a significant

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.560
fall in
living standards.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280
I think
that is basically

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.200
what we're
seeing now.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.720
The question is

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.840
what happens
from here?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.880
Because I think

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.120
the way that the
economy is being

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.280
presented
in the media at the

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.720
moment is largely
that we are

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.800
in a recession.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.360
And I think that

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.480
kind of gives
the implication

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.640
that there is
a temporary period

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.600
of decreasing

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.400
living standards

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.640
and then we will
have a recovery.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.840
I think if you want
to understand

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.080
the long term
picture,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.600
it's important

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.040
to understand
basically

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.360
the sort of second
round effects

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.720
of this large
amount of money

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.880
that has gone
to the rich.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.000
So up till now,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.280
the rich,
because they'd been

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.880
getting higher
levels of interest,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.120
have been
relatively happy

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.520
to just sit
on that money

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.600
and accumulate
the interest.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.080
Now, as inflation
starts to fall

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.160
and interest rates
start to fall,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.240
they will probably
look to invest

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.400
that money
more aggressively,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.560
which means
they will start to

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.000
essentially

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.680
buy houses from
the middle class.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.960
So what
that means is

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.880
we will see house
prices go up.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.160
We will see home
ownership rates

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.400
from young people
continue to fall.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.040
What we will also
see is

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.000
as the rich people

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.960
look to use
the money

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.640
they've accumulated

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.400
and what we already
are seeing,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.400
significant
increases in

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.080
rents,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.200
the prices
of luxury

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.640
goods, the price
of holidays.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.560
And that is, again,
something

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.400
you would expect

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400
when you

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.600
see a massive
accumulation

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.760
of cash
from the rich.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.720
That basically
means

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.120
rents will go up,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.280
house
prices will go up,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.960
and the ability of

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.800
owning homes
will become more

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.720
out of reach of
ordinary families.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.080
What that means
for young people

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.280
from ordinary

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.720
and poorer
families is

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.400
rent is much more

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.200
expensive
when you're young

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.600
and you

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.240
then have to take

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.000
out a much bigger

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.960
mortgage
to buy a house,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.440
so you have to pay

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.080
much more
in interest.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.760
This increases
the flow of rent

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.360
from the poor

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.720
to the rich

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.440
and increases

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.400
the flow
of interest

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.000
from the poor
to the rich.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.320
We also have a
massively increased

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.120
government debt,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.520
which means that
the government

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.120
is now paying debt,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.280
paying interest
to the rich.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:38.680
You are paying

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.600
interest
to the rich much

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.840
more on your taxes.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.880
So all of

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.480
these second round

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.680
effects are
essentially bad.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.200
When you give cash
to the rich,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.320
the rich use
that cash

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.200
to buy the assets

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200
from the middle
class,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.880
to buy the debt of

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880
the middle class,
to buy

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.920
the government

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.560
increased levels
of debt, decreased

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.720
levels of home
ownership means

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.880
increased
cash flows

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.200
from the

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.920
middle
class to the rich,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.360
and this will
continue to

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.080
rebound through.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.720
So what
that means is

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.440
we will continue

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.320
to see living
standards fall

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.040
in the coming year,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.840
the coming
two years.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.280
I want to talk
a little bit about

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.760
how this will

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.280
probably play out

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.520
politically,
because

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.520
we obviously have
an election

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.000
coming up next year
in this country.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.640
There's also
an election

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.960
in the states.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.120
I think

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.000
the most
important thing

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.800
you need
to understand

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.240
if you want

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.640
to understand

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.640
the future
of the economy,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.760
is that inequality

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.320
has greatly
increased.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.400
So it is inevitable

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.480
that living

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.680
standards have to
fall further.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.440
I think that will
probably dominate

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.480
the political
environment

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.320
for some time
to come.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.520
I don't think
any mainstream

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.680
political parties

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.120
at the moment
are serious

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.440
about reducing
inequality,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:52.960
which means that

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.560
inequality will

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.760
inevitably continue
to increase.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.960
So I think if you
want to understand

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.920
politics,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.560
the economic
framework you

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.440
need behind

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.200
that is to
accept that

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.680
from this point,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.520
further
significant falls

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.760
in living
standards are

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.760
basically certain,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.000
which means you...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.760
what you see

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760
is continued

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.400
dissatisfaction
in whichever

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.200
political party
is in power,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.560
be that
Conservatives

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.640
or Labour

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.160
or Democrats
or Republicans.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.880
So I think,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.280
you know,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.640
and I'm

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.280
not a professional

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.120
political
forecaster,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.840
but I'm
very confident

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520
my economic
forecast,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.600
what you will
probably see

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.760
is increased demand

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.480
for ordinary
people,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.200
for some sort

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.720
of political
alternative.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.840
So it's probably

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.680
important

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.520
that we understand

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.520
what are the likely

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.360
political
alternatives.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.520
So I'm
making this video

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.080
very shortly

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.120
after the Dutch

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.600
election in which
for the first time

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.000
ever, the Dutch
populist

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440
far right party

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.400
essentially won
the election.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.360
Got the highest
number of

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.600
seats and
votes. And I think

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.000
at the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.680
moment we are in a

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.280
situation

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.040
where living
standards

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.960
will definitely
fall.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.640
They already are
falling, clearly,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.200
and people

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.360
will start
to demand

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.360
a political
alternative.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.160
And what
that means is,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.280
it becomes
very important

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.280
what the most
feasible seeming

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.320
political
alternative is.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.640
And when I

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.320
look around

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.520
at voting trends
in Europe

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:22.960
and in the

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.560
US in trends

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.360
of political
parties,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.800
it seems to be
pretty clear that

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.640
at the moment,
the most popular

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.560
sounding
alternative

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.800
voice is increased

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.720
xenophobia,
anti-immigration

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.000
and possibly
increased racism.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And I think that
in the absence of

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.640
the creation
of a positive

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.080
alternative
narrative,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.080
it's almost certain
that politics

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.120
will move this way.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.160
And that is

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.040
a direct result
of the fact that

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.200
it is
basically certain

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.320
the economy will
keep getting worse.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.000
I think

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.360
people
are aware when

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.240
the economy they're
in is failing,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.440
especially as that
stretches on 10,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.000
20, 30 years.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.480
I think

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.840
when you know

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.600
that the boat
you're on

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.440
is sinking,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.720
you know,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.920
you're going
to basically jump

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.640
on the first
lifeboat

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.760
that you see.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.680
So I think

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.680
what we will see
from this point

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.520
further decreases

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.200
in living
standards,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.440
which could become
quite fast and

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.640
further

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.760
demand from
ordinary people

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.080
for an alternative
in politics.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.440
And unless
we can create

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.640
a positive
alternative

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.160
which says

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.400
let's distribute
wealth better,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.120
let's increased
living standards,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.120
we're
probably likely to

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.080
move towards
these sort of

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.840
far right,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.480
anti-immigration,
xenophobic

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.280
sentiments
over time.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.920
Of course,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.480
those
political parties,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.680
they will also fail

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.720
to improve
the economy

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.680
because they will
not deal

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.920
with the
fundamental problem

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.000
of inequality,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.320
which means that

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.920
unless we

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.280
create a positive
alternative,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.160
it will probably

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.200
simply shift
further

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.520
and further

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.480
to the right
and in the search

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.600
for something
that works. So

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.360
that's a relatively

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.560
depressing message
to be delivering

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.880
at the end
of the year.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.200
But I think

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.360
it also makes it

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.400
clear
the importance of

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.800
what we're doing,
which is,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.560
if we make it
clear to people

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.200
what's happening,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.640
which is that

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.360
living
standards will

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.440
continue to fall,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.760
people will know

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.320
that we need
an alternative

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.600
and we need to make
it clear

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.960
the fundamental
reason for the fall

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.640
in living
standards,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.400
which is
the increase

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.960
in inequality.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.240
If we decrease
the inequality,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.920
we can improve the
living standards.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.440
If we don't

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.520
decrease
the inequality,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.000
living standards

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.920
will continue
to decrease

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.160
and politics
will continue

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
to move in more
extreme directions.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.960
But the most

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.080
optimistic thing
I can say

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.760
is the

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.360
massive increase

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.320
in inequality mean

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.640
that we have
massive opportunity

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.280
to enormously

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.520
increase
living standards

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.840
If we simply
reverse

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.440
the increase in

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.280
inequality
that we see.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
So to conclude,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.640
the economy
continues

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.800
to be driven
by inequality.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.080
All the main

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.040
economic features
inflation, interest

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.840
rates continue to
be driven by that.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.800
Inequality
is increasing

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.640
very quickly.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.800
If we don't
decrease that,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.400
living standards
will fall.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.040
If we take action,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.840
we can make things
better.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.760
So support
the channel.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.320
We’re making lots

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.120
more videos
in the New Year.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.040
Thank you for
your support.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.600
Good luck.
