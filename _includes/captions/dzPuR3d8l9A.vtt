00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.080
When the Bank of England raises interest&nbsp;
rates they're trying to fix inflation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.720
i think inflation will come down we'll&nbsp;
talk about that a bit more in a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.240
they're trying to fix inflation but they're&nbsp;
doing nothing to fix the inequality which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.280
a fundamental problem i think this is a little&nbsp;
bit the problem with the way economists think

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.840
so the Bank of England is raising interest&nbsp;rates
a lot of people are worried about this what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.040
it means. So i'm gonna do a quick explainer&nbsp;
on what's going on. So the Bank of England&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.080
is raising interest rates to deal with inflation i&nbsp;
think the most interesting point to realise here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.840
is there's a real asymmetry between the causes of&nbsp;
the inflation and the attempt to fix the inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.720
okay so i've talked about it a lot on this channel&nbsp;
so people will know, the government essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000
gave out £450 billion pounds of cash during Covid&nbsp;
which is a truly truly enormous amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.960
the way that worked at the time is the government&nbsp;
borrowed it from the Bank of England and then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.240
gave it out um and the Bank of England pays&nbsp;
interest on this money so as i've said a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.000
it's very important to understand who got this&nbsp;
money okay, it's explained very clearly on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.960
very first video on this channel "why Covid-19 is&nbsp;
making the rich richer" that that money was largely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.400
accumulated by richer people okay so during Covid&nbsp;
the government essentially printed and gave out an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.440
enormous amount of money that ended up with&nbsp;
the rich and they pay interest on the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.840
on the money to the rich so an enormous increase&nbsp;
in inequality um it was pretty much inevitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.760
that this would always cause inflation because&nbsp;
just simply because of the enormous size of it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.880
it's important to understand that it also&nbsp;causes
a permanent cash flow from the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.000
to the rich because the rich have this £450 billion&nbsp;
now and the government pays interest on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.520
money it's actually the Bank of England that pays&nbsp;
the interest but the Bank of England is owned by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080
the government so financially it's coming from the&nbsp;
government okay um so during Covid the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.760
gave a huge amount of money out that has&nbsp;
been inevitably inflationary, if the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.760
wanted to deal with that inflation the sensible&nbsp;
thing to do which is exactly what i suggested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.440
in the first video on this channel is i need to&nbsp;
take the money back which is basically taxation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.480
um but that's not what they're doing what actually&nbsp;
is happening is that the central bank is raising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.920
the interest rate and remember the interest&nbsp;
rate is the cash flow that the government pays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.680
to the rich who have the money so if you&nbsp;
look at what's happening here in both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.080
instances it's really bad for the government which&nbsp;
is the taxpayer and really good for the rich right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.280
during Covid they gave the rich a ton of money and&nbsp;
now after Covid they're increasing the interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.160
rate that they paid to the rich on that money so&nbsp;
first the rich got a ton of money and now the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.040
are going to get even more money every year from&nbsp;
the government so from an inequality perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.440
and anyone who watches the channel regularly will&nbsp;
know, inequality is basically a cancer killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.200
our economy what's happening is is basically&nbsp;
terrible right huge amount of money was given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.680
and now more money will be given every year and&nbsp;
that money will come from the government but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.840
from anyone who is in debt which is basically if&nbsp;
you have a mortgage if you have a large mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.880
as i explained in our video what is wealth&nbsp;
that mortgage is owned largely by richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.360
people you pay interest to the rich on your&nbsp;
mortgage and that interest will go up you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.960
pay more interest to the rich so when the Bank&nbsp;
of England raises interest rates they're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.440
to fix inflation and i think inflation will come&nbsp;
down we'll talk about that a bit more in a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.880
they're trying to fix inflation but they're&nbsp;
doing nothing to fix the inequality which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.840
is a fundamental problem and i think this is a&nbsp;
little bit the problem with the way economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.480
think they see the inflation but economists&nbsp;
have a massive blind spot for inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.240
which nothing could be illustrating more than&nbsp;
the way nobody's speaking about it right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.560
and they're dealing with the inflation&nbsp;
but they're not dealing with inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.560
so inflation will come down i'm very confident&nbsp;
inflation will renormalise it might take a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.840
or so inflation will come down but inequality will&nbsp;
not come down and what that means is inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.880
will be left permanently higher which will mean&nbsp;
that ordinary people's standard of living will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.920
be left permanently lower and rich people's&nbsp;
standard living will be left permanently higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.000
so inflation will come down but these&nbsp;
changes in relative price levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.920
mainly that energy prices and food prices and&nbsp;
things like rent have become permanent and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.400
house prices have become permanently significantly&nbsp;
higher relative to wages they will remain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:30.000
so the central bank will succeed in its target of&nbsp;
reducing inflation but it will not succeed in re

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.440
re-normalising your living standards to what&nbsp;
they were before Covid, living standards will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.000
be permanently worse now just like they were&nbsp;
realistically after 2008 for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.240
living standards will be permanently worse in this&nbsp;
country and and they will continue to deteriorate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.080
so how do you stop that well the way you stop that&nbsp;
is to reverse the damage that you did during Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.560
during Covid £450 billion pounds which is £10,000&nbsp;
pounds per adult was transferred from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.280
government to the rich explained in our first&nbsp;
video that's enormous it increases inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.680
enormously um you need to fix that and the&nbsp;
way to fix that is by taking money back from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.160
the rich which is taxation and that would be a&nbsp;
symmetrical way of solving the problem you give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.440
money to the rich you want to fix it you take&nbsp;
money back from the rich what we did is we give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.680
money to the rich and then we give the rich more&nbsp;
money to raising inflation right through raising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.800
the interest rate right um so the central bank&nbsp;
will they'll fix the inflation but they won't fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.120
inequality and the way to fix inequality would&nbsp;
be to raise taxes but the central bank doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.280
control taxation right taxation is in the realm&nbsp;
of the government, the central bank only controls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.280
monetary policy which is things like interest&nbsp;
rates the central bank can't tax the rich okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.480
so that should be when the government tax&nbsp;
the rich well is the government taxing the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.280
i don't think i need really to comment on&nbsp;
that you know the chancellor-in-law's father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.720
is one of the richest billionaires in the world&nbsp;
so the chancellor's father-in-law one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.360
richest billionaires in the world doesn't seem to&nbsp;
be showing any inclination to taxing the rich those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.320
things might be connected they might not not&nbsp;
for me to say um these guys are not seriously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.520
talking about taxes in the rich which means they&nbsp;
probably won't get fixed so inflation will come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.520
back down but living standards will continue to&nbsp;
decrease and decrease and decrease and decrease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.080
um so then is the Bank of England at fault because&nbsp;
they don't control taxation policy well it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.040
their fault that tax are not being raised but what&nbsp;
is their fault is there's a lot of very well paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.080
economists at the Bank of England whose job is to&nbsp;
protect the economy of this country okay we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.400
now that £450 billion pounds which is a truly&nbsp;
enormous sum of money went from the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.480
to the rich during Covid it should be obvious&nbsp;
that that's a big causative factor in what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.680
happening now. Who at the Bank of England of all&nbsp;
these well-paid economists is talking about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.040
Andrew Bailey gets paid half a million pound&nbsp;
a year he's the chief of the bank of England&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.720
is he talking about the massive increase&nbsp;
in cash holdings by the rich during Covid?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.000
i haven't heard him talk about it in fact&nbsp;
all he said is that ordinary people should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.320
not ask for pay rises well i think all the new&nbsp;
people should be getting pay rises right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.440
the Bank of England is not a fault in the sense&nbsp;
that they can't raise taxes but they are at fault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.440
in the sense that here's a lot of very well&nbsp;
paid economists who should be protecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.480
the living standards of people in this country&nbsp;
who have allowed the largest ever and quickest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.200
ever transfer of wealth from the government to&nbsp;
the rich and have simply said nothing about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.240
you know if your job is to protect ordinary people&nbsp;
and to manage inflation and there's an enormous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.560
transfer of cash from the government to the&nbsp;
rich that causes inflation and damages ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.040
people's lives you should at the very least talk&nbsp;
about it and they're not talking about it so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.280
the Bank of England, look interest rates, the&nbsp;
market expects them to stay at about 2%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.680
level and to stabilize there um not ever&nbsp;to go
higher because they expect the economy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.680
stay weak, personally i think they will probably&nbsp;
come up and at some point come back down again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.160
and i expect we will see something like a zero&nbsp;
interest rate probably within a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.240
that's not what the market expects that's what i&nbsp;
expect um but that's because i think the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.320
will be very very weak in the long run um but&nbsp;
the most important thing to understand is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.560
even though inflation will normalise living&nbsp;
standards will not normalise and that's a terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.760
message but it's the truth um and the only way&nbsp;
to fix that is is to is to tax the rich because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.440
when you increase inequality you improve living&nbsp;
standards of the rich and you decrease living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.880
standards of the rest, that's what we're going to&nbsp;
see, um that will not fix itself and we can&nbsp;only&nbsp;

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.840
fix that by fixing taxation policies, i&nbsp;would really
love anyone who works at the Bank of&nbsp;England

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.600
or who knows anyone who works the Bank of
England&nbsp;to get in touch with me and talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.080
why they haven't said anything about this massive
transfer of cash and wealth to the richest because i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.640
think that's, i would like to say it's criminal but to be&nbsp;
honest i think it's more a case of just stupidity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.320
i've worked with a lot of economists and they're&nbsp;
not stupid people but they seem to be phenomenally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.040
incurious people and i would love to know just&nbsp;
why nobody has spoken about it so if anyone in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.760
Bank of England can get in touch and say you know&nbsp;
maybe maybe someone has done it and if someone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.520
done it i'd love to see it but um that transfer&nbsp;of
wealth has happened the Bank of England can't fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.120
it but they can talk about it and i really wish&nbsp;
they did because it's getting boring just being me

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.200
good?  we done? yeah
