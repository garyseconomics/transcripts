00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.560
today we are going to teach you

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.960
how to argue with your friends

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.120
about wealth taxes.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.400
Okay so we are filming this in early August 2025

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.560
in an exceptionally exciting time to be an economist

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.200
to be involved in global economics

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.680
global politics 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.600
All of the traditional political parties

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240
all over the world are dying

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.280
that's happening all across Europe

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.640
it's happening here in the UK as well

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.600
we've just seen probably the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320
the death of the Conservative Party

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.600
coming up very soon.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Labour Party in power are very unpopular

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.160
all of the traditional

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.120
political parties are super unpopular

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.000
and that is because

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.600
it is becoming increasingly obvious to everybody

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.400
that the economic status quo is not working.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.400
What that means is

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.920
there is a phenomenal opportunity now to decide

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.120
as a society which way our economies are going to go

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.360
everybody knows this, the billionaires know it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720
that's why they are aggressively funding the far right

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.840
and that is why the far right is moving ahead

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.280
in this debate of how we shift our economy

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.840
but it doesn't have to go that way

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.840
a lot of people don't like the far right ideas

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.800
they don't like anti immigrant

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800
anti foreigner ideas and there is a massive

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
massive space to basically take possession of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.720
of this argent basically

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.400
the old ideas about the economy are dying

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.440
and the new ideas are yet to be born

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.200
and I think we are in a great position

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.800
to dominate

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.360
the conversation about the economy going forward

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.000
I think we're in this interesting space

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
where kind of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.840
the economic status quo of the last 30 years

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840
has failed

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.040
and you have the far right coming in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.480
and I think we are basically

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.920
probably the best positioned guys to compete with them

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.680
but what we don't have is the billionaire

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.720
funding of the far right so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.280
what I am depending on

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.800
is a kind of different model of how to educate people

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.040
how to win people over which is I educate you

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.480
you understand the economics of the situation

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.720
as fully as possible

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.400
and you use that understanding to educate your friends

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600
and educate your family

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.560
we are using a human amplification model

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
I suppose as opposed to the billionaire

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.120
and the money amplification model

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.040
which is used by the main political parties

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.080
and also by the far right media

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 but I think we can win

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.160
but in order to do that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.800
you need to know how to speak to your friends

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.520
and your family about economics

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.200
about wealth taxes about billionaires

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400
about inequality so that we can spread these ideas

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.440
and we can dominate the conversation

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.000
and then we can win over politics

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.200
and the economic situation in this country

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.280
and in yours.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.080
So I'm gonna break this down into kind of a checklist

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080
basically so

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.920
you understand all of the most important things

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.080
about how to convince your friends and family

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.040
about the importance of managing inequality

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.480
about the importance of wealth taxes

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.000
and No. 1 on the list is don't be a dick

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.400
So don't be a dick is about not

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
basically trying to force your

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.480
opinions about inequality and wealth

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000
taxes on your friends and your family

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880
in an aggressive way. I think in

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880
our culture we have this kind of idea

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.080
that the way to persuade somebody of something is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.360
to have a debate with them

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.120
 you see this all over the internet

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640
you see this all over YouTube 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.680
with this guy destroys that guy

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.320
it's totally the dominant like media narrative

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.800
the media form of of how to discuss economics

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
is we have the left wing guy

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.280
we have the right wing guy

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.600
they fight each other to the death

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.440
and somehow that persuades people

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
basically having

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.440
done this work of persuading people on the economy

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.240
for many years now I'm convinced that debates are

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.520
almost never convince anyone of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.960
of anything and they're just not a good way

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.560
to persuade people of things

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.120
 the first thing is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.280
you need to recognize where we are

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280
as an economy and as a society

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.520
and again this is relevant for the UK and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.960
and for every other western country

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
living standards are falling quite quickly

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.920
people's children and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.240
grandchildren are and will be much poorer than

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.960
than they are or they were

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.840
and that is scary you know

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.800
you know that is scary

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.400
we're here in 2025 in most of the western world

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.640
we haven't experienced like

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.680
really widespread poverty for a long time

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.920
and we're moving into widespread poverty

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.680
and that's scary

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520
and people are scared and people are stressed out 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.880
people don't know why it's happening

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.920
people don't know what to believe and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.280
yeah people are scared

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.640
people are told the problem is foreigners

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.720
people are told the problem is immigrants and really

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.760
there's not a lot of good economics education

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.080
people are running around

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.760
they're scared and they're worried

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.920
and if you wanna speak to them

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.040
you need to understand that

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.800
and if you come in aggressively

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.360
if you force people into a debate

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.960
they don't wanna have 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.520
if you shout people down

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.560
if you try and win debates against people

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.400
you're probably just gonna force people

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.560
kind of further

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.080
into their own echo chamber 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.600
into their own thoughts 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.120
into their own sort of spaces

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480
of fear and I think when people are scared

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.920
it's just really really difficult to move people

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920
into a positive space 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.480
if we're gonna fix this

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.560
it's gonna have to be through sort of building

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.960
unity between the middle class and the working class

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.720
and I don't think we're gonna achieve that

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.320
by shouting at each other

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.880
so the key thing, number one

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
don't be a dick

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.040
understand that different people are

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.280
in different situations

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.000
here in the UK recently we've had a lot of recent

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.680
like far right protests at hotels of 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.600
refugees and this kind of thing and 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.960
there has been obviously

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.920
like counter protests where people on the left go

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.840
and sort of shout at them and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.760
you know I understand that

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.120
I understand people on the left wanna protect refugees

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.640
wanna protect immigrants

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.480
it's important to recognise that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.840
people who might not be on the same side as you

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.320
are scared and they're

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.080
in an economically difficult situation

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.200
and in many cases

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.720
they're struggling to look after their kids

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.120
they're worried about their kids' futures

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.520
they're being told the problem is foreigners

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.640
they're being told the problem is immigrants 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.880
I think the problem is growing inequality

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.400
I think the problem is billionaires

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600
but you're not gonna persuade these people

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.720
just by going down and shouting at them 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.960
you need to be able to to be compassionate

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.640
to people who are in different situations

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.480
than you 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.080
that means

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.320
they might be getting different ideas from the media

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.400
they might be in different financial positions

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.280
When I talk about the economy

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.040
I'm always very aware that I am a rich person

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.760
I don't need to worry about paying the bills

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.640
if I'm talking to somebody who's not in that situation

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.720
I need to recognize that

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.960
they're in a different position

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.520
if you're a poor person

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.120
and you're talking to a richer person

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.160
you need to recognise

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.280
when you're talking about things like

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.320
taxing the rich they're gonna be scared

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.840
you're thinking about taxing them

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.000
the situation of a poor person is super different

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.280
to the middle class obviously

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.400
the middle class don't have this problem

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.840
of worrying about paying the bills

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.440
of worrying about feeding their kids

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.040
but the middle class is also being squeezed here

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.200
they're worried about things like

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.240
will my kids

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.560
be able to live the same kind of life that I did

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.280
will my kids be able to afford a home

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.120
will my kids be able to afford a family

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.360
 if you can't understand with a bit of compassion

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.600
the position of people

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.520
who might be in a different situation than you

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.080
you're never gonna persuade anyone so that's it

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.520
have a little bit of understanding

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.960
have a little bit of thoughtfulness

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.680
don't force conversations on people you don't want to

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.800
On that subject of forcing conversations

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.680
I think it's important just to recognise

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.240
when is the right place

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.320
and when is the right person to try to have like

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.480
a productive educational conversation

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.840
these kinds of things 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.880
because No. 1 if you

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.080
go home and and try and argue with

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.360
your right wing dad or uncle

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.640
 at Christmas when they don't want the conversation

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.000
all you're gonna do is build division

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.040
it's not really gonna help

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.960
 but also recognize

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.320
especially with things like arguments online

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.120
that sometimes

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.400
people who have no interest in listening to you

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.040
or understanding

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.520
you are just trying to drag you into a fight

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.880
and waste your time, wait for the right opportunity

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880
wait for the right people

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.000
wait for the right time, try and find times and spaces

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.840
where you can really have a conversation

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.040
that takes the kind of

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.720
morality out of it takes the politics out of it

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.720
and just explains very clearly

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.720
very educationally what is happening

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.840
I think that's the best way

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.600
to understand and that brings us on to point 2

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.680
which is understanding and education

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.720
so I'm a big believer that the best way to

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.200
persuade somebody of something

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.880
is to explain it very clearly

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.800
We are in a situation now where 70

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.560
80, 90% of people in this country and in your country

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.880
their kids and their grandkids

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.240
will live in desperate poverty

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.240
first take a little bit of time to sit with that

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.920
because that's a f**ked up situation

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.000
but also recognise that unless that means

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.240
unless you're talking to a very rich person

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.880
the person you are speaking to

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.640
has a strong self

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.880
interest for the future of their family

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.120
to agree with you

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.160
you should be coming into this debate in a situation

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that what your aim is

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.240
is to protect your kids from poverty

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.440
and to protect their kids from poverty

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.160
that is the truth of the situation here

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.880
for 90% of the people in the country

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.800
the working class and the middle class

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.280
unless you can unite do something

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.640
about growing inequality

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.000
you will not be able to protect your kids from poverty

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.560
so your base stance for any

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.040
I'm not gonna use the term debate

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.200
because I don't think debates help

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.040
for any conversation about the economy should be

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.320
if we don't do something

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.880
both my kids and your kids will live in poverty

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.360
so we need to do something about that

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.200
and your your main goal should be to very

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.040
very clearly explain that point

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.520
because if you can explain that point clearly

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.840
then it's not gonna be about left or right

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.440
it's not gonna be about morality

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.400
it's gonna be about the very clear

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.240
shared interest that you have

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.440
with most of the other people in your country

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.000
of protecting your kids and your grandkids from poverty

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.040
Okay so how do you effectively

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.000
clearly educate the people you are talking to

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.440
to make it clear to them

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.440
that you're trying to protect their kids from poverty

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.600
that in my opinion

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.160
is all about understanding

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.880
the best way to educate and explain a concept

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.000
in my opinion

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.720
is to understand it as clearly as possible yourself

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.240
and that is why here on this channel

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.080
I try as much as I can

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.440
to do a lot of educational videos about the economy

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.280
and I really

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.600
really try to make it as clear as possible to hopefully

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.560
you the viewer

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.160
the thing that I'm trying to explain so part of the

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.000
my philosophy on YouTube of education is I

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.120
don't ever have scripts for these videos

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.240
maybe that's obvious. I plan the videos

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.880
but I never script them I'm not reading an autocue here

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.840
the reason I do that is

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.560
because I think the best way to educate somebody

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.680
else of a thing is to really

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.640
really really understand that thing

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.760
so during the weeks when I'm planning these videos

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.920
rather than writing a script

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.280
I'm just trying my best to really understand

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.480
the situation and the concepts

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.680
and my idea is, my belief is

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.360
if you come into a situation

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.360
with a complete understanding of

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.520
of what is happening

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.840
then you should be able to explain it

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.720
without needing to read off of a script

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.640
and I think that

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.680
I think that that comes through better

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.280
that educates better and that actually communicates

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.080
the understanding better so that means

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.640
if you want to explain to people that

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.560
if they want to protect their kids

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.480
and protect their grandkids from poverty

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.480
they need to care about the wealth distribution

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.640
care about inequality care about the tax system

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.200
shift the tax burden to the rich

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.560
you firstly

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.200
need to understand that very clearly yourself

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.880
and hopefully

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.880
if you've been watching this channel for a long time

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.600
you should be able to do that because really

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.440
like my No. 1 aim, absolute No. 1 priority

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.360
aim from this channel is to reach a situation

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.640
where the vast majority of the working class

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.080
and the middle class can understand

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.400
in simple terms

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.680
why changing the tax system

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.880
is essential for protecting the financial position

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.920
of their family

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.960
the financial position of the kids and their grandkids

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.800
in case you haven't fully fully understood that by now

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.280
I'm gonna mention a few of the videos on this channel

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.840
also one on another channel

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.480
which I think are probably the best videos to watch

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.640
if you wanna understand that very simple concept

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.680
so the first one is we have got a video series

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.920
understanding the economy

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.160
which I think is three or maybe four videos now

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.480
which really explains ground up why inequality matters

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.440
why people don't talk about it enough

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.960
why it's important to protect

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.680
your family's financial position

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.240
if you wanna watch just one video 

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.120
I think ‘The Squeeze Out’ is is probably the best

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.000
I think it's

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.960
possibly the best video we've ever done on the channel

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.400
in just, in just really

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.040
really simply explaining that we have an economy

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.640
which has a small group of super rich

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.200
that are aggressively expanding their wealth share

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.720
and in doing so

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.600
they are basically out competing one at a time

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.560
every other group in society

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.400
and squeezing

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.360
the wealth out of other groups in society

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.840
and what that means is

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.320
the working class loses their wealth

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.840
the government loses their wealth

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.080
the working class goes into debt

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.240
the government goes into debt

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.520
and we are moving into the stage now

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.080
where the middle class starts to get squeezed out

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.280
as well. I think that video

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280
The Squeeze Out

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.000
really explains really clearly this basic concept

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.560
which is you cannot have one group

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.680
even if it is a tiny number of people rapidly

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.600
aggressively

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.080
in a kind of compound exponential accelerating fashion

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.160
aggressively expanding their wealth share

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.760
in a finite economy which is not growing quickly

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.080
which has finite resources

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.800
if you have a section of an economy

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.120
exponentially growing in a finite economy

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.240
eventually that group of society will own everything

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.640
and what that means is nobody else

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.360
including your kids including your grandkids

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.680
including your government will own anything

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.920
and I often use the metaphor of a cancer

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.320
because really what this is

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.520
is exactly a cancer what you have is a group of society

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.600
that is aggressively

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.680
when a cancer starts is very small right

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.040
but the problem with cancer is it grows very quickly

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.240
it grows at an exponential rate

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.280
so when it starts growing

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.600
it's growing but then it starts to grow super

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.120
super quickly and relatively quickly

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.560
it takes over the entire host and it destroys the host

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.240
and this is what the very rich will do in our society

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600
if untreated

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.320
so I think The Squeeze Out is a great video

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.200
The understanding the economy series is a great video

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.680
we'll link all of these in the comments

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.320
 I also think the

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.560
if you want like a really short one

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.520
I think the interview I did

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.640
with Krishnan Guru Murphy

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.360
at Channel 4 is another really good

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.800
like basic description 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.920
but really the whole

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.720
everything on this channel is about

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.880
trying to educate you very clearly

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.680
on these simple concepts these very

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.480
very simple concepts. If you do not deal

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.240
with the aggressive wealth growth of the very rich

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.760
their share will grow and grow in an exponential way

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.880
exponential growth gets out of control very

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.800
very quickly

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.200
it will rapidly displace

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.560
all of the other wealth in society

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.720
your governments will break down

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.520
because their wealth will be lost 

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.120
and the middle class

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.160
and the working class will also break down 

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.040
and that is why you need to deal with it

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.800
so understand this simple concept

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.240
and I think it's important to recognize

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.400
when you deal with this

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.640
we exist in a political climate where a big strategy

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.680
which the

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.120
the far right or the billionaires use against me

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.760
is they point at me and they say

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.480
Gary's a communist, Gary's on the far left

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.240
and they demonize anything that is considered left

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.920
so personally I don't think this is

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.560
a left wing idea my background is not in politics

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.440
my background is in economics

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.760
my background is trading

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.680
I use these ideas to make a lot of money

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.000
trading financial markets

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.720
 for me

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.920
this is like like car mechanics

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.680
you know a car mechanic looks at your car

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.640
he points out the problem

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.880
a doctor looks at your body you've got cancer

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.600
I'm an economist I can see what you have

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.960
the problem is a

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.720
rapid growth of wealth in this tiny little group 

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.440
this is not a left wing idea

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.160
this is a do you want your kids to be poor idea

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.640
and I think that is an important

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.000
starting ground to work from

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.840
just make it really really clear

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.040
communicate to people that

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.920
the way that this is often portrayed

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.880
as a kind of temporary recession

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.760
is increasingly obviously untrue

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.080
something else is happening

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.520
what is happening is aggressive wealth concentration

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.760
amongst the very rich

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.960
that is squeezing other groups out of society

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.040
what that means is wealth owning becomes impossible

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.560
for other groups in society

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.680
what that means practically

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.280
is your kids cannot have a house okay

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.200
and now we're moving on

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.880
I think to the the most common kickbacks

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.720
Alright so now I'm going to address some of the main

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.880
push backs against the idea that we need to tax

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.120
the very rich, that we need to tax wealth not work

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.680
 and I'm just gonna go through one after another 

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.320
most of these already covered before on the channel

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.600
but it's nice to have them all in one place

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.880
I think

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.480
and we keep getting asked the same questions again

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.280
and again

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.080
The most common push back we get by a million miles is

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.080
you can't tax them, if you tax them they'll leave and

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.160
what this misunderstands is and this is a very

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.960
very common criticism

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.800
what I do is a kind of sometimes intentional

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.400
sometimes accidental misunderstanding of

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.840
I'm trying to tax

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.040
people who own an enormous amount of wealth

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.720
I'm not trying to tax high earning individuals

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.440
that's why we chose to use the slogan tax wealth

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.240
not work we live in a tax system

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.880
which already taxes high earning individuals

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.680
very highly it does not tax extremely wealthy families

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.560
or individuals very highly at all

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.320
so working people are gonna be paying 50

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.520
60% maybe more if you include everything

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.400
whereas billionaires are often paying 0%

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.160
this is an absurd tax system

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.480
so we're not trying to tax

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.000
first thing is to make it very clear

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.160
we're not trying to tax working people in fact

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.200
we wanna reduce tax on working people

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.080
we're trying to tax the billionaires

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.200
the super super rich

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.640
and this is relevant to the idea of if you tax them

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.960
they leave because if you try and tax a working person

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.120
 like a doctor or a lawyer or a Youtuber

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.040
then that person can very often move to Dubai

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040
or move to Singapore

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.880
and they can do their job in the other country

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.680
they can pay tax in the other country

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.200
which might be at a lower rate

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800
they can avoid the tax

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.160
if we're talking about taxing billionaires

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.000
they don't make their money from their work

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.880
they get their money from owning assets

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.720
and assets means property

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.360
assets means land, assets means natural resources

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.120
assets means government debt

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.640
it means your mortgage

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.280
it means businesses that sell to the west

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.560
these guys they own largely property and debt

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.600
I think one way to think about it is if I have an asset

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.600
I get a passive income, where does that income come from

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.800
so if I own British businesses

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.440
it comes from British consumers

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.440
if I own British debt it comes from British mortgagees

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.320
people have mortgages, if I own British government debt

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.520
it comes from the British taxpayer

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.480
if I own British property

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.800
it comes from British renters

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.480
you know and the same is true all over the west

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.240
so if I own a ton of British assets

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.560
and I tried to move to Dubai

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.480
I'm still taking an enormous amount of cash flow

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.720
from British people

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.680
when they pay that passive income

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.680
so wealth holders can be taxed even if they leave

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.360
there's this absurd idea

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.280
oh my God, some people even start to mention

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.880
I think I'll do a brief segue here

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.280
because it's so ridiculous

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.120
some people start to mention

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.680
this idea of a Laffer Curve 

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.240
about taxing taxing wealth

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.840
and the idea of a Laffer curve is

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.040
if you tax people so much

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.560
they will eventually like avoid the tax

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.040
so if you really increase tax on work

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
people will stop working

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.200
or people will leave the country

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.200
but if you really

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.600
if you, first of all this Laffer Curve goes up and down

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.440
so it's supposed to hit a top at like 50%

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.000
we're trying to raise tax on wealth from 0% to 2%

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.640
which is definitely not 

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.080
a section which is downward sloping in this curve

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.680
how do you avoid a wealth tax

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.240
we're taxing ownership we're taxing hoarded wealth

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.000
the way that you avoid a tax on hoarded wealth

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.160
is you stop hoarding wealth

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.560
which is exactly what we want

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.440
we want the rich people to stop holding wealth

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.760
so that you can get your f**king wealth back

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.320
that's what we want, that is what we want

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.080
so we are not trying to tax working people

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.160
we are trying to cut tax on working people

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.000
we wanna attract productive people

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.640
productive businesses to the country

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.800
we wanna stop taxing ordinary working people like you

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.480
we wanna stop taxing ordinary working people

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.920
like your kids we wanna tax the super rich

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.240
let's talk about what happens

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.640
if you don't tax the super rich

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.280
if you don't tax the super rich

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.800
their wealth grows and grows

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.360
and grows and grows and grows

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.080
and other people in society like the middle class

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.120
like the government

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.080
see their wealth shrink and shrink and shrink

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.240
and shrink and shrink eventually

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.960
the government runs out of wealth

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.920
and has a choice between

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.560
shutting the welfare state down

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.080
taxing the rich or taxing the middle class

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.080
if you do not tax the rich

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.160
you will end up taxing the middle class

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.280
we here on this channel

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.640
are the people trying to protect the middle class

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.200
if you do not tax the rich

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.600
then the middle class will be next

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.040
and you are seeing this happen

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.480
we're gonna see this happen in the UK

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.920
in the budget this autumn

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.640
you are gonna see

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.680
because of the government's unwillingness

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.280
to tax the super rich that the middle class get taxed

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.400
you are seeing this at the moment with Donald Trump

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.160
in the US he is cutting tax on billionaires

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.280
and he is moving towards consumption taxes

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.680
which is tax on the middle class

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.480
Listen...

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.920
the billionaires are gonna try to tell you that

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.040
when I say tax the billionaires

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.840
I mean tax you at the same time

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.680
the billionaires are actively raising your taxes

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.720
if you want to protect your kids and your wealth

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.280
and your tax rates you need to protect yourselves

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.280
from the people who are going to take your wealth

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.560
which is the billionaires

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.560
now this is related to to the next point

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.800
which I'll just cover quickly

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.920
which is taxing rich people is really

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.120
really hard so we shouldn't do it 

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.920
I agree taxing rich people is is super super hard 

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.840
I think the main reason

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.320
taxing rich people is super hard

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.160
is because they have so much power

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.320
and influence over the media

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.360
and over politicians but I think we

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.560
we have a chance of doing it

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.000
and I think if we don't do it

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.400
then our economy will collapse

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.440
so I think it's worth

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.040
it's worth doing it to avoid our country collapsing 

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.400
listen, our grandparents

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.560
and our great grandparents lived in desperate poverty

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.160
and they fought hard to make things better

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.440
and they did make things better

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.840
if you don't fight hard to protect the working classes

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.000
the middle classes then you lose the middle class

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.160
and you lose your wealth 

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.800
just because something is difficult

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.640
that doesn't mean it's not worth doing 

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640
a country which refuses to do difficult

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.120
but essential things collapses, listen

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.360
curing cancer is difficult but if you had cancer

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.760
would you wanna try and cure it

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.760
or would you wanna just try and let it take control

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.560
it's worth doing

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.520
I'm gonna keep fighting so you should fight too okay

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.080
so the next argument against this

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.720
which is common is that it's not fair

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.120
it's not fair to tax rich people

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.840
rich people work so hard 

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.960
they they deserve all of the money that they get 

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.840
okay I just wanna make it clear

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.480
I'm not trying to tax working people 

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.920
I worked very hard, I paid 50

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.720
60%, at the same time

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.520
the Duke of Westminster inherited £10 billion and 

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.800
paid nothing 

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.240
I don't think that's very fair

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.160
we always campaign on tax wealth not work

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.800
Unless you are a billionaire

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.720
a super wealthy person we are trying to cut your taxes

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.240
listen if you wanna talk about fairness

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.040
if we do not do anything about this system

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.280
then very very quickly

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.160
the billionaires will own everything

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.320
and you will own nothing and we will move into a system

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.040
where all wealth is inherited

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.960
and it is impossible for ordinary people to own wealth

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.680
does that sound fair to you

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.040
but to be honest once again

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.920
I think this is a general 

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.040
a good general piece of advice

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.600
when you're talking about persuading people

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.440
personally I don't like to focus on fairness

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.040
 I like to focus on

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.600
real outcomes which is

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.560
if you don't deal

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.960
with this aggressive growth in wealth

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.280
of the very very rich

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.440
then what that means is

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.000
there will be no wealth holdings anywhere else

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.200
so whether you want fairness

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.080
or whether you want unfairness

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.480
you have a choice, do you want untaxed billionaires

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.960
or do you want your grandkids to own property

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.560
you cannot have both

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.840
you cannot have everything being owned by a minority

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.520
and things being owned by the majority

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.160
you have to choose either you tax the billionaires

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.400
or you accept poverty for your grandkids

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.080
So the last criticism we often get

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.440
and I think it's been pretty well covered now

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.680
is the misunderstanding that

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.280
I'm trying to tax working people

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.000
I'm not

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.640
I'm trying to cut your taxes

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.600
I'm trying to cut tax on working people

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.680
 if you do not tax the billionaires

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.360
we will reach a situation

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.680
where the billionaires end up taxing you

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.880
that's happening now in the US

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.080
it's happening now in the UK

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.400
tax wealth not work

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.360
we are the people who are protecting the middle class

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.680
if you are in the middle class

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.200
you should be on our side,  support us

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.680
we're not trying to tax working people

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.640
we're trying to tax the super rich, look

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.280
this is if you do not tax the billionaires

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.960
then in your country just like in my country

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.440
you will reach a situation

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.120
where the only way to not shut the welfare state down

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.920
is to raise taxes on the middle class okay

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.360
we're gonna do it here

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.720
it's gonna happen in your country

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.520
it is happening now in the United States

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.840
this increase in tariffs is a tax on consumption

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.800
consumption taxes are regressive taxes

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.200
which are paid disproportionately by the middle class

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.400
we are already in this situation

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
the billionaires

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.440
in an attempt to protect themselves from taxes

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.800
are gonna raise your taxes

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.960
we are the group that is saying

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.920
cut taxes on working people

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.880
the billionaires

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.480
are constantly trying to tell you that

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.880
we are trying to raise your taxes

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.560
we're not

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.480
they're the guys doing it, tax wealth not work

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.280
reduce tax on working people.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.000
Okay the next

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.720
and I think the last common criticism that we'll get

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.440
and I will say

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.200
if there are other criticisms you often get

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.800
stick them in the comments and 

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600
we will address them in another follow up video

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.080
I guess the last one I get is like

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.040
don't give money to the government

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.360
if you give money to the government

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.720
they'll waste it 

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.040
governments have been basically

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.760
rapidly shut down in every country in the world

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.200
including this country 

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.520
but I never said give your money to the government

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.400
what I'm doing is not about increasing government

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.120
it is not about increasing the tax take

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.560
what I'm trying to do

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.640
is protect you from aggressively growing

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.080
billionaire wealth I'm trying to change who pays taxes

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.880
at the moment

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.520
we have a situation where the super rich pay nothing

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.240
they grow their wealth massively

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.840
they squeeze out you and your family

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.200
while you and your family pay 40

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.160
50, 60% it's absurd

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.960
I'm not trying to give more money to the government

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.560
I'm trying to give more money to you and your family

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.960
I'm trying to protect your wealth

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.840
this is not about increasing government

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.480
I'm not a communist, I am the only person here

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.280
who is gonna give your kids a chance to own a home

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.000
Okay so to conclude

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.600
the situation that we're in is big and it's scary

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.880
the economic situation is gonna worsen really

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.200
really quickly, people are scared man

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.400
people are scared and people are right to be scared

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.240
it's important to understand that

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.480
when people are scared

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.960
and they see their family situation deteriorating

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.720
and they don't understand why

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.600
there's a very understandable instinctive

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.080
reflexive response

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.280
which is I wanna find the most powerful person I can

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.320
and I wanna try to get them to protect me

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.520
and if you look throughout history

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.280
you will see time and time and again

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.280
at times of serious economic deterioration

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.000
people vote for a strong man dictators

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.440
that's gonna happen now

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.480
that is gonna happen now because people are scared

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.000
in my opinion

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.200
the way to deal with fear is understanding

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.400
if people understand the situation

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.400
and how to respond to the situation

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.400
then they can act in a meaningful way

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.680
to protect their interests

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.240
while people are scared they're gonna rush to

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.160
kind of beg the protection of the billionaires

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.280
and they're gonna end up trying to be protected

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.320
by the exact people who are gonna eat their kids

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.480
so let's educate let's make things clear

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.320
let's make things clear to the public

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.400
what is happening is wealth inequality is increasing

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.840
that means the share that used to be held by you

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.360
by ordinary families by ordinary governments

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400
is disappearing and is being held by the super rich

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.560
if you take that back you can own wealth

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.240
and you can have a good standard of living

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.720
if you don't take that back

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.600
the situation will worsen

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.280
it will grow, it will accelerate like a cancer

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.960
and your kids will live in poverty

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.040
the way to protect yourself

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.160
is to raise taxes on the super rich

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160
so that wealth

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.440
can start flowing back to ordinary families

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.240
like yours

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.240
I know it's a lot to take in

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.200
when I first started

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.040
understanding that the economy was gonna collapse

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.800
back in 2011 I kind of had a mental breakdown

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.400
so I know like it's a big deal

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.080
but you don't have time to have a mental breakdown

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.760
right now you need to protect your kids

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.040
you need to protect your grandkids

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.960
and the way to do that is to understand the problem

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.760
and to educate your friends and your family

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.600
listen there is a massive space in politics

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.840
we can fill it. If we don't fill it

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.080
it's gonna get filled by some pretty bad guys

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.240
so support us, support the channel

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.200
understand, educate your friends

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.160
educate your family. Tax wealth

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.800
not work. Thank you very much
