00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.280
It's like suddenly

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.880
saying, "Okay, I have this

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.280
45-year-old son who's

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.560
not doing very well.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.240
I'm going to

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.480
protect him." Yeah?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.080
Yeah, okay.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.920
We have in the news

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.360
today-

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.160
today is, what

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.560
is it called?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.080
Freedom Day?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.560
Liberation Day

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560
Liberation Day.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560
Today's the day that...

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.160
The cheek of it, yeah.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, today's the day that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.280
Donald Trump is trying to

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.440
impose a lot of tariffs.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.840
So I know you talk a lot

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.560
in your work about how

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.080
poor countries

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.640
become rich.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.360
It's a really

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.680
interesting topic

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.000
because really, not a lot

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.600
of poor countries have

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.440
successfully become rich-

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.360
in the last 70 years,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.600
and Korea is probably,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.040
like, one of the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.760
outstanding examples

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.240
of one that has done.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.360
And correct me if

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.160
I'm wrong, but from my

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.960
understanding of your

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.280
work, you speak a lot

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.320
about how actually,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.040
a lot of the countries

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.760
which did become rich,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.800
not just Korea, but also

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.720
including the United

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.560
States in its history and,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.440
and the United Kingdom-

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.720
Mm-hmm.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.600
... used things like

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400
tariffs and things

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.120
like protectionism.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.800
Yeah.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.760
So I guess I couldn't

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.360
really have you on

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.320
today- on Trump's Tariff

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.480
Day, without asking you

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.960
what you think about

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.080
tariffs as a concept-

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.720
what you think about

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.040
Trump's tariff plans.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.360
Mm-hmm.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.720
Where do you

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.160
think they... will

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.360
they improve living

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.280
standards for Americans?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.640
Well, first of all,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.960
tariffs, like all

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.840
other policy tools,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.400
can be used for good, used

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.960
for bad purposes.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.680
Yeah.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.000
So that, you know, there

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.080
is no tool that is,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.520
universally good

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.480
or universally bad.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.680
Yeah.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.080
So that it all depends

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.280
on why you are using it,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280
how you are using it, yeah?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.400
So that the most

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920
successful use of a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.880
tariff is based on

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080
this idea of infant

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.160
industry protection.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.200
Yeah.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.120
So that ideas

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.960
are basically that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.200
the governments

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.800
of economically

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.600
backward nations

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.040
need to protect and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.480
nurture their industries,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.760
through tariffs, but

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.160
also other means like,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.000
subsidies and so on,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.520
so that they can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600
grow up and compete

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480
with superior foreign

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.880
firms eventually.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240
But while they develop,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.080
they need to be protected.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.880
And, you know, the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.800
hint is in the name.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.440
I mean, it's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
based on the idea

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.680
of child rearing.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.120
Yeah.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.520
Yeah.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.320
I mean, in the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.720
same way that

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.320
you could send your

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.760
kids to work at the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.880
age of five or six as-

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.120
Yeah.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.400
... the Victorians did

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.880
Many people did in history.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.320
Yeah.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720
And that today many

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.000
countries are still doing,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080
many poor countries.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.640
And that will, in the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.920
short run, save you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.960
money because you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.400
don't have to pay

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880
for the kids'

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.080
education, food, you know-

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.280
accommodation.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.240
he will,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.720
support himself, you know?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.680
But this will mean

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.720
that, that this

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.200
guy can never become,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.840
I don't know, nuclear

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.800
physicist or, economist

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.520
economist, yeah.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.320
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.040
God forbid.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.680
Yeah.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.360
Architect, yeah.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360
He cannot become a high

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600
productivity person, if

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.920
he doesn't go to school,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.280
go to eventually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
hopefully university.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.200
Yeah.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.960
So that you need to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.200
send the kid

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.680
to school until it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.160
kind of grows up-

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.400
Yeah.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.720
and then that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.880
push it into

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.480
the other labour market.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.680
Yeah.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.080
And, yeah, country after

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.560
country has succeeded

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.000
with this scheme and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Britain, in

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.080
the 18th and early 19th

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.880
century was still

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.480
not the leading

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.720
technological,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.640
nation in Europe,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.160
because at the time,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.800
Belgium, the Netherlands,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
parts of Italy were

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.880
ahead of Britain

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.560
in terms of technology.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.880
Britain used protective

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.920
measures to grow its

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.320
domestic industries

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.800
in the 19th century and,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.880
until the, really

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080
Second World War.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.560
The US had very high

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.520
tariffs, you know, 40, 50%.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.040
Yeah.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.480
So Trump tariff is

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480
nothing compared to that

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.320
because that, at the time,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.080
the US was, basically,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.240
struggling against

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.320
British and other

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.520
European competition.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.880
Yeah.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.280
And this is idea th-

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.360
... which was actually

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.440
formalised by the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.200
first finance minister

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000
called the... they call

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.240
it the Treasury Secretary

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240
in the country of the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.760
United States of America.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.080
Yeah.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.280
Alexander Hamilton, the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.680
guy on the $10 bill.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.080
Yeah.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.480
The guy who's

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.400
life has been made

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.720
into a hip hop musical.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.200
Yeah.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200
Yeah.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.280
So that this idea

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.360
has enabled many

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.640
nations, later, Germany,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.880
Sweden, France,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.960
Japan, Korea-

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.000
Yeah.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.680
Taiwan-

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.800
Yeah.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360
all used this idea to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.080
develop the industries.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.480
to protect your-

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.800
Exactly.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.000
young industries?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.600
But what Trump is

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.400
doing is, is not that.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.080
Exactly, yeah.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.440
Yeah.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.520
So it's like,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.800
suddenly saying,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800
"Okay, I have this

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.440
45-year-old son who's

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.680
not doing very well."

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.360
"I'm going to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.960
protect him."

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.760
Yeah.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.160
Okay.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.040
This is

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.680
nonsensical, yeah?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.960
Yeah.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.240
It is,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.000
Also, you know, he seems

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.440
to think that, by using

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.920
tariff, you can make

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.200
other countries come

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.640
and invest in the US-

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.680
Yeah.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.440
And I mean, yeah, it's

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.560
something that

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.000
has happened many, many

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.080
times in the past,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.200
many developing countries

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.440
put up high tariff wall-

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.400
but, kind of,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.920
that was partly

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.480
to encourage their

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.360
domestic producers.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.800
But also,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.360
to motivate

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.760
foreign companies to come

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.120
and set up factories.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.080
So for example,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.400
Brazil had a very high

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.240
protection against

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.680
foreign car imports

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.800
in the 1960s and '70s.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.360
So Fiat, Ford, these

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.720
guys came and

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.360
built cars in Brazil, yeah?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.640
Yeah.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.760
So that isn't known

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.200
as tariff jumping.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.000
So that Trump's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.040
hope is that if

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.280
I set up this tariff

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.400
wall, Korean companies,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040
Japanese companies,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.280
the German companies

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.040
are going to come and

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.920
produce their electric

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.240
cars and semiconductors

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.240
and... Yeah, some of it is

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.480
going to happen, but the

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.720
trouble is that this

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.240
is not going to be

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.120
even near enough

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.600
for the, well, what's

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.960
this expression, 'Making

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.280
America Great', you know?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.840
Yeah.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.440
And of course it will

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.600
raise the costs of-

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.000
Exactly.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.640
Yeah.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.080
So first of all,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.360
you cannot kind of

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.880
rebuild these

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.000
industries by simply

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160
having one factory here,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.360
one factory there, because,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.040
you know, in order

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.120
to have really high

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.480
productivity, you need

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.640
not just the factory

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.880
making the final product,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.960
but a whole kind of

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.320
industrial ecosystem as

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.240
economists call it.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.800
So you need workers

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.320
with the right skills,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.560
infrastructure that is

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.600
suited to the industry,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.320
even the university, the

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.400
departments are doing-

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.560
research in the area

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.640
that you are

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.400
specialising in.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.360
So unless you have

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.920
this tissue of

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.560
support system,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600
you're not going to

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.200
achieve high productivity.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.240
But, secondly

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.200
the most... something

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.280
that most people don't

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.200
even realise is that the

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.560
US financial system is

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560
now so parasitic that

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.880
it's not going

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.480
to allow Mr.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.760
Trump's plan to work

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.360
because, you know, the idea

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.440
is that when you give

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.320
protection, your domestic

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.960
companies will not only

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.200
have the protection

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.560
from foreign competition,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.440
but also have

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.800
extra resources.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.000
Yeah.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.120
Because

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.520
they can charge more.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.360
Yeah.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.320
And the hope is that

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.480
they'll use that

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240
resource to invest in

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.440
raising productivity,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.400
which is what happened

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.040
in Japan, Korea, yeah.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.360
Now, the US

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.440
financial system

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.000
is actually going to

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.080
drain this extra resource

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.440
from these companies

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.240
and make, the

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.080
income inequality

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080
even worse, yeah?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.280
So, yeah, because

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.200
in the last 25 years,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.840
American, top

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.800
American corporations

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000
have given away

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.360
something like 90 to

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.360
95% of their profits

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.720
to shareholders

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.120
through dividends and

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.360
more importantly,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.040
stock buybacks, yeah?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.280
Yeah.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280
So, you give

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.440
extra resources to

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.200
these companies, are

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.080
they going to invest?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.320
No.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.080
Their shareholders

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.480
will say, "Do more

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
stock buybacks, " yeah?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:31.640
Yeah.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.800
So you think it's gonna

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.360
lead to higher inequality?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.680
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.720
On top of that, we'll

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.400
have until you,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.360
kind of, build at

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.440
least some additional

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.920
industrial base, you are

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.960
going to have a serious

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.200
inflation problem, yeah?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.800
Yeah.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.320
I think it's also-

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.960
So this is

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.920
politically

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.880
unsustainable, no?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.760
It's gonna be... It's

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.280
gonna make life

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.040
harder for poor people.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.560
Yeah.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.160
Exactly, yeah.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.480
So

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.240
inflation, increasing

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.440
inequality,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.480
and, you know, seriously, I

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.920
mean, you cannot rebuild

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.080
an industrial base

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.360
that had been eroded

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.920
for the last 40 years

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.520
within two,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.360
three years, yeah?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.040
It will take at least,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.280
a couple of decades, yeah?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.520
Yeah.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.640
And these v- these

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.800
very, very broad tariffs

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.000
on almost everything.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.400
Exactly.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.520
Yeah.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.160
It seems, uh...

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.560
That's right.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:14.640
Yeah.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:14.920
I mean, ,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.760
It seems unwise

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:15.960
Yeah.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.160
If a tariff is

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.000
going to work, it has

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.520
to be targeted, yeah?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.640
Do you want to develop

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.680
automobile industry?

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:21.920
Yes.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.000
Protect automobile

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.600
industry but

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.240
then making sure...

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.960
And then you can make sure you have

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.920
the workers for the industry...

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.000
Exactly.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.040
Yeah.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.240
Yeah.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.080
There's no plan like that.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.520
Yeah.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:29.880
So...

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.160
So we don't think we're

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.840
gonna see an improvement

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.640
in living standards?

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.360
No, no, no.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:33.840
No, no.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.880
Neither do I

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.080
Yeah.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.720
But, hopefully it

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.400
won't be that bad.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.240
But, yeah.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.920
Pessimistic.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.240
Oh

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.880
Pessimistic

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.320
Yeah, I'm very pessimistic.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.560
But, you know, one

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.520
good thing about

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.440
Trump is that he

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.080
has no ideology, yeah?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.960
If it doesn't work,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.640
he will change

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.880
his mind.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.040
Yeah.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040
I do wonder... well, I

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.480
said this on the

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.240
channel before.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.760
it's very hard to

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.560
guess from what Trump

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.040
says what Trump actually

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.680
is gonna do.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.120
That's right

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.720
So, we hope he'll

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.360
roll back on this

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.960
because I think it would

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.520
be bad for everyone,
