00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.040
We have to do it about energy prices Sim&nbsp;

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.560
it has to be about energy prices

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.880
We were gonna do a video about something
else today but we have to do it on energy prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.000
because massive things are happening that&nbsp;
are going to affect you and your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.360
and you need to understand what's going on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.720
in the last couple of months you'll probably be&nbsp;
aware there have been significant increases in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.320
energy and food prices in the last couple of weeks&nbsp;
with the escalating crisis in Ukraine there's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.280
significant further increases in those prices&nbsp;
i woke up this morning and i saw the oil price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.040
had hit $140 a barrel for the first time in more&nbsp;
than 10 years the wheat price has increased 45%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.280
just this week and 65% this month you are not&nbsp;
seeing these prices in your bills or the shops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.640
yet but you are going to, what that means is on&nbsp;
top of the already significant increases in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.200
cost of basic living - bills &amp; food prices&nbsp;
are going to increase significantly more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.600
this is going to cost an ordinary family&nbsp;
like yours thousands of pounds a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.160
in many cases this will be thousands of&nbsp;
pounds a year that that family doesn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.640
that means a large number of families in this&nbsp;
country will not be able to heat their homes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.160
feed their kids to pay their mortgages to pay&nbsp;
their rent people are going to become homeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.360
millions of people are going to be&nbsp;
in these kinds of situations here

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.120
we have to do something about it, the media&nbsp;
and economists are presenting this like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.400
it's an unavoidable consequence of what's&nbsp;
happening in Ukraine like nothing can be done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.800
here are some facts you need to know
the average&nbsp;billionaire in this country increased&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.080
their wealth by Â£630million during Covid&nbsp;
the first year of Covid saw the biggest ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.400
increase in billionaire and millionaire wealth&nbsp;
ever in the history of this country&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.440
billionaire &amp; millionaire wealth increased by 22%&nbsp;
in just 1 year, ok, this is not a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.800
everybody's suffering this is a situation where&nbsp;
you and your family are suffering but billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.680
and millionaires have never ever made more money&nbsp;
in the history of this country okay so when people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.200
tell you there's nothing that can be done to&nbsp;
help your family pay the bills and heat your home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.520
i want you to realize make sure you're&nbsp;
aware and the people you know are aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.040
there has never been more money in the bank&nbsp;
accounts of the rich and the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.200
this is not a force of nature&nbsp;
this is a political choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.520
okay now for the economics bit, who uses the&nbsp;
most energy? rich people have got bigger houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.600
bigger cars and take more flights, in the extreme&nbsp;
cases, they've got luxury yachts and private jets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.600
they use the most energy, so when energy prices&nbsp;
go up, it should hurt them the most right? wrong!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.520
rich people might use 10 times as much energy as&nbsp;
you but they'll have 100 times as much income and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.480
500 times as much wealth so as a fraction of their&nbsp;
income and their wealth the amount they spend on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.760
energy and food is basically nothing if we look&nbsp;
at disposable income the situation is even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.960
extreme right disposable income is your income&nbsp;
after you take away rent, food, mortgage, bills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.520
a lot of ordinary families have nothing left&nbsp;
that means they have nothing with which to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.880
this extra two-three thousand pounds a year listen&nbsp;
the rich are generally sitting on half a million&nbsp;pound &nbsp;

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.480
a million pound disposable income if their&nbsp;
bills go up ten thousand pound it's not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.320
hurt them at all whereas for ordinary families&nbsp;
they're going to be left with nothing to eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.960
when you hear energy prices going up i want you to&nbsp;
understand this is a tax on the poorest in&nbsp;society

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.280
poor and ordinary families are going to&nbsp;pay where
as rich families are not even going to&nbsp;notice

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.560
this way of dealing with the crisis 
hurts&nbsp;ordinary families the worst

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.440
so how should we deal with this? 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.120
so how should wedeal with this? 
we need to use less energy most&nbsp;
families are using just about as much energy as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.520
they need to heat their homes and get themselves&nbsp;
to work and back whereas the super rich are often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.840
using way more energy than they need the
sensible&nbsp;way to deal with this crisis would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.400
to ask the rich and the super rich to reduce their&nbsp;
energy consumption but when prices go up&nbsp;that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.160
doesn't affect the rich's behaviour at all they can&nbsp;
easily afford that it will be ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.360
forced to reduce their energy
consumption&nbsp;by not heating their home

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.800
now economists have been&nbsp;saying for a long time
that the best way to reduce&nbsp;energy consumption

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.400
is to put a tax on energy use,&nbsp;the problem with this
is, as we're seeing in&nbsp;this crisis poor and ordinary

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.760
people spend&nbsp;a much higher % of their income &amp;&nbsp;
disposable income on energy than richer people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.400
so if you tax energy use it pushes the price&nbsp;
of energy up like we're seeing now and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.560
massively hurts poor and ordinary families&nbsp;
and does nothing for the rich and super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.680
so is there a better solution how about instead&nbsp;
of taxing people for using energy such that poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.880
people lose a big chunk of their disposable income&nbsp;
we start rewarding people who use less than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.840
average amount of energy that would mean that the&nbsp;
majority of families who use less than the average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.440
would start receiving money every year for the&nbsp;
energy that they save this way the rich who use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.480
the most energy would be paying money to poor&nbsp;
and ordinary people instead of punishing poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.280
and ordinary people for something they did nothing&nbsp;
to cause we can actually reward poor and ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.880
people for using less energy, look this&nbsp;
isn't just an idea that I made up, this is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.920
idea called the carbon dividend and it's been&nbsp;
around for a long time it's a very simple way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.600
of reducing energy consumption in such a way that&nbsp;
instead of punishing the poor you transfer wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.240
from the rich and the super rich who can afford&nbsp;
to pay it towards the poor and ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.840
who are often struggling just to survive it's&nbsp;
very simple you can reduce energy consumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.520
on the back of the rich but we're choosing to do&nbsp;
it on the back of the poor why are we doing that?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.720
you know i'm not sure to be honest i'm not&nbsp;
sure why we're not doing that and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.680
Rishi Sunak who is worth an estimated 200&nbsp;
million pounds and whose father-in-law is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.280
a billionaire or one of his people can get in&nbsp;
touch with me and explain why we're choosing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.920
to load this crisis on the back of ordinary people&nbsp;
instead of taxing millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.280
but in the meantime i'm going to have to assume&nbsp;
that Rishi Sunak and the current government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.440
do not have your best interests at heart&nbsp;
so what is the government actually doing?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.040
they're gonna have to do something and they're&nbsp;
gonna throw a few schemes together to give a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.800
families a couple of hundred pounds, bear in mind&nbsp;
you are losing thousands of pounds during this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:39.280
crisis and the super rich are making millions, are&nbsp;
they raising taxes on the super rich? well actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.080
they're raising national insurance which&nbsp;
is a tax which specifically hits your wages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.000
and specifically excludes the incomes&nbsp;
of millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.400
listen what's happening here is serious it's&nbsp;
not funny it's going to hurt millions of poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.360
and ordinary families yeah ordinary people&nbsp;
like you are going to suffer in this crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.160
while the rich and the super rich are&nbsp;
making millions even billions of pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.480
it doesn't have to be that way the money&nbsp;
is there we can support ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.920
but only if we choose to tax the rich and the&nbsp;
super rich but they're not going to give it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.840
us easy we're only going to get that
if we&nbsp;come together and push back

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.840
keep watching

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.760
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.080
many more options in how we live our lives, some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:51.600
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy - that is not true!
