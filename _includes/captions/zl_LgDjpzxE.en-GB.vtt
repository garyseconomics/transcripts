00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.240
Okay so this week

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.200
we are going to have our first interview

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.720
for this series

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
and our first ever interview with a politician

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.160
on Gary's Economics.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.040
You might remember earlier in the year

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.360
I spoke about being approached by Labour

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.400
to have politicians on the channel and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.200
we eventually chose not to do it for now

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.560
largely because

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.640
we need to play a little bit of a game with Labour

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.000
for sort of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
using what we can to get some influence over them

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.920
but also really to be totally honest

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.760
one of the reasons we chose not to have politicians

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.480
was because I thought most politicians

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.480
when they go on TV

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.440
when they go on the radio are incredibly boring

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.680
they just say their own sort of pat lines

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.360
you can tell that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.040
they're just saying what they're supposed to say

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.640
and I thought it would be terrible

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.440
YouTube basically

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.680
but I got contacted by a politician

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200
from another country recently

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.200
she reached out to me on Instagram and I was so busy

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.120
I forgot to reply and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.520
then last week

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.840
I suddenly start getting loads of messages

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.560
through loads of channels

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.400
from this politician who was saying “listen

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.320
I'm an MP in New Zealand

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.880
I'm really supportive of wealth taxes

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.920
I love the work that you do and I'm here in London

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.160
so like please find the time to meet me”.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.680
So I researched a little bit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480
and I saw that there was

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.080
this co leader of the New Zealand Greens

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.440
who's been massively supporting wealth

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.360
taxes for a long time

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320
I went out and met with her last weekend and she seemed

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.640
if I can say honestly like somebody who was not boring

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.560
and could talk honestly

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.400
and was a little bit thoughtful

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600
about what was happening.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.240
We're here in this space now

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
where the channel’s growing a lot

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760
and we're starting to figure out,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.320
we'll try and figure out how to influence politicians

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.760
how to get involved in politics

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
how to actually make wealth taxes happen.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.320
So I met with her last weekend and I said

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.880
you know what

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.800
you seem like a politician who can actually speak

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.960
is actually cool

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.360
you've flown thousands of miles to be here

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.520
we're shooting on Wednesday

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040
why don't you come around and shoot

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.840
so this week

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.400
our first ever politician on the channel

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.800
is gonna be an interview with

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.000
Chlöe Swarbrick

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.160
co leader of the New Zealand Greens.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.920
Alright so first of all

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.600
thank you for flying out here coming such a long way

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.840
thank you very much for coming on the channel

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.080
it's a pleasure to meet you

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.280
some of our viewers won't know who you are

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.560
would you be happy to introduce yourself a little bit?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.440
Yeah for sure

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.280
My name is Chlöe Swarbrick

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.400
I've been involved in politics since I was 23 years old

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.800
I guess the long and short of it is that I raged

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
so hard against the machine

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680
I somehow ended up inside of it.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.720
I'm now 31 years old 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.600
and was elected in 2017 as a List MP

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.800
so we have something called mixed member proportional

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.000
so proportional representation in Aotearoa

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.200
New Zealand and then in 2020

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.880
I became the MP for Auckland Central

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.160
which is the centre of our largest city

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.960
which is a city of approximately one and a half,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.400
two million people.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.560
Okay so what made you...

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.320
when you first became an MP, is that the right term?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.400
You were, how old were you? 23.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.640
So what made you so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120
like, keen to get in at such a young age?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.440
I was so angry man

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.880
What were you angry about?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.040
hahaha so I had spent

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.920
four and a half years on this little radio station

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.480
called 95BFM

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.640
number one alternative radio station in Auckland

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.560
and I've been interviewing these politicians

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.200
and community leaders and researchers and academics

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.600
and I'd never really understood why

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.400
all of the people who had dedicated their lives

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.480
to solving these problems

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.360
were saying one thing

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.080
and the politicians were saying the other

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.720
and in 2016 the local body elections were coming up

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.800
and I was interviewing the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.080
kind of top four candidates for the Auckland mayoralty

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.080
as prescribed by the mainstream media

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.840
and I'm a born and bred Aucklander

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.560
we've got a lot of problems as a city

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.720
but as far as I

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.560
was concerned they were our problems

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.680
and we had to kind of stay and fight and fix them

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040
and we're experiencing the brain drain

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.680
at that time, a lot of my mates were leaving the country

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.480
for you know, greener pastures

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.680
for lower cost of living

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.520
for better job opportunities and god forbid

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.120
functional public transport and a decent nightlife

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.720
I was complaining about it to my good mate

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.240
and producer at the time and she was like

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.880
shut up Chloe

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880
go and do something about it

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.200
so I googled how to become the mayor of Auckland

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.920
I found you had to be over the age of 18

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.680
had to pay 200 bucks for administrative fees

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.400
and had to have two people nominate you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.800
so I was like, okay cool

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.720
I had absolutely no political experience

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.000
no idea what the hell I was doing

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.840
had never been involved in a political party

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.320
I put myself forwards

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.320
and just had this really basic thesis

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.840
or idea

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.160
I guess that god forbid we put ideas on the table and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.600
you know regular people engage with those ideas

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.040
and we work together to try and make things better

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.960
and obviously I was so young at the time

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a lot of people would go at me because of my age

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.600
and I'd kind of go, well

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.200
very clearly any politician that stands in front of you

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.520
and tells you that they know everything

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.440
regardless of their age is either lying

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.640
to you or completely lacking self awareness

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.440
and I'm not sure which of those is worse

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.440
so I'm never pretending to have all of the answers

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.040
but I'll be crystal clear about what I believe in

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.720
and wanna work with the experts

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.920
and the people who do know what the answers are

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920
and let's just try and make something of that

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.360
you know?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.240
So I wanna talk to you a little bit about politics

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.600
because

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.320
obviously this is a YouTube channel

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.080
primarily about economics and inequality

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.800
but in the last like one year

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.400
two years we've grown a lot

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.200
and it's reached the point where

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.240
I feel we need to start

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.440
basically trying to influence politics

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.720
we've got a new government that's been in for one year

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.320
which is Labour, our centre left

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.280
party who

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.320
you would imagine

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840
should be doing something about inequality

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.440
should in theory be open to wealth taxes, but

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.920
they haven't really given us much.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.000
So I wanna know a little bit about

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.640
your experience in politics and how

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.680
if you can sort of give us any advice

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.560
how we can influence politics and politicians

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.800
because we're at that sort of level

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.600
but before we talk about that

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.200
I wanna talk a little bit about

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.040
New Zealand and the economy in New Zealand

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.560
because it's a long way away

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.840
most of our, well actually it's quite international now

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.560
but most of our viewers are UK,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.000
US, Europe

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.920
they might not know that much about New Zealand

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.120
you know, other than Lord of the Rings

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.640
this kind of stuff so

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.600
could you give us like, summarise

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.480
what you think are the most

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.360
important things we should know about the country

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.920
the economy, the economic situation

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.360
just a few ideas

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.400
how you think it might be similar to what it's like

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.400
here in the UK, Europe

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.600
the US, how it might be different.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.280
Yeah for sure

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.840
so look

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.160
first thing I'll say is I love and adore my country

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.720
obviously I wouldn't do what I do if I didn't

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.880
and I think that we

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.360
like so many other countries

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.160
have an amazing pool of phenomenal people

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.600
who are incredibly hardworking

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.920
incredibly creative and incredibly talented

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.960
but the problem is, much like here

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120
they are stymied

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.600
or blocked from reaching their full potential

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.760
because of the way that the economy is rigged

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.480
in favour of those at the top.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.360
So to start unpacking that

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.120
we had some research

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.760
that was commissioned

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.240
actually by the former Labour government in 2023

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.760
from the Inland Revenue department

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.920
our tax department

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.480
and what that showed is that at that point in time

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.160
the wealthiest 311 households

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.560
had a combined wealth of approximately $85 billion

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.880
that was more than the bottom

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.760
two and a half million New Zealanders combined

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.920
bear in mind this is in a country

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.800
this is a country of five million people

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.480
so that kind of stratification of wealth right

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.440
was exposed not just to be kind of an accident or

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.920
you know something that just happened.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.440
It is a direct consequence

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.360
of what that report also exposed

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.360
which is that we have a tax system that says

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.400
those at the top pay an effective tax rate

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.680
less than half of that of the average New Zealander

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.160
and that goes to the core of what

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.840
you're always talking about

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.560
which is that those who are at the top

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.840
are able to arrange their finances in such a way

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.160
cause they have access to accountants and lawyers

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.240
and otherwise where wealth just kind of begets wealth

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.040
and it accumulates

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.920
cause they're able to sit on that pile of treasure

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.160
whereas regular

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.520
working people are paying income tax as they go

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.120
so this is resulting very clearly

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.240
in a backsliding of the quality of life

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.320
and a massive increase in the cost of living

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.280
for regular hard working people

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.880
and I think that really contradicts

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.800
the egalitarian ideas that we have

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.960
not only of other people

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.880
projecting onto Aotearoa, New Zealand

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.680
but also that we even have of ourselves

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.600
right? And I think that

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.880
you know, another really important point is that

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680
we are an outlier in the OECD

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760
as the only country in the OECD

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.320
that doesn't have a form of wealth tax,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.160
inheritance tax

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.400
or even a capital gains tax or stamp duty

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.640
None of any of those? None of those

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.840
and the political debate is so bloody constrained

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.840
it is so frustrating because

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.840
whenever we try to talk about fixing those scales right

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.120
there's this kind of appeal to like

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.720
in some ways

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.560
this imported notion of the American dream

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.760
or this bizarre reference back to how

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.520
you know

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.880
in our heads we're egalitarian

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.680
whereas very clearly an experience and evidence

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.120
we're not. 

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.080
So you, I mean I think

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.800
a lot of British people probably do have that kind of

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.720
perception of New Zealand

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.240
which is that it's more equal

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.480
perhaps that living standards are in some ways better

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.480
We've got a lot of nature!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.160
But it's interesting to hear then if you actually...

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160
from what you just described

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.200
the tax system of New Zealand is even worse

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.680
from an equality perspective

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.800
than the tax system of the UK

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.880
and my sort of big idea

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.160
which I always push here on this channel

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.520
is if you don't tax rich people

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.480
what will happen is

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.760
they will accumulate a lot of money very quickly

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.560
and they'll use that to buy the assets

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.880
and what you'll start seeing is house prices going up

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.560
housing becoming less affordable

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.400
So I went on the radio yesterday to like a call in

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.240
taking calls

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.920
actually on Tom Swarbrick’s show

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.880
another Swarbrick, two Swarbrick’s in two days

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.160
We're not related as far as I'm aware

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.920
And Tom said to me

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.520
this is like a quite well known radio host here

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.480
he said housing is more affordable in other countries

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.680
and I said where and

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.480
he didn't say New Zealand

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.040
but he said Australia so

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.680
you're coming here telling me that the tax

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.600
situation in New Zealand is even worse,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.080
what's the housing affordability situation?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.240
It's cooked mate

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.760
so on some metrics

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.400
we'd have

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.280
some of the most unaffordable housing in the world

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.240
and part of the reason that right now

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.920
house prices are stabilising

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.680
despite the current government's best efforts

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.280
with giving tax breaks out to landlords

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.320
and changing the bright line test by which

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.040
you know people end up paying taxes

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.080
we are now seeing a stabilising or a slight reduction

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.000
but that's despite the government's best efforts

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.520
so we've got quite a conservative government

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.840
at the moment

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.880
some economists have characterised our economy as

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.440
more of a housing market with bits tacked on the side

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.560
and I think that this kind of is

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.640
part and parcel of what we were talking about before

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.520
with how this kind of inequality compounds right

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.720
people are working so damn hard

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.040
so many regular people are working so damn hard

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.560
as house prices have escalated before their very eyes

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.760
over the last you know

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.120
few decades and now

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.840
regular people are having to rely on

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.320
what's colloquially known as the bank of mum and dad

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.600
in order to get into their first house

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.200
and that then kind of creates this cultural norm

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.600
where nobody wants to create a situation

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.640
where it seemed that housing would end up being taxed

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.440
so the problem continues to perpetuate

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.040
and we end up in this kind of parasitic feedback loop

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.520
which is squashing regular

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.240
hardworking people. This is really

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:23.720
I mean,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.400
it it reminds me so much of what's happening here

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.200
which is you have this situation where

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.280
because the rich are not taxed

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.960
they're accumulating all this money

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.840
and that

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.680
all that pushes house prices up in an obvious way

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.520
because they can

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.200
you are competing with them to buy the houses

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.000
you know they don't need to buy them themselves

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.520
they can just lend the money for the mortgages

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.200
if you have these guys who are sitting on the side

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.160
and they're gonna buy anything that has a return of

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.640
you know

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.840
just over 5% you know

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.680
unless the house price is above here

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.400
they're gonna buy it

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.360
so you have to pay this enormous amount

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.600
but then what you

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.840
what you get is this kind of perverse reaction

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.720
which is

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.280
because people know then that unless you own wealth

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.880
you're like totally screwed

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.800
they then become resistant to the taxation of wealth

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.760
and my big challenge here

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.960
is to try to communicate to people

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.720
if you don't tax the wealth of the very rich

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.680
you are the one who's gonna be squeezed out

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.280
you're not gonna beat them in that game

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.520
one of the reasons why I was keen to have you on is because

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.520
here in this country we get a lot of people

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.280
leave this country to go to Australia

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.440
to go to New Zealand

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.800
in this pursuit of better living standards

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.400
maybe more equal society maybe more affordable housing

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.160
and at the same time as British people say that to me like

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.840
like I told you this

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.560
I got told this on the radio yesterday

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.120
we get people in the comments all the time, Australia

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.320
New Zealand, Canada

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.520
saying even places like Sweden

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.760
oh my God it's so much worse

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.520
oh my God

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.720
it's so much worse here. So

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.040
I was keen to have you on

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.000
to perhaps communicate to British people, Europeans

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.160
Americans who are watching

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.280
this is not a problem that you can run away from

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.600
because it is a global problem

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.960
it's a worldwide phenomenon

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.280
Yeah and again

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.520
it's gonna require probably

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.080
if we're going to do wealth taxation properly

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.280
global coordination. Yeah.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.360
But again you know

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.960
as I think you frequently point to

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.600
it might be really hard to do

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.880
but it is the right thing to do

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.960
and it's the only thing, it's the

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.200
necessary thing for us to do

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.240
if we are to arrest this growing wealth inequality

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.880
and this is another thing that I think

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.840
it's really important for people to understand

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.880
is that poverty doesn't come from nowhere

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.600
it is directly caused by this tolerance of

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.400
that deep wealth inequality

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.160
and this is also where you know

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.200
for New Zealanders

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.520
and probably around the west of the world

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.760
to also understand that

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.600
instituting these wealth taxes

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.280
is not only about arresting that deeply

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.720
and quickly growing wealth inequality

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.360
but it's also about

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.880
bringing back into the collective pool

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.560
the resources necessary

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.640
to build the foundations of the society that all of us

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.760
bloody live in

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.240
which goes to the core of the myth of self made

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.640
This is the thing I always, 

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.120
I don't know if I've emphasized it enough

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.840
you know this is not

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.160
this is not inequality for inequality’s sake

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
this is if you allow that inequality to rise

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.000
what that also means is you losing your assets!

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.720
If the 1% owns 100%

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.680
what that means is you own nothing and

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.800
and you are being squeezed out

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.680
and this is the thing

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.880
which I'm constantly trying to think about

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.000
how do we communicate

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.920
but yeah I was I was keen to have you on talk

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.400
to show a little bit that this is not

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.560
sometimes people have people ask me

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.240
you know how can we do it in the UK alone

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.120
and what I always say is, why do it in the UK alone?

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.400
If you look at the time when inequality was reduced

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.960
after World War 2 it was a big international effort

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.840
so I was keen to have you on to show

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.640
there are people fighting this fight in other countries

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.280
and to be clear we'll get on to this next

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.040
you have been supporting wealth taxes

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.640
you know I want to have Gabriel Zukman

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.680
and Thomas Piketty on, two

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.560
of the French economists who've been pushing it

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.920
I was over in Norway

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.120
talking to Norwegian political parties

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.560
there are people all over doing this

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.320
but that brings us to the next question

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.160
if there are so many people in so many countries

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.000
fighting for wealth taxes

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.600
and you know, now in the UK

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.760
we see the polling

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.600
it's overwhelmingly popular with the public

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.240
what is stopping us from getting these?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.840
Because you know

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.640
you're a politician

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.320
you've been in there for a number of years

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.280
I'm sure you'll be seeing similar things

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.000
in your country

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.480
why is it that even centre left political parties

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.640
and you can speak

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.560
it's also called the Labour Party in New Zealand right?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.280
You can speak for what they've been doing

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.760
where is that resistance from

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.600
even these traditional centre left coming from and

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.600
what do we do and how do we overcome it?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.400
So I think there's a few different things at play

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.040
one is very much vested interests

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.400
so there are a lot of very wealthy people

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.920
who will do absolutely everything that they can

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.400
to fan the flames of fear

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.440
and to point to division and distraction

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200
and to create division and distraction

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.640
amongst regular people so that

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.160
you know here

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.920
for example it's migrants and our country

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.840
I mean definitely

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.200
the two more radical right wing parties

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.520
are currently falling over themselves

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.480
to take credit for a New Zealand values test

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.720
that they want to impose on migrants

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.920
as well but all of that aside

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.040
these very wealthy people own largely

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.360
but also influence hugely our media landscape

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.760
then I think you know

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.480
part and parcel of the unfortunate consequences of this

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.040
inequality

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.960
is not only that regular people are poorer and poorer

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.280
but also that they have less and less time

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.280
to engage with the political arena

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.160
this has happened simultaneously too

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.440
over the last 40 years

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.920
very intentional shredding of collective action

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.720
of union movements you know

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.400
people are living more precarious lives

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.080
so the gig economy for example

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.400
means that you're less likely to know your coworker

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.800
You’re less likely to know your neighbour

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.800
because you're less likely to be able to stay in your house

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.120
for a long period of time

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.320
what that means is that when we see these problems

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.120
impacting our day to day lives

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.880
we see them as problems with us

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.880
not as systemic problems necessarily

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880
so I think

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.480
it's also part and parcel of how people perceive

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.960
and understand the world. Then it's the media landscape

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.000
and the messages that we're getting

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.240
about what's actually possible

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.360
and feasible. People are intentionally

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.240
confused by, you know, again

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.840
all of these distractions and all of this division

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.320
and that then also bleeds into the vested interests

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.200
which influence our politics.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.680
So yeah I think that it really boils down

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.600
to put, to flip that on its head

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.960
what the solution looks like

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.880
is people understanding that

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.000
you know, these solutions are not gonna come from vested

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.760
interests very clearly

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.720
and it's gonna require an understanding that

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.960
politics is not as complicated as it's made out

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.000
in the same way that

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.240
economics is not as complicated as it's made out

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.440
you know, I've been in politics now

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.800
for the better part of 10 years

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.120
politics very simply is just about power

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.640
it's about resources

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.080
and it's about who gets to make decisions

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.600
that saturate and shape our daily lives, right?

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.680
That is politics.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.200
Things end up getting complicated

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.720
when we throw in all this partisanship

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.880
and these political parties

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.080
or whatever else

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.160
but I think some very clever people

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.080
likes of yourself have articulated

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.440
you know it is no longer this kind of simplistic

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.560
left or right wing thing

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.040
it very much is the 1% versus the 99%

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.320
and as you've also said before

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:12.720
you know

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.080
there's very wealthy people who are looking to protect

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.920
their lot or what they perceive is their lot

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.080
which I would actually argue

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.640
has come at the expense of everybody else

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.920
who's working and slogging their guts out.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.520
They are going to

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.720
do everything to have regular people believe

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.040
that they are not worthy

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.920
or they do not deserve a fairer society

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.640
and I think this just kind of leads us to the conclusion

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.800
why the hell would you let the people

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800
who are currently fleecing you

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.920
and laughing their way to the bank

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.200
tell you what is possible in politics

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.120
It’s cooked

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.760
Yeah, I have often used the term in the past

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.560
the fire engines are not coming.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.760
What I mean when I say that is

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.720
people, definitely people in this country

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.960
especially more working class people

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.440
have kind of had it drilled into them like

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.640
you know, it's not your place to deal with that

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.120
like that's the job of the politicians

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.080
Yeah, and that also

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.120
is I think another big problem, is

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.360
you've probably heard the adage,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.240
in relationships

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.080
that you get the love that you think that you deserve

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.880
so a lot of people

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.280
stay in a lot of really shitty relationships right?

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.600
I think the same goes

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.800
we get the politics that we think that we deserve

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.280
and after 40 odd years of politicians

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.360
promising one thing and then selling regular

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.200
hard working people down the river with

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.160
you know, everything that they actually do in reality

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.640
you know, this

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.040
the implications of that are that

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.520
people don't believe that politics

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.600
is capable of changing or transforming their lives

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.640
so you end up with this really negative feedback loop

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.080
whereby people don't get the outcomes that they want

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.680
from engaging in politics

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.680
so why would they engage?

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.120
That lack of engagement results in

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.480
a lack of representation on the things that they want

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.200
which then results in less action

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.120
less engagement

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.800
less representation and so on and so forth.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.640
So I've got this kind of strategy right

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.520
which I've been calling the Murdoch strategy

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.600
which is

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.480
you know, what does Rupert Murdoch do?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.840
You don't mind me speaking about Rupert Murdoch?

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.960
No go hard.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.520
He has a lot of control over the media

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.840
but I think that's slipping a little bit

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.040
because of the move towards social media

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.960
For those who don't know

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.200
this is the guy that owns like tons of like news channels

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.120
radio stations, newspapers

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.360
controls what the public think

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.000
and then because of that he can kind of

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.160
decide whether a

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.800
political party wins or loses an election

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640
and for that reason

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.760
the political parties kind of have to do what he says

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.240
right? And then I've seen this move towards social media

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.200
which I think has opened a lot of space

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.120
because a lot of the traditional

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.560
power players in politics

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.600
the political parties, the big media stations

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.480
including the ones owned by Rupert Murdoch have

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.640
not been quick enough to move into that space

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.880
and then that's meant that there's all of this kind of

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.040
power to take

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.760
in terms of influencing what the public believe

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.920
what the public understand on social media

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.960
and if we move in and take that

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.200
then we can educate the public and then

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.720
we can be trusted by the public

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.640
and then we can do what Murdoch has always done

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.000
which is go and have a meeting

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.400
with the political leaders

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.840
before the elections and say, ‘well

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.320
what are you gonna offer me?’ basically

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.400
But the stumbling block that I've come to

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:19.680
obviously

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.800
I'm not as big or as influential as Rupert Murdoch

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.000
but this channel is by the standards of like politics

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.160
social media it's massive now right?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.920
And we have a Labour Party

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.440
which is polling terribly badly

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.640
they look like they're gonna lose

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.160
really badly in the next election

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.400
This channel is very popular

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.880
and very influential with the British public

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.840
and yet

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.880
this phenomenally unpopular Labour Party are extremely

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.880
stubbornly resistant to listening to us

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.240
so as somebody who's been within politics

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.320
and I guess I know

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.360
you've been supportive of wealth taxes for a long time

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.640
maybe you've had similar experiences yourself

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.840
have you got any advice for

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.360
like what can we do

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.160
what should we do? Should we change our strategy

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.680
in trying to influence Labour

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.960
should we forget about Labour

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.320
and just go straight for the public

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.120
have you got any advice about what we should do?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.560
Oh mate

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.240
if I had advice to give you

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.320
we would have sorted out all our problems right?

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.880
But I think that this is

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.400
kind of exposing the fact that

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.880
I've been here now for a few

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.760
days and I've been meeting with some phenomenal people

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.960
likes of yourself and you know

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.800
some of your local politicians and economists and

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.400
you know I'm gonna meet with some more

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.000
the likes of Piketty and Zucman

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.200
and what I am learning

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.360
is that nobody has solved this problem

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.240
there is no clear answer

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.920
which leads me to the conclusion

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.720
that we have to get our bloody hands dirty

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.400
you know, I am part of so many conversations

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.080
with so many smart people

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.960
who paralyze themselves by falling over

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.640
needing to be right or having all of the perfect plans

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.520
before we just start moving on it

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.240
and I guess in the most simplistic way

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.360
there's kind of two broad spheres

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.600
that we can bring about change in

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.120
and they're very interconnected

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.640
the boundaries between them are really porous and open

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.360
and that's kind of

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.320
structure, so the structures of society are legislation

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.480
regulation, funding

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.280
taxation systems, the incentives, subsidies

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.120
trade agreements, treaties

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.680
procurement processes, contracts

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.080
etcetera. That's like the blueprint or the coat hooks

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.120
or the social contract

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.840
as it's written down in black and white

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.720
but that stuff gets its legitimacy from

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.240
and can be delegitimised by culture

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.760
and this is really important

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.640
cause culture here

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.520
I'm defining from a design thinking perspective

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.600
which is about a shared set of values

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.840
and when you understand our culture

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.320
as a shared set of values

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.400
you can come to understand

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.440
how we create this thing called society

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.720
which we all live in

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.080
with people from all of these different backgrounds

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.800
who come together to prioritize

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.120
whether it be implicitly not talking about it

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.080
or explicitly

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.800
intentionally working through that democratically

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.480
hopefully what those values actually are

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.920
so that's kind of the glue that binds society together

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.760
right? And if you think about the different leverage points

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.720
for changing culture, so therefore

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.720
creating the environment conducive to structural change

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.560
to changing politics, to changing our laws

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.080
to changing our tax system

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.720
it's things like media

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.280
which as you've just talked about

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.000
is being massively influenced

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.960
or undercut now by the social media landscape

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.240
it's things like education

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.840
which is really important

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.320
but it takes a really bloody long time

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.640
especially

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.080
if you do that through the compulsory education system

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320
but more fundamentally it's about community building

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.120
I think

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.520
and this is where we have to be honest with ourselves

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.960
about the really hard graft

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.240
that is obviously

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.640
the likes of petition and protest

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.360
but more than that, conversation

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.280
and regular people feeling confident

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.600
and capable enough to talk to each other

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.120
about what these problems are.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.880
Understand that they are shared problems

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.240
they're not our own individual problems

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.640
they're systemic problems

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.800
and then work together

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.160
organising to try and change that.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.040
So I guess you know

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.280
that's a roundabout way of providing the context

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.600
to answer your question which is that

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.680
if we are to get the critical mass necessary

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.000
to make this change politically

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.760
then we need more regular

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.880
people who know that they are just as bloody entitled

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.360
to have an opinion on something

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.720
to approach their politician

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.240
and to make a political impact

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.760
as the Rupert Murdochs of this world.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.800
Yeah this is pretty much in line with

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800
with what I've been saying

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.280
which is I think that

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.600
I think that there's a there's a lack of compelling

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.720
cohesive popular political messages at the moment

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.720
I think we've moved into a space of kind of broad

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.120
lack of faith of politicians

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.200
but I think that provides a lot of opportunity for like,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.520
individuals acting as amplifiers of a message

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.080
so like, the popularity of this channel

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.360
you know, we've never spent a penny on advertising

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.160
it's word of mouth right?

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.680
And I keep saying, you know

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.400
if everybody convinces one person

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.640
then you get everybody and

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.200
I do think there's huge space to grow that

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.200
through conversations. But on that topic

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.680
I can't talk to you today

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.240
without bringing up the subject of rising anti

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.000
immigrant sentiment

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.560
the increased popularity of the far right

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.440
There was a huge rally here this weekend

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.960
this weekend just gone, by the far right here in London

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.800
I think they have really in a sense

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.640
done a good job of spreading a message

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.480
through social media totally through people

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.520
through communities

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.320
and they tapped into real anger

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.440
Yeah, and when you talk about conversation

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.880
I worry a little bit

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.080
we're having... it's

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.080
making conversations more difficult

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.560
because

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.800
I feel that this country is moving a little bit more

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.960
towards the

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.360
kind of

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.560
very divided society that you see more so in the US

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.320
where you're either on one side or the other side

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.560
and people can't really talk

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.640
What's the situation like in New Zealand

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.880
do you have a rising far right

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.960
is it similar, are similar things happening

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.160
and what can we do about it?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.880
I mean I don't think

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.480
that would be remiss of me to say that

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.400
we've got

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.760
the most right wing government that we've had

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.080
in a generation and they are very intentionally

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.680
shredding the social safety net

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.200
so they put a hiring freeze in our healthcare system

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.520
which is you know

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.720
resulting in

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.000
people waiting hours and hours in emergency departments

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.720
our education system is

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.960
falling apart at the seams

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.080
and again none of this is for lack of the amazing

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.560
people in those systems really trying

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.400
but they're burning out

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.280
and many of them are then looking offshore

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.520
for better opportunities

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.280
better quality of life for them and their family

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.120
for lower cost of living

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.160
and all of those kinds of things

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.120
and this is also why I think

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.240
it's important that we're talking

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.120
and understanding that this is a global phenomenon

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.600
right? 

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.200
So while people might move to try and escape these issues

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.640
domestically they'll chase them because

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.080
you know, the billionaires are coming and

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.600
you know Peter Thiel

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.480
has citizenship in my country

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.240
and is building a bunker

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.400
it’s maddening. So I guess again

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.120
this is where we need to understand that

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.600
in terms of the political analysis

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.920
and this polarisation, tepid centrism

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.160
that is, you know

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.200
centre left parties have been bumbling along

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.000
and not meaningfully

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.520
addressing the material conditions

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.920
of regular working people

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.200
for the last 40 years. People are not stupid

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.600
they understand

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.160
that their day to day lives are deteriorating

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.240
that things are getting harder

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.000
that they are working longer

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.560
and they are angry about that

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.680
and they need somewhere to put that anger

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.200
and the kind of major proposition from

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.720
supposedly left wing parties

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.320
or centre left wing parties over the last 40 years

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320
and particularly the last 10 or so years

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.760
has effectively been tokenism

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.760
has been going well

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.680
we're gonna put one person from a structurally

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.560
marginalized community into a position of power

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.080
not change the power structures

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.480
not deal with any of the fundamental issues in society

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.560
but we're just gonna

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.000
kind of put a gloss on hyper capitalism

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.240
and this deeply entrenched inequality

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.520
and you know

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.720
I think that in turn has meant that

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.880
there is a space for the far right to kind of enter

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.680
and go, OK

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.120
well it's that person who's been placed into that

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.480
supposed position of power

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.280
this like historically structurally marginalized person

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.480
well they're the problem

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.080
you know

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.400
it's the gays or the migrants or whatever

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.000
and this is where I think

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.480
to kind of come back down to earth

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.120
and to think about how we do

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.720
tangibly and realistically

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.400
that organizing

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.120
that I was alluding to in those conversations

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.640
you know, I kinda come back to this really basic point

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.240
one of the first things I wanted to do

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.080
when I became co leader of the greens

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.760
in Aotearoa was to go and talk to the coal miners

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.640
because so frequently, obviously

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.600
green movements are pitched against working people

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.960
particularly working class people in

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.680
you know, these industrial areas

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.840
so I don't have beef with coal miners

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.720
in fact I want them to live good lives

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.440
but we obviously need to decarbonize our economy

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.920
if we're gonna have a future and a livable planet

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.240
so went down to the West coast of the South Island and

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.720
I love

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.280
nothing more than a challenge of talking to people

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.080
who think that they'll hate me

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.120
and you know

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.600
after talking through some of those initial assumptions

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.560
about who I was and what I was there to do

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.120
we kind of

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.160
then immediately get down to the brass tacks of it

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.880
and it's crazy. At the end of the day

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.160
all these guys wanted was a decent income

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.360
to be able to stay in their community

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.240
and feel a sense of pride in what they do

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.360
Those are things we can agree on

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.000
that is the broadest base unifying thing

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.360
that brings together people in my country

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.760
people in your country regular people across the world

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.480
it's the foundations of Maslow's hierarchy of needs

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.800
that is where we will find our solidarity

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.760
that is the stuff that we can agree on

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.520
so I think that you know

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.280
when it comes to

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.800
kind of trying to reach across the aisle

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.680
and talk to these people

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.480
who are in these incredibly angry spaces

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.400
and are being co opted

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.120
and manipulated by the far right

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.000
obviously that's not a role for

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.520
particularly

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.080
those who are subjected to all of that hatred

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.040
but I do think

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.640
those of us who have a familiar or family connection

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.040
if we can just kind of spend the time and ask people

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.440
why they think the way that they do

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.600
and how they kind of came to those conclusions

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.840
you know people will come to unpack

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.440
and when they are talking about

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.240
why they think the way that they do

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.160
they will start to acknowledge themselves

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.080
if they're genuinely being listened to

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.280
that maybe there are some gaps in their logic.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.680
I think I think often there's less

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.960
between

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.520
some of the people who are supporting what we do

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.480
who want a wealth tax

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.440
and some of the people going on these marches

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.400
then you might think and I've seen some guys

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.120
there's a guy

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.480
there's a youtuber here called Jimmy the giant

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.720
I like and I think it was on

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.800
he tweeted it, but I think it was on Politics Joe

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.200
they went and they spoke to some of these guys

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.240
a lot of these guys want wealth taxes

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.800
and I think

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.760
the situation we have here is

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.920
you know everybody hates the Conservatives

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.440
it's understandable people are starting to hate Labour

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.520
and that's understandable as well

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.680
and then Reform our sort of new right

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.840
far right party, they

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.160
kind of win by being the only voice left in the room

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.960
because the left hasn't really been able to

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.720
establish a presence in social media

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.640
which is where these people are

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.960
or in the mainstream media

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.720
and I actually think there's a massive space

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.440
for a fourth voice

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.400
which doesn't have to be on the left, that

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.680
that really does anything

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.040
that centers living standards, economics

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.600
inequality, taxation

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.560
which is what I'm trying to be

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.280
it sounds like you're trying to do a similar thing here

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.760
I should ask you why you're here

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.440
you're obviously co leader of the New Zealand Greens

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.000
we’ve got a new leader of our British Greens

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.400
and he's Zack Polanski for those who don't know

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.040
He's great. He seems to be looking to do a similar thing

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.640
which is focus a lot on the economy

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.440
focus on inequality, be there on social media

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.960
be loud, make a voice

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.840
any opinions on him?

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.520
Oh yeah

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.840
no Zack and I met a few days ago and he's awesome

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.160
I think that he has an incredible opportunity to yeah

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.080
work with people, to have them realise

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.320
that all of these problems are so deeply interconnected

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.480
right? I mean

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.080
it's really funny because our name is Green

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.400
and our colour is green

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.760
of course we care about the environment

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.000
we care about saving the bats and our native species

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.480
and all of those other things

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.520
but we also care about all life on earth

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.680
you know, and it's really

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.760
bloody hard to get people to care about the end of the planet

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.640
or the end of life on earth as we know it

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.800
if they can't put food on the table

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.440
for the end of the week. So

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.680
any program that is focused on centering

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.440
kind of our ecological needs

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.520
or our planetary limits needs to bear in mind that

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.480
in order to change public policy

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.720
to get to that place we need to ensure that everybody

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.240
has their basic needs met

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.080
so I think it really is that simple

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.960
it's about understanding

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.320
the same system that is exploiting our planet

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.960
is exploiting and exhausting people

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960
and that's where we kind of

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.880
come back down to this really basic proposition that

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.720
what the hell are we all working so hard for

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.360
if not

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.120
to have a society that caters to our basic needs

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.960
I mean I hope it works

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.000
I hope it works

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.200
I sometimes feel that I'm sort of

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.640
the only guy pushing progressive voice on social media

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.320
and I know I'm not

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.080
I know there's lots of other people doing it

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.080
but I look at what Zack's doing

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.960
focusing on inequality, focusing on taxation

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.320
focusing on social media

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.080
and I hope it works cause

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.960
then I could go on holiday and feel like someone else

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.080
is doing it

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.240
He's got a really clear,

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.560
he's got a really clear message

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.840
and I mean this is kind of always my call to action

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.600
to anybody who, you know

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.920
is maybe sitting there at home and going

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.600
she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.280
well get involved!

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.840
Then get your hands dirty

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.080
 I will take critique from anybody

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.720
who is willing to bloody try

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.200
You know if enough of us try

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.880
then we'll win, I always say that

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.280
but let's not, let's not fight in the background right

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.640
let's bloody do it

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.320
I see too many circular firing squads

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.960
but I know you gotta go soon

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.600
before you go

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.040
I get criticized a lot for being quite pessimistic

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.480
because I am quite pessimistic

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.680
and given you know

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.920
the mood in this country at the moment

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.600
is quite pessimistic

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.600
I try my best to finish on messages of hope

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600
so I would like to ask you before we finish

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.240
do you feel hopeful for the future

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.440
is there something you feel hopeful about

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.640
what gives you hope?

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.280
I feel incredibly hopeful about the future

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.080
I wouldn't be able to do what I do if I don't

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.680
you know I travel around my country

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.560
and obviously been on the other side of the planet

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.960
for the first time in several years

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.960
And whenever I feel a sense of pessimism or despondency

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.920
or whatever you wanna characterize it as

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.320
just look for the helpers

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.760
and you will find abundant people

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.480
who are doing their best day in and day out

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.720
in ways big and small to make the world a better place

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.480
and if we start connecting the dots

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.960
between all of those actions

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.480
and those practices of people living their values

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.920
and doing the right thing

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.160
and we scale that up

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.000
then we've kind of changed the world overnight

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.640
you know, so yeah

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.320
I feel an incredible sense of hope

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.840
and I think that it's about people realizing

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.320
and this is my kind of classic

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.680
go to

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.480
that inspiration

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.880
is not a reason to put somebody on a pedestal

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.240
and go

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.120
that person's gonna solve all of the world's problems

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.120
clearly they're not you know

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:03.920
if you look at

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.080
all of the amazing things that human beings

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.320
have been able to achieve

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.160
in the arc of history, civil rights

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.400
gay rights, women's rights

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.000
whatever, it has always been

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.360
regular people working together at scale

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.720
to change our politics up against some of the most

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.640
heinous and difficult barriers

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.120
that you can possibly conceptualize

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.280
and imagine. So inspiration is a mirror

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.880
it is you seeing in somebody else

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.040
actually something that you admire about yourself

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.840
and that is an invitation to participate

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.760
and to be part of something bigger

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.880
and the kind of co benefit

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.560
or the other really awesome thing about that is

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.920
our mental health will be so much better for it.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.320
I hope so, I hope so

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.640
I think we can make it better

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.680
I think we can and I think that we have to

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.480
and I think that in the process of trying

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.200
we need to have some fucking fun

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.000
I'll try my best, that's never been a specialty of mine

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
but thank you very much

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.680
first ever politician on the channel

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.400
thanks for coming all the way over and yeah

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.680

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.680
