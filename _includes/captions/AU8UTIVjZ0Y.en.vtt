00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.080
all right so i want to talk about one of the&nbsp;most
common questions we get on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.920
which is:
What is rich?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.360
we get asked this a lot um and uh i think to be&nbsp;
honest often when people ask this the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.680
they're really asking is do you want to tax me?&nbsp;
because obviously we talk on the channel a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.680
about we need to tax the rich more, we need to&nbsp;
tax the rich more and people are basically worried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.040
that it's going to be them that pays more tax so i&nbsp;
think the best way to answer this is basically to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.000
give a kind of accurate description of the wealth&nbsp;
distribution in this country and sort of where we &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.920
are as a country um yeah with regards to wealth&nbsp;
and how it's distributed um the first point is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800
to make you know whenever i talk about taxing&nbsp;
the rich i'm always talking about high wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.760
individuals &amp; high wealth families it's not about &nbsp;
high income individuals or high income families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.360
who may not be necessarily high wealth um and i think&nbsp;
that's important because we live in a country now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.800
where housing is very very expensive and that&nbsp;
means that you could be high income you could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.600
you know a banker like i was or you could be a&nbsp;
lawyer or you could have you know you could work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.440
in some industry making 70-80 grand a year which&nbsp;
is which is much higher than the national average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.840
um and still be actually struggling to&nbsp;
afford a home things like this um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.960
i'm not at all looking to tax people you know&nbsp;
what i want to create here is a is a country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.120
and a world in which ordinary people can get&nbsp;
jobs work hard get paid have nice properties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.160
have nice lives afford families comfortably um&nbsp;
so when i talk about taxing the rich it's about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.440
high wealth families high wealth&nbsp;
individuals okay it's not about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.320
high income individuals who are not high&nbsp;
wealth you know i think it's i think i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.680
if you consider the situation we're in right now&nbsp;
you know i'm i'm not crazy rich and we'll get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.680
that but i earnt a lot of money in a short amount&nbsp;
of time and i paid 50% tax on everything i made um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.160
which was you know a few million pounds um whereas&nbsp;
at the same time the Duke of Westminster earnt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.000
inherited i think Â£9,000,000,000 &amp; paid nothing&nbsp;
so we currently live in a system where

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.640
people from poor and ordinary backgrounds who&nbsp;
earn decent amounts of money pay very high tax but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.160
people from very very rich backgrounds can earn&nbsp;
unbelievable crazy amounts of money it's important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.960
to realize you know this guy made more than a&nbsp;
thousand times what i made and paid less tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.760
than me it's pretty crazy right and when you look&nbsp;
at it like that you have to kind of accept that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.720
we actually have quite basically a class-based tax&nbsp;
system whereas people from my sort of background&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
my sort of voice and you know you don't need to&nbsp;
be from London you could be from wherever Glasgow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.520
or Manchester or Birmingham you know people&nbsp;
from ordinary backgrounds who earn high incomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.440
sometimes not even crazy high incomes pay 50&nbsp;
percent but people from very wealthy backgrounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.400
can earn billions and pay nothing so we currently&nbsp;
have a system where we're already taxing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.600
earners but we're not actually taxing these&nbsp;
very wealthy families in many cases at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840
so when i say tax the rich i'm talking about&nbsp;
very very wealthy families but then that still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120
leaves us the question of how wealthy is&nbsp;
wealthy okay so the first thing to say is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.240
this country the uk is actually it has&nbsp;
a reputation as a very unequal country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.040
but if you look you know from an&nbsp;
international or a historical perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.880
it's not a massively unequal country compared&nbsp;
to where a lot of countries are or or even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.120
where this country has been in the past so this&nbsp;
country still has a relatively high percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.160
people or families who own their own home you&nbsp;
know i think that owner occupied percentage is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.880
something like 78% um and that that's not the case&nbsp;
in a lot of countries right and it wasn't the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.400
in this country 100 years ago so what that means&nbsp;
is a lot of people or families do own property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.160
some somewhere in the family it might not be&nbsp;
you it might be your husband it might be your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.280
uh your father you know i mean but a lot of&nbsp;
families own property um and that means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.440
wealth inequality in this country is not&nbsp;
terribly bad you know if you go to a place like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.680
India which is very high inequality or&nbsp;
Russia which has very high inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.800
you'll see that ordinary families&nbsp;
often really struggle to own like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.480
decent properties whereas in this country&nbsp;
there is a lot of property owning people um

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.200
but what is happening is increasingly fewer&nbsp;
and fewer people are able to own property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.720
and especially if you look at younger&nbsp;
generations when it comes to owning property like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.160
they need to take really&nbsp;
really really big mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.760
so what that means is generationally&nbsp;
ordinary families are losing wealth um

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.520
and then there's a question of where is&nbsp;that
wealth going so when we talk about&nbsp;rich 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.600
what is rich? so to be in 
the top 1% of richest

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.360
people in this country you need&nbsp;
about three and a half million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.640
which is this is quite a lot of money i think you&nbsp;
know three and a half million pounds is a lot um

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.920
but one percent of people in this country do&nbsp;
have more than three and a half million pounds um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.000
so really you know often i suggest okay let's tax&nbsp;
people above that level three and a half million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
pounds um but i think actually the most important&nbsp;
thing is that you hit the people at the very top

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.960
and the reason i say that is if you bring in a tax&nbsp;
that effectively taxes people who are three and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.920
a half million pounds and three and a half million&nbsp;
pounds a lot of money you know if you're worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.320
three enough million pounds you can afford to pay&nbsp;
more tax um but if you hit those people but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.520
you don't hit say the Rishi Sunak, who is worth&nbsp;
apparently about 700 million pounds and his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.200
knows worth billions um if you tax people worth&nbsp;
three and a half million pounds and you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.840
tax people are worth 700 million pounds then&nbsp;
ultimately that wealth which is currently held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.920
by the three and a half million pound families&nbsp;
will end up being owned by Rishi Sunak and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.080
other people of that level of wealth you know so i&nbsp;
think really i'm i didn't come into this game as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.360
with really a moral ethical perspective i'm an&nbsp;
economist and um what i see is is an economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.960
where wealth is draining away from this you know we&nbsp;
we have a middle class in this country we have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.640
group of people sort of a middle 50% of people who&nbsp;
can live a comfortable ish life and can accumulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.600
assets but it's shrinking and their wealth is&nbsp;
moving to the super rich and i i see this economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.920
and i say okay well if that keeps happening&nbsp;
it's inevitable basically they'll be growing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.040
poverty basically and that's not a good thing and&nbsp;
it's the direction of travel is important right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.200
so if you don't do anything to reverse that then&nbsp;
what you will see is this middle class and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.560
know this might be a lot of people watching who&nbsp;
they own their own property, you know if it's in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.520
London they're probably like worth a million&nbsp;
pounds you know and maybe they don't have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.720
massive mortgage on it or maybe they do a mortgage&nbsp;
on it so there's a lot of people in London who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.920
might be worth 500 - 700,000 pounds because&nbsp;
their property values have gone up um these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.720
people will be squeezed out over time and the&nbsp;
way they'll be squeezed out is essentially that

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.840
the rich will use their enormous incomes to&nbsp;
buy assets from them um and i think there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.960
this problem where increasingly because house&nbsp;
prices are so high people who are not actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.520
rich they don't live lives of luxury think of&nbsp;
themselves as rich because they look at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.360
net asset their net worth and it's like it could&nbsp;
be a million pounds they could be a millionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.200
right um and don't get me wrong you know you&nbsp;
know if you do have a net worth a million pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.760
you're in the top two percent of the country you&nbsp;
know i mean you are well richer than average um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.520
but because house prices are going up and up&nbsp;
and up and up and up the only way to access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.200
that money is to sell your house and i think we're&nbsp;
increasingly seeing this interesting dynamic for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.800
ordinary families where they feel rich because&nbsp;
their house is worth a lot of money but there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.200
no way for them to ever access that money so then&nbsp;
they end up panicking that if i say tax the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.360
i mean tax them but the reality of this situation&nbsp;
is if we don't tax the rich they will get your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.960
house in the end you know they will get your&nbsp;
house in the end and they'll push the price up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.080
and up and up and up and up but eventually we'll&nbsp;
not be able to compete with it um so yeah look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.480
i personally where do i sit in all this you&nbsp;
know i'm i'm probably not in that one percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.520
i'm probably not worth three and a half million&nbsp;
pounds you know i don't see it i don't have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.160
spreadsheet or anything you know what i mean&nbsp;
um but i would be willing to pay more tax if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.520
the richest paid it as well you need to hit the&nbsp;
top you know and i've said it before in the news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.320
i'll pay if Rishi Sunak pays it but um if you don't hit&nbsp;
these super rich then they will use their enormous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.040
incomes to buy your assets and that is what you're&nbsp;
seeing they'll squeeze you out what we're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.000
increasingly is the middle class being squeezed&nbsp;
out now i know and i want you to think if you if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.160
you own a million pound house even if you're&nbsp;
in a 600,000 pound house i want you to think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.560
what are your kids going to do how are they on you&nbsp;
know regular income is 30-40,000 pounds you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.880
how are they going to buy a house when houses&nbsp;
cost 600 000 pounds you know what i mean are they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.200
all going to live in your house forever you know&nbsp;
you know this is the situation we are in is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.160
ordinary people in this country ordinary families&nbsp;
who do have wealth are losing their wealth year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.120
after year generation after generation to the&nbsp;
rich and if that is allowed to continue and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.120
then they are paying higher rates of tax than&nbsp;
the rich do if that is allowed to continue then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.760
is inevitable that we will see broad increase and&nbsp;
we will eventually reach a place of mass poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.800
in this country which we within 100 years ago&nbsp;
and you know you know go to India go to Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.000
and look at what really unequal economies look&nbsp;
like they are economies where ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.800
live very very difficult lives and&nbsp;
can't own property and if you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.600
it can't happen here well it happened here&nbsp;
it was like that here 100 years ago and um

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.600
you need to look at the direction of travel of&nbsp;
wealth are ordinary people getting richer or are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.760
ordinary people getting poorer are the super rich
getting richer or the super rich is getting poorer&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.040
at the moment we live in a time where ordinary&nbsp;
people are very rapidly losing their wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.400
and the rich are very rapidly getting it and you&nbsp;
need to look into the future and say where does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.440
that lead us as a country where does that leave&nbsp;
my family where does that leave my community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.040
and um you know we're going to talk&nbsp;
about different ways that that could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:26.320
addressed um i've got some ideas about ways we&nbsp;
can do it to sort of address that balance but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.680
ultimately if you allow wealth to flow from if you&nbsp;
want our wealth to flow from ordinary families to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.640
the rich and you have no mechanism to get wealth&nbsp;
back from the rich to ordinary families then it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.600
lead to a country of mass poverty and and you&nbsp;
know i've been betting on that happening for 15&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.000
years and i've had millions of pounds doing it&nbsp;
um and i think increasingly it's becoming obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.600
that that's the direction we're going right you&nbsp;
know half the country won't be able to heat their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.640
homes this winter in 10 years time that would be&nbsp;
70% in 20 years time it will be nearly everyone you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.480
know that's that that is that is what happens if&nbsp;
you allow the people of a country to have all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.480
their assets taken away from them you know you&nbsp;
need assets you need homes you need food and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:15.040
if you don't own anything it's going to be very&nbsp;
difficult to get that stuff so um you know i look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.120
at the world distribution and i look at the travel&nbsp;
of it and and and it leads me to see a very bleak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.120
future and and the way to push back into that&nbsp;
is tax the super rich and who is rich to be honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.320
Rishi Sunak is rich he's worth Â£700,000,000&nbsp;
listen i'll pay it if he pays it and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.040
i don't want any situation where people who are&nbsp;
not rich are paying *HIGHER* rates of taxes people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.800
who are really really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich and that's the&nbsp;
world we live in right now you know and i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.280
i've made a lot of money and i'm super grateful&nbsp;
but i'm not super rich i don't live a life of luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.360
but i paid 50% everything i earned and there's&nbsp;
billionaires in this country who don't pay that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.920
there's billionaires in this country&nbsp;
who paid less than me there's billions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.160
in this country that have paid less&nbsp;
than the people watching this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.920
and you know if that's the situation that&nbsp;
we have if that's the world that we live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.320
um yeah the future is going to be very dark indeed&nbsp;
but but we can push back and that's what i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.720
trying to do so uh so yeah i would just encourage&nbsp;
people to say look i'm not after i'm not after you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.840
i'm not after houses um you know i'm a relatively&nbsp;
sort of comfortably wealthy person myself um

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.240
but i see the direction of traveling on&nbsp;
me to change it so um i support it and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:38.080
hope other people do too so yeah 
tax the rich, the really rich (good?)

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.480
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.800
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.840
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
