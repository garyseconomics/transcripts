00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960
Okay welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.720
today we are

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.480
gonna explain

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.800
one of the biggest and most misunderstood

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.840
economic questions of our time.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.320
Why is housing so expensive?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.680
Okay so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.160
this is obviously

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.040
pretty much the biggest economic question

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.160
everybody wants to know. You might be asking

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.000
why we've not covered it on the channel before

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.920
and the answer is that we did cover it.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.320
Because it was obviously such a big issue

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.400
this was one of the first videos we ever shot

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.000
on this channel maybe four or five years ago.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.360
If you wanna see me back when I used to shoot my videos

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.560
walking around East London

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 looking younger and fresher

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.320
we'll put the old one in the description 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.880
but it only got about 5,000 views

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.160
cause nobody knew who I was at the time

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.600
So now we are gonna explain why housing is so expensive

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.840
and when I realized nobody had seen that old video

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.160
I was quite excited to do one

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.920
because I think we can really learn a lot

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.920
about some of the really

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.000
common ways in which the way that we talk about

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.560
and think about economics is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.520
is kind of dumb and is kind of wrong

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.720
and also I just think that this really

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.640
really important question is really

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
really commonly misunderstood basically

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.880
so I wanna explain in some quite simple ways, why the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.480
the way that you think about housing

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.320
and the way that you think about the expensiveness

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.680
of housing is wrong.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.400
So the first thing you need to understand

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
about the expensiveness of housing

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.000
is that it is a global issue

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.560
and what you often see

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.720
with housing and the expensiveness of housing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.320
is that people seem to think

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960
that it is something that is happening

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.480
specifically in their city and 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.960
when you, as I have done

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.400
you study and work with people from all over the world

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.440
and you travel around and when I travel around

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.520
I always like to speak to people about the economy.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.160
Basically everyone

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.720
in pretty much every big city in the world

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.200
thinks that there is a massive housing

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.800
affordability problem specifically in their city

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.000
so this is true in London and in New York

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.040
and in Los Angeles and in Tokyo

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.520
and in Shanghai and in Rio de Janeiro

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.560
and in Mumbai

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.640
and in Melbourne and Sydney and Vancouver and Toronto

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.960
I could just keep listing cities and cities

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.600
and I was in Portugal

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.200
in Lisbon and Porto, I was in Milan

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.280
basically everywhere you go

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.160
people think that there is a housing crisis in just

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.360
their city

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.160
and I think that is the first thing

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.560
that can teach us something

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.720
which is that this is quite obviously,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.000
once you step back and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.560
get a bit of distance and look at it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.160
this is quite obviously a global problem

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.000
which must therefore have a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.160
a global cause so for all

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.600
the guys out there who think this is specifically

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.920
Sadiq Khan's fault, for those of you who don't know

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.400
Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.560
I hate to break it to you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.600
but this is happening everywhere

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.880
and if it's Sadiq Khan's fault

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.240
he must be a really powerful guy

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.360
because this is happening

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.080
in every city across the world

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.600
and there is a real tendency

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.920
for people to think that the low affordability

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.000
of housing in the city or the region that they live

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.720
is being caused by their local mayor,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.160
is being caused by their local planning policy.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.760
That basically can't be true. If that was true

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.000
it wouldn't be happening in like

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
pretty much every major city in the world

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.840
so that's your first clue that this is misunderstood

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.280
it's global it's everywhere.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040
So it doesn't make any logical sense

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.520
to look specifically for the cause of the problem

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.400
to something that's happening specifically in

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.720
your town or your city

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.160
because it's not happening just there.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.720
So then next we can take a step back further

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.280
and I think this is probably the most

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.880
interesting point I'm gonna make in the whole video

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.440
so if you only take one thing away

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.880
listen to this. 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.640
So I'll explain to you

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.280
that the problem is not just in your city

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.320
the next thing that I'm gonna explain

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320
and I think

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.720
this really helps us to understand

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.960
what is going on here

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.080
is it's not happening just in houses

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.800
maybe that isn't immediately clear what I mean

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.760
so at at the beginning of Covid

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.920
and I've spoken about this a few times on the channel

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.080
I realized

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.000
very quickly

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.080
that the rich would acculate a lot of money

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.240
and I knew for like relatively obvious reasons

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.680
that that was gonna push asset prices up

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920
 because rich people

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.880
when given money

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.720
tend to spend almost all of it on assets

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.240
so I went and put a massive bet on

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.640
on the gold price going up

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.360
and since the beginning of the gold price

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.000
I put that on something like 1400 dollars

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.680
1450 or something like that

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.000
and now I don't even know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.720
I think it's 2,500

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600
I think it's it could be way more than that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.480
I think it's 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.000
let me check actually we can cut it in because 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.520
I think it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.640
I think it's something crazy now, 3,400 yeah

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.600
so I put that on at 1450

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.360
something like that and now it's more than $3,300

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.280
so just just since the beginning of Covid, 2020

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.800
you've seen in five years

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.720
the gold price go up about two and a half times

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.680
so massive massive increase in gold price

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.920
but it's not just gold right

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.040
like at the moment basically

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.920
every stock market in the entire world

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.840
is at an all time high

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.120
if you look at the US stock market massive

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.360
massive all time high

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.280
if you look at the German stock market

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.360
but also the gold price land prices

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.920
you look at the price of of farmland

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.120
it's gone through the roof

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.960
if you look at the price of even things like luxury art

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.760
luxury cars like basically every asset in the world

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.080
obviously with some exceptions

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.200
but every sort of hard

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.880
long term asset has massively increased in price

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.320
not just in the last five years since Covid

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.680
but the last 15 years since

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.200
since the Great Recession

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.000
the last 30 years

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.680
so when you step back and you get a bit of distance

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.680
what you see is what has happened to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.600
to house prices and in housing

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.640
is not at all unique to house prices and to housing

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.440
like

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.320
just like it's not unique to your city

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.440
it's happening everywhere

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.520
it's not unique to housing

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.760
it's happening in basically every asset

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.840
what you have seen in the short term

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.720
the medium term and the long term now

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.040
is just a massive increase in the price of basically

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.920
all assets when compared to things like wages

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.560
and I think this is the main way that its misunderstood

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.520
right because the housing crisis

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.360
for very obvious understandable reasons

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.000
the crisis of housing affordability

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.920
is always thought about as a crisis of housing

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.720
and then the the solutions and

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.960
and the

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.800
the causes and the reasons are always spoken about

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.960
as if they are specific to the housing market

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.920
 people always love to talk about

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.160
they're not building enough houses

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.400
people like to say it's because of immigration

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.360
but if it's because of us not building enough houses

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.080
why is the gold price trebled

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.560
why why are the stock prices trebling

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.520
why are land prices you know

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.480
quadrupling

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.520
This is a global asset price crisis

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.160
it doesn't make any sense

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.600
if you walk into the supermarket

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600
and the price of everything has trebled

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.120
and then you pick up the coffee and you say

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.600
why is coffee trebled and I say to you

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.600
that's because something crazy

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.920
happened in the coffee market

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.400
and this by the way

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.720
is exactly what happened during Covid

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.320
so at the beginning of Covid

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.280
it was very clear

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.280
there was gonna be a big increase in inequality

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.000
a big cash accumulation by the rich

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.200
and I was able to predict, if you don't believe me

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.800
go and watch the first video on the channel.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.680
I was able to predict as early as March 2020

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.080
that there would be a massive inflation crisis

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.920
and that prices of everything would go up

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.760
 and yet when the inflation crisis actually happened

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.600
people had a real tendency to be like

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.760
well the coffee price has gone up

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.480
because something weird has happened to coffee

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.480
and the price of a sugar has gone up

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.880
because something weird has happened to sugar and

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.840
and the rents have gone up

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.200
because something weird has happened to the rent market

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.920
and holidays have got more expensive

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.240
because something

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.440
weird has happened in the holiday market

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.680
and I think this is a really classic example of a very

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.720
very common way in which economists

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.360
and journalists who talk about economics

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.920
understand poorly and explain poorly the economy

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.800
which is they love to look at

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.120
kind of small picture explanations

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.800
for example if something's happened to house prices

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.800
it must come from the housing market

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.760
and they're very generally unable to see like

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.960
big picture causes

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.160
because it's not that hard to recognize well

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.120
house prices have gone up

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.880
but so have all other assets

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.800
so really what's actually happened is

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.960
is an asset price crisis

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.520
but economists just just never look at this basically

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.880
and you end up with

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.600
with these basically wrong explanations

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.480
which which is the

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.000
the problem is we're not building enough houses

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.120
the problem is 

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.720
the problem is immigrants 

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.240
the housing crisis is not a housing crisis

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.760
the housing crisis is a crisis of asset affordability

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.240
all asset prices have gone up enormously

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840
and that means you can't afford them

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.320
and now we're gonna explain why.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.240
So to explain why it is very

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.080
very simple really

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.520
I can do it in one sentence.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.640
When you give rich people money

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.800
they buy assets okay I'm not Jeff Bezos

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.520
I'm not a billionaire, I'm like a

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320
I suppose you could say like moderately rich person

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.840
if you were to give me a hundred grand

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.960
I could tell you exactly I would go that day

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.160
and buy 100 grand of assets

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.080
that is what I would do

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.720
because I have enough money to live my life

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720
I don't need any more money

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.280
I don't need to spend any more money

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.720
because I'm relatively rich

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.880
I have everything that I need

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.160
if you give me 100 grand

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.600
I will buy 100 grand of assets

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.760
and that is true for the vast majority of rich people

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.360
if you give rich people a ton of money

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.240
they buy assets, that's where it goes

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.880
so when we saw at the beginning of Covid

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.720
what should have been relatively clear,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.520
it is still not often spoken about.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.640
When we saw that rich people were gonna accumulate

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.920
trillions of dollars, pounds

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.920
euros, it should have immediately been extremely obvious

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.840
that house prices would go up

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.000
like nothing could be more obvious right

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.520
If we give £1 trillion

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.920
to the richest people in the country

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.680
obviously of course

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.720
house prices and stock prices

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.800
and the gold price will go up

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.400
this is nothing, nothing could be more obvious

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.400
and for the basic simple reason

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.840
you are competing with billionaires

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.760
and multimillionaires for ownership of the assets

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.800
so if these guys start to accumulate

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.160
enormous amounts of money

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.800
the asset prices will go up and

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.280
you will get less and they will get more

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.400
and this is what is happening in housing

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.720
this is what is happening in housing

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.400
 the rich accumulated a ton of money during Covid

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.600
but that is just 

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.960
a continuation of a pre existing trend

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.160
which was the rich are getting richer and richer

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.200
and richer and richer

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.800
as they accumulate larger and larger and larger

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.240
ownership of wealth that generates for them

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.000
more and more and more passive income

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.720
and there's basically

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.360
nothing they can do with that passive income

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.880
other than to buy the rest of the wealth

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.160
and that is why you're seeing house prices going up

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.920
that is why you're seeing stock prices going up

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.800
that is why you're seeing land prices going up

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.520
that is why you're basically

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.480
seeing all prices going up

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.840
these guys have tons of money

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.480
that they need to do something with

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.960
and they're using that to buy assets

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.280
and that is really why housing is expensive

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.120
but one thing

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.480
I think that kind of obscures this a little bit

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.800
is if we were to talk about gold or housing

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.160
it will kind of be obviously true

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.200
if you give rich people a ton of money

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.480
they're gonna go and buy gold

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.120
they're gonna go and buy,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.760
if you talk about gold or stock market

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.720
it's gonna be obviously true

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.240
they're gonna buy gold and stocks

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.480
but when you look at housing

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.480
housing is actually quite a special asset

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.680
in the context of western economies

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.280
especially here in the UK

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.120
especially in in the US for example

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.760
Housing is the asset

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.800
which is most likely to be owned by ordinary people

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.760
so most people don't have enormous

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.640
stock market portfolios

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.160
but a lot of ordinary people still in this country

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.960
in the US

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.120
in a lot of western countries own their own house

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.600
which may

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.640
in many cases nowadays be worth half million pounds

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.160
£1 million 

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.400
So that what you have here

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.080
is the fact that there seems to be a kind of conflict

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.880
right because

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.680
even though we know

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.520
rich people buy tons and tons of stocks

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.200
rich people don't appear to directly buy

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.320
tons and tons of housing

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.320
and what you're seeing here is basically,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.720
I did a video on on mortgages

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.720
 earlier this year

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.200
and I really wanted to do that video because basically

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.920
mortgages are the way in which rich people

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.280
buy and own your house, so

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.640
I've got a whole video on that

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.400
so if you want to go and watch the mortgage video now

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.920
after you can watch that 

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.120
but mortgages is a balanced system

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.200
the amount of money lent in society

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.680
equals the amount of money borrowed

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.360
so we've clearly seen

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.760
that the average size of a mortgage has massively

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.160
massively increased which means your average person

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.000
your average family here in the UK

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.400
in the US

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.880
across the world has this massive mortgage debt

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.120
something people don't realize is

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.480
if one group of society has a massive debt

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.440
then somebody else has to accumulate a ton of money

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.800
this is the way that debt works

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.360
you cannot be in debt to nobody

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.120
so it is only possible

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.880
for ordinary people to suddenly have these massive

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.280
massive massive mortgages

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.320
if there is a group in society

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.000
that is suddenly

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.400
accumulating this massive amount of money

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.720
this massive amount of credit

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.680
probably the easiest way I think to visualize that is,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.640
say I'm a rich person

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.480
I've got a million pound cash spare

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.800
I can do two things with that

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.560
I can either go and buy the house

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.160
or I can lend it to my sister who buys the house

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.040
the end result on the price of houses

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.200
is exactly the same so

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.520
rich people are pushing up the price of all assets

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.280
including housing

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.720
but when they push up the price of housing

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.640
it often comes through this channel of mortgage lending

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.400
and the reason you are seeing mortgages get much

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.360
much much bigger

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.960
is because rich people are pushing up the house prices

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.720
but they are also

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.480
simultaneously offering large amounts of

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.560
of mortgage lending

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.800
so it gets a bit obscured by mortgages

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.920
 but the

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.640
simple truth of the matter

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.280
is really simple right

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.800
you know if you are Rishi Sunak

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.080
if you are Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.000
Donald Trump, you know

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.240
you can only live in five or six

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.120
or seven or eight houses but you can own

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.440
especially by the channel

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.320
of mortgage lending and owning credit

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.120
you can own 1,000 houses you can own 10,000 houses 

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.880
and it's the same with the government you know

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.920
they're lending money to the government

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.040
that's the way they're taking possession essentially

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.160
of government assets

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.080
they're lending money to mortgage borrowers

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.080
that's the way they're taking possession of

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.960
housing assets

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.200
and in things like stocks and shares and land and gold

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.520
they directly buy these things. If you look

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.400
this is another point I wanna make

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.680
people often

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.840
look at the current level of unaffordability

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.080
of housing and they look at graphs

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.520
such as house price versus average wage

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.920
and they see that in the last 10

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.160
20 30 years

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.120
the average house price in the UK for example

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.400
has become extremely expensive relative to wages

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.720
compared to what it was 30 40

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.360
50 60 years ago and they often then say

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:45.840
oh well

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.120
that means housing now is unsustainably expensive

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.320
it is unaffordable for ordinary people

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.120
and house prices will have to come down.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.280
Go and look at what housing affordability is like

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.640
in the west in London

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.320
in New York

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.880
compared to extremely unequal places in the world

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.760
like Mumbai, like Shanghai

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960
like Hong Kong

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.480
like Rio de Janeiro like Sao Paolo

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.200
or compared to what housing affordability was like

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.480
here in the UK 100 or 200 years ago

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.400
when things were unequal, what you will find is

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.960
the historic outlier is actually not now

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.520
when housing is very unaffordable.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.320
The historic

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.120
outlier is that period after the Second World War

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.920
when housing was affordable.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.120
If you read about the history of of the UK or Europe

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.560
you know if you read your Dickens

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.160
and you will see that for most of history

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.880
housing was not affordable

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.680
and that was because for most of history

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.760
we had very high levels of inequality

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.920
we had this dipping inequality in the post war period

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.280
and what that literally means

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.560
is that dipping wealth

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.760
inequality means assets being owned by ordinary people

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.520
now we've moved towards a much more unequal society

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.840
the rich are much richer

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.360
ordinary people are much poorer

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.480
what that means is

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.360
you are increasingly competing with billionaires

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.200
and multi millionaires

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.800
with enormous amounts of passive income

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.400
for ownership of the houses

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.680
and you can't compete with them,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.480
and housing

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.520
will continue to get more and more unaffordable

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.760
as long as inequality increases

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.080
which its doing and which will continue to do

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.720
so the reason house prices are expensive

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.600
is because the rich are really

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.120
really really really

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.040
really rich now and

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.080
you can't compete with them

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.760
and unless you do something about that

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.920
you won't be able to.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.000
So this is the untold story of housing 

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.920
the untold story of affordability of housing

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.960
which is the real truth

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.280
is what you're simply seeing is

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.520
a change in distribution

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.920
a change in equality, a change in relative power

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360
You're losing, they're winning.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.000
So what does that mean about the kind of commonly given

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.080
stories about housing.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.600
The biggest one in this country is definitely

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.800
just build more just build more just build more 

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.920
this idea that housing is expensive

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.840
you should just build more houses 

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.080
so let's discuss that.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.800
So before we shot this video

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800
I just quickly went out onto my balcony over there

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.000
and I did a little count

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.960
of how many cranes I could see

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.920
I counted 13 cranes out there 

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.120
just what I can see from from my balcony 

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.760
so we are building more you know

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.520
we are building more

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.040
and if you go out to Ilford where I grew up

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.880
which is 

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.440
a very poor, central Ilford is a very very poor low wage

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.240
low rent 

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.520
area of  outer east London

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.640
they are just building and building and building

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.440
there's like a 40 floor skyscraper of flats in

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.200
in one of the poorest parts of London

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.320
and they're just everywhere, we are building them

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.880
we are building them but 

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.880
if you exist in a world

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.440
where all asset prices are increasing aggressively

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.160
quickly and that is what is driving house prices

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.440
how many houses do you think you need to build

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.320
here in London to stop or reverse a global

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.760
massive increase in the cost of all assets

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.680
you know it's not possible

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.120
you know if your town is being flooded

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.640
you are not gonna save your house

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.160
by just bailing your bucket out

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.760
you need to deal with

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.760
the massive increase here

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.400
and I think what you are seeing

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.480
and I see this all the time in economics and politics

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.120
is this aggressive focus on small scale issues

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.680
with this increasingly absurd

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.200
refusal to deal with what is driving it

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.720
inequality is increasing

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.400
inequality is increasing rapidly

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.760
what that means is you get less

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.600
they get more and

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.560
it means your house will be unaffordable

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.280
you're not gonna deal with that

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.680
by building more houses

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.960
you need to deal with that by stopping inequality

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.760
growth okay

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.720
but what if you do build more

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.320
because we are building more

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.320
we will build more.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.440
I wanna talk a little bit

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.880
and I have mentioned it before on the channel

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.120
about what inequality does to the physical

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.760
shape of cities and to the physical shape of countries

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.800
When you live in a relatively equal country

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.560
everybody's got some money everybody's got some wealth

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.960
everybody is a worker everybody is a producer

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.760
and everybody is also a consumer

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.840
and that means wherever you have a village or a city or

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.120
or a town you have workers and consumers

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.160
because everybody is a worker

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.480
and everybody is a consumer

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.760
but once you move towards very unequal economies

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.880
then you get like a splitting of workers and consumers

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.320
 all of the wealth

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.040
all of the the economic power

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.560
all of the spending power starts to be concentrated in

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.680
 a small elite and and they are the

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.560
people who can spend and everybody else has nothing

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.040
and that creates an imbalance right

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.280
because if everybody's a worker

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.320
and everybody's a spender then any

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.040
town any city is

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.800
balanced it has both workers and spenders

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.200
once you split those people

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.720
then suddenly you don't own your own home

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.280
you're kind of poor there's only a small amount of

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.920
people have money you need to live near them

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.280
because that's the only place to get a job

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.560
and that's how you see a kind of shape of country

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.920
and a shape of city which is really

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.160
really common in poor countries in

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.520
you know anywhere really Latin America

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.000
most of Africa, Southeast Asia

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.720
where you have these cities

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.360
which have unbelievably luxurious centers

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.160
surrounded by massive massive slums basically

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.200
that is the shape that an unequal economy wants to be

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.160
right because if the rich have all the spending power

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.280
then of course they want a super

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.280
like luxury place to live

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.240
so that they will build that

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.720
and everybody else needs to sort of swarm around them

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.160
 that is what our economy wants to look like

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.280
because here in Europe we

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.880
have moved from that relatively equal 60s

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.080
70s 80s period towards a very unequal

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.360
a very unequal economy now

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.960
and it is becoming more unequal

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.520
so you're starting to see this economic drive

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.000
to build these very unequal countries

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.480
to very these very unequal cities

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.520
and that is why people are saying build more

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.480
build more build more

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.840
I think we should be very careful

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.120
you know I live well 

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.600
I grew up in one of these areas outside the big city

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.680
these places are being very

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.200
very aggressively very rapidly slumified

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.680
there's lots of

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.200
enormously low quality housing being built up

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.600
I think you should be careful supporting

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.440
these build build

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.360
build policies that are not addressing the

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.840
growing inequality because if you do that

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.240
you will make places like London and places like

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.160
all of the big cities across Europe

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.200
you will make them start to look more like Mumbai

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.040
and like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.320
with massive slums. I would like to protect more

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.040
the ability of people to live where they want

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.280
I don't think people should be forced

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480
to all live in the city

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.840
and all live in the massive cities

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.360
and to do that

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.920
you need to address the growing inequality

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.960
not just build more more

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.280
more but beyond that

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.680
I think there is a really phenomenal

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.240
and quite interesting like naivety to this build build

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.960
build approach which really mirrors the phenomenal

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.960
naivety that we're seeing in a lot of mainstream

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.120
economic discourse at the moment

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.000
about the weakness of the economy overall

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.880
so you know

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.160
we have this New Labour government in

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.560
in this country and

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.520
their approach is

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.960
growth growth growth you know

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.640
they've got these posters out there to say growth

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.720
growth growth and and it mirrors this 

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.960
this commonly popular idea about the housing market

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.760
which is build build build 

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.200
and it kind of it seems

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.600
is based on this Assumption that you can just go and

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
you can just build a house

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.320
or you can just go and you can grow the economy

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.640
as if there's a bunch of resources lying around

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.200
as if there's like

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.160
a million builders sitting on the side

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.840
twiddling their thumbs with a bunch of concrete

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.680
and you can just bring them in

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.520
and get them to start building.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.920
We do not live in

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.280
economies full of unused resources

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.360
we live in very efficient economies

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.880
where basically all resources are used

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.680
and the vast majority of those resources

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.000
are owned by the rich

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.800
and the vast majority of those resources

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.080
are used by the rich and if you are a rich person

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.160
you control the resources we need to build more houses

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.080
and you get to choose

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.920
what you’re gonna do with those resources.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.320
Are you gonna build affordable housing

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.760
for ordinary people

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.640
you're in this economy

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.760
where you can rapidly see the shifting

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.000
power dynamics in the economy

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.680
the government is dying on its arse right

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.920
and that's not just the UK

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.800
governments are dying on their arse all over the world

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.520
right government is collapsing 

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.600
the working class is just devastated

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.560
the middle class is increasingly impoverished

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.560
and you have this small group of super wealthy people

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.920
who are just aggressively getting richer and richer

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.400
and richer and richer and richer

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.280
and you are a rich guy with some resources

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.960
that you get to choose what to do with

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.040
and you know, you're running a company

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.440
if you were running a company now, building company

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.320
construction company

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.480
in this economic context of a collapsing middle

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.680
collapsing government collapsing poor

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.280
absolutely skyrocketing wealth of the rich

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.680
what kind of housing are you gonna build?

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.080
You are gonna build super

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.720
luxury housing for super rich people

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.880
because they are obviously the guys with the money

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.240
right, it'sobviously...

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.560
and then when it comes to ordinary people's housing

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.800
you're gonna give them the cheapest possible thing

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.960
because you know that they have very

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.680
very little money

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.720
and they basically have to buy whatever they can

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.160
whatever they can give you 

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.840
we we need to deal with this absurdly

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.520
simplistic view of economics

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.200
which says things like build build

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.600
grow grow as if that is not what every government

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.440
for the last 30 35 years

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.120
all over the world has been constantly trying to do

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.160
and failing

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.280
the problem here is not not enough building

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.240
the problem here is not not enough growth

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.680
the problem here is rapid and aggressive

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.840
changing in distribution

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.080
and changing in your relative power position

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.920
if you are not a super rich person

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.240
you are the group that is losing

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.920
and that means you get less housing

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.800
it's as simple as that, build

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.160
build build, it's not gonna work

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.080
I often think when I hear politicians say build

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.280
build build when I go back to the house I grew up in

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.400
there's a massive massive

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.280
massive block of flats

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.400
now. I grew up in sort of a traditional terraced

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.240
small row terraced houses

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.400
there's a massive block of flats there

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.560
now blocking out the sun and the

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.320
you know,

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.400
that the street I grew up in is basically a slum

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.440
now. I always wonder when they say build

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.720
build build, these politicians

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.320
are they gonna build massive blocks of flats

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.120
overlooking their houses?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.120
Or are they gonna build massive blocks of flats

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.120
of extremely low quality housing

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.840
overlooking your house?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.600
and that brings me to my final point I wanna make

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.240
which is 

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.880
the idea that we just need to to slash red tape

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.840
we just need to let them build

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.200
we just need to let them build

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.960
so for those who are not watching in the UK

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960
everyone in the UK will know

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.560
we had the massive disaster in this

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.640
in this country in this city eight years ago

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.840
which was when  a block of flats burnt down

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.800
it's known as the Grenfell disaster and 72 people died

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.120
and it turned out that not just that block of flats

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.720
but flats all over the country

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.320
including the building that I'm talking to you from

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.800
had basically unsafe 

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.640
materials used in the building construction

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.360
and that buildings all over the country

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.120
we're not safe from fire. Listen

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.680
 I'm not a red tape guy 

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.320
do you really think that

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.160
the best way to improve housing affordability

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.360
it is to slash

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.560
safety standards 

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.960
I think it's probably not the right way to do it.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.120
So that brings us to an end of this first video

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.400
on housing.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.680
I can't believe I've not done one for so long. Listen

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.320
build build build grow

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.920
grow grow always begs the question, with whose money?

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.680
Because the rich own those resources

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.880
that you need to build.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.560
Why on earth would they give those resources to you?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.160
They have a choice over what to build

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.720
they have a choice over how to use their resources

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.720
and you have a choice as well you know

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.320
you can try to borrow from them at rates of interest

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.480
which have to compete with financial markets that

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.960
that wanna build shit for the rich

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.400
you'll lose money

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.320
you'll run a loss governments will be bankrupted

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.920
if you're losing your resources every single day

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.000
every single year

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.840
you will get poorer and that means less housing

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.400
it also means less healthcare it means less education

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.320
if you wanna stop that

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.480
the only way to realistically do it

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.240
is to deal with the fact that you

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.920
are losing resources 

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.280
you cannot live in a country and economy

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.680
which is not growing

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.040
where the rich get richer and richer

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.080
and richer and richer

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.680
and not expect to get poorer and poorer

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.800
and poorer and poorer

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.640
the reason you're losing your housing

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.520
is the same reason you're losing your healthcare

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.480
it's the same reason you're losing your education

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.400
it's the same reason that you're unable to get good

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.200
jobs

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.360
it's because you are being squeezed out by that rapid

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.560
unbelievably rapid growth in wealth and luxury

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.280
and living standards of the rich.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.000
If you don't fight that fight

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.720
you lose your wealth you lose your resources

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.120
you lose your living standards

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.200
you lose your housing

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.160
so in answer to our opening question

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.720
why is housing expensive,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.640
it's because the rich are buying it all

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.120
and you can't compete with them

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.080
the way to deal with that is to tax the rich more

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.440
to tax working people less

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.000
that is why we campaign here

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.520
to tax wealth not work

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.640
support us send this video to your friends

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.880
send it to your mum.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.640
It doesn't have to get worse

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.560
it can get better

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.920
but you're gonna have to make it happen yourself, good luck.
