00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.360
Today we're going to talk about interest rates and house prices.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.640
So I want to talk about a very interesting thing

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.600
that's happened in the last year or two,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.920
which is that

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.960
interest rates have risen

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.000
very aggressively

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.640
all over the world, including here in the UK.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.320
And everybody has been expecting

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.480
that that is going to cause a big fall in house prices,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600
which hasn't really happened.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.920
So today we're going to explain

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.160
why that is and talk about what it means for you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.240
and what's going to happen from here.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.280
And we're going to end up with a nice, sort of,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.680
concept that I use to understand more broadly

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.760
what's happening in the economy,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560
which I used for a long time.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.280
So I want to start by basically going

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280
through the story

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.120
of house prices since the beginning of COVID,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840
because that is when big dramatic change

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.440
started to happening.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.360
So at the beginning of COVID,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.680
there was a ton of predictions

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.560
that house prices would collapse.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.760
And at the same time,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.400
I wrote my first article in March 2020

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240
and we made our first video on this channel in June 2020.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.360
I predicted we would see a very aggressive

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.080
increase in house prices, which we did

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.880
so from the beginning of COVID until sort of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.040
the end of 2021

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.400
There was a super aggressive

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040
increase in house prices all over the place.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.600
So that first question is why

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.840
did everybody make such bad predictions

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.960
about house prices in the early COVID?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
I think this is based on a very simple logic,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.920
which I think a lot of people

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080
have kind of built into their brain,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.520
which is that when the economy is bad,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.800
house prices fall and stock prices fall.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.240
And lots of people believe this.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.400
I think this is

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.840
it's almost kind of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.280
how we're trained to understand the weak

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.840
economy is a collapse in the stock

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.680
market, fall in house prices.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.000
a common logic. It's widely believed.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120
It's totally incorrect.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.840
I think the most

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.280
obvious example of that is if you go back and look at 2008.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.560
2008 is an interesting example

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.400
because of the initial onset of the 2008 crisis,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.320
we saw really massive fall in stock prices

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.040
and in a lot of the world

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760
we saw pretty dramatic falls in house prices as well.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.600
But if you look at the long term picture of 2008.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.640
2008 was actually the start of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
an enormous house price boom and an enormous

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.760
stock price boom. So immediately there were sharp falls.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.360
But over the next sort of 10, 12 years,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.480
we saw truly enormous house price rises

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.800
here in the UK, in the US, basically all over the world. So

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.680
what you have here is a good example of a case

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.000
where the economy was actually phenomenally weak

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for the sort of 10 years after 2008.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.440
And yet what we actually had was really aggressive

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.720
increases in house prices, really

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.920
aggressive increases in stock prices.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.360
So this is the first challenge to this commonly held idea

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.760
that when the economy is weak, house prices go down.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.400
If you look at 2008,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.840
what we actually have

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.280
is a situation where the economy was

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.040
phenomenally weak

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.520
and it caused an enormous boom in house prices.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.680
But despite that happening after 2008,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.000
this idea still exists in the popular consciousness,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.600
and it exists in the minds of

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.000
economists, people who write

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.600
articles in the media about economics

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.160
that when the economy is weak, house prices fall.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120
And I really clearly remember at the beginning of COVID,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.520
when I wrote for The Guardian

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.400
saying house prices are going to go up.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.960
At the same time, Larry Elliott, the chief

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.840
economics correspondent of The Guardian,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.000
wrote an article, and we’ll link it in the description

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.440
so you can see, saying house

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.360
prices are going to collapse later this year.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.760
So why was it that I was then able

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.000
to make this correct prediction

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.080
when basically everybody else was predicting

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.160
that house price crash didn't happen?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.320
The reason for that is essentially

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.200
because my background as a trader

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.680
and as a economist is an inequality economist.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.200
So at the very beginning of COVID,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.880
it was very clear

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.400
that governments were going to give a ton of money out.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.560
And I cannot emphasise

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.640
how enormous the amounts of money

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.720
given out by the UK government,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.880
The US government, governments

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720
all over the world were during COVID,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.120
and this was already pretty obvious very early in COVID.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.440
So of March/April 2020,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.920
we knew there's going to be a long lockdown.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.080
Governments are going to give an absolute ton of money out.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.600
So for me,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.680
I think most traditional economists are like,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.280
they’re giving money out because the economy is weak.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.360
Weak economy, house prices are down.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.320
But for me,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.200
as an inequality economist, I wanted to know

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.920
who is going to end up with that money.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.120
If you are focusing on distribution,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.200
that's the question you want to ask.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.040
So we know the government's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.840
going to give out huge amounts of money.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.160
We know somebody is going to accumulate

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.240
huge amounts of money.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
Who is it going to be?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.560
And what that meant was,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.920
I was able to realise

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.960
what was then and I think still is now,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.400
the most important and underappreciated

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.520
consequence of COVID,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.240
which was this enormous

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.080
amount of money given out by

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.000
the UK government,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.400
also the US government, global governments

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.280
will be accumulated by someone.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.080
It will be accumulated largely by richer people.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.120
And what that means is

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.480
COVID will lead to a situation where

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.760
rich individuals and rich families

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.160
have got absolutely enormous amounts of money.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
And I think that was the big thing

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.760
which was missed by economists

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.400
and still is being missed by economists.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.600
And if you understand

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.200
that one of the consequences, in my opinion,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.760
probably the most important consequence

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.800
economically of COVID

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.440
is that rich people will accumulate

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.760
enormous amounts of money.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.720
I genuinely meaning, enormous amounts of money.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.080
We're talking about your average rich individual

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.800
accumulate 100, 200, £300,000.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.800
You know,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.440
the average billionaire increased their wealth by,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.800
I think, something like £720 million

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.840
in the first year of COVID. Right.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.480
So enormous accumulation of wealth by the rich.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.960
If you know that's going to happen.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.320
It's just totally

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.800
insane to predict anything other

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.480
than a massive increase in house prices

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.360
because what the rich people do with their money,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.800
they buy assets,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.920
they lend it out to people who want to take out mortgages,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120
they essentially then drive house prices up.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.480
If rich people get their money,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.920
house prices will go up, stock prices will go up.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.640
I made these predictions and that's what happened.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.680
But then a really interesting thing started to happen,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.840
which was about two years ago.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.480
Interest rates started to rise.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.760
In this country from effectively 0% to just above 5%.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.840
Similar in the US, similar issue in Europe.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.840
They didn't reach quite the same high levels.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.520
And that changed the dynamic basically.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.400
So that moved us into this new situation, which is

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.080
economists and traders

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.160
have this very strong belief

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.920
that when interest rates go up,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.960
asset prices and house prices should fall.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.880
And that is for a very understandable reason,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.720
which is in the case of house prices,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.440
if people can't get a mortgage,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.840
if interest rates are super high

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.280
and lots of people, lots of you have witnessed that,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.040
that it's much more difficult to get a mortgage

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.000
when interest rates go up.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.240
And also on the flipside.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.280
Rich people can now get 5% interest on their cash.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.520
So maybe they're not going to buy houses.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.240
They'll just keep the cash

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.360
and they'll get their 5% interest rate

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.840
and will be happy with that.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.840
And everybody started to predict,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.600
you know, in many cases, the same thing people

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.320
who predicted a house price crash

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.400
at the beginning of COVID,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.840
came back and said, okay, well, now

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.040
we're definitely going to get house price crash

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.720
now because not only have

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.800
we got this terrible economy,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.440
but we've also got very high interest rates.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.680
But what actually happened was that,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.400
you know, basically house prices,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.760
they sort of stumbled a little bit.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.280
But I think the broad picture of house

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.480
prices, it depends where you look is they rose

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.280
super quickly sort of 30% or so in 2 years.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.920
And then since then they've kind of

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.760
maybe stumbled down 5/6%.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.640
And it was during this rapid rise

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.400
in interest rates that I gave my interview

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.280
with Aaron Bastani on Novara Media,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.520
which you can find on YouTube.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.440
That was when interest rates

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.160
had just started to rise really quickly

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.280
and then everybody was saying

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.400
house prices are definitely going to fall.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.240
And I came out and said, no,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.160
I think the house prices will actually,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.840
in the long run, continue to rise.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.440
And

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.640
I think

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.960
I've kind of been borne out again

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.000
here, that this crash hasn't happened.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.360
But the house price growth has definitely slowed.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.400
And I think we could already sort of see

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.800
when when I said that 18 months ago

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.640
that that house prices were basically stopping,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.080
they were not going up any longer.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.760
So

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.320
now everybody is saying and have been saying

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.600
for the last couple of years,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.080
especially in the last 6 months, 12 months,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.760
why on earth

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.840
have house prices not fallen

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.000
despite these massive rises in interest rates?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.200
And people have been saying

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.360
the same thing about stock prices.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.920
If stock prices go up

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.000
very aggressively, all the classic economics says

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.960
stock prices should fall.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.040
But I checked the stock markets yesterday,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.440
before I filmed this video, we’re

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.160
filming this in the middle of December.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.520
Yesterday, French stock market hit a new all time high.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.680
German stock market a new all time high.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.880
US stock market is just below the all time high,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.480
which it hit basically before the rates went up.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.760
And this is the same in most of the world.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.760
Most global stock

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.760
markets are at or through all time historic highs.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.600
And I think this is,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.720
first of all

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.040
something worth realising

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.960
because I don't think people are aware

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.080
that in the space we

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.240
are in now, in the economy

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.760
where living standards are collapsing,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.120
there's a sort of broad consensus for an economic crisis.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720
I would think you can justify the economic disaster,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.120
that the vast majority of global stock

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.440
markets are at or through their all time highs.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.920
So that's the first thing, which I think is

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.320
first is worth internalising.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.680
And the second thing is

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.400
why has again everybody been so wrong?

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.840
Why is it that despite these massive increases

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.880
in interest rates,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.120
we haven't seen these house price falls,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.160
we haven't seen the stock market falls?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.200
And me personally, I'm not surprised by what's happened.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.640
If you go back

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.800
and look at my predictions at the beginning of COVID,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.560
I said we would have massive increases in inflation

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.600
and we would have increases in interest rates.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.280
So my predictions that

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.080
house prices would rise and stock

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.120
prices would rise, which they have

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.680
was factoring in an acceptance

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.880
of the fact that inflation and interest rates would rise.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.880
And the reason I was able to do that

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.800
is because I understood

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.360
this basic driver

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.000
once again is the big thing everyone is missing,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.920
which is that rich people have accumulated

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.200
an unbelievably enormous amount of money.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.720
I think increasingly the big driving factor behind

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.600
economic incorrectness.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.520
I think as a trader, you always want to work out

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.000
what is the big thing that's being missed?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440
And the big thing that has been missed

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.600
since the beginning of COVID

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.800
and still is being missed now,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.320
is that the rich accumulated

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.360
an unbelievably enormous amount of money.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.680
If you understand that,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.440
then everything that has happened

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.400
from the beginning of COVID

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.520
since the rise in interest rates makes total sense, right?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.080
If the rich accumulate a ton of money,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.600
asset prices will rise, but also inflation will rise.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.920
They will start buying more stuff.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.600
You know,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.920
they will increase their consumption of rental housing.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.440
They will buy more houses, they will rent bigger houses.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.680
That with push rents up, they'll push prices up

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.360
and then they'll push inflation up

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.960
and that will probably push interest rates up.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.280
But if the reason that interest rates have gone up

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.480
is because rich people have an enormous amount of money.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480
Then of course

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.640
prices are not going to fall

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.440
because the driving force here,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.560
the first impetus, the first push

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.520
is a massive accumulation of cash of richer people.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.040
So I think everything is really consistent with that.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.560
If you understand the first move

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.840
in this economic crisis

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.840
as being an enormous accumulation of cash

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.600
by wealthy people,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.440
then you would expect

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.600
exactly what we have seen, which is

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.440
pretty much exactly what I've been predicting throughout,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.920
which is massive inflation,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.920
big increase in asset prices,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.040
big increase in interest rates,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.320
but asset prices don't fall.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.840
That's basically what I've been saying.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.000
But what is interesting now

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.960
is I think we're moving into the next stage of this,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.800
which is which is what I've been calling for a long time,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.240
which is

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.400
if, in my opinion,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.240
the inflation is caused

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.960
by this massive

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.360
transition of cash,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.360
gift of cash essentially from the governments to the rich,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.560
then you would expect that inflation

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.120
to be a kind of one off and then stop.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.680
Because that gift was a massive one off gift.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.640
And then it didn't stop, essentially,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.160
but it left without a lot.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.040
Which means that the inflation happens once

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.520
and then basically goes away

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.560
and that is,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.560
you know, what I predicted in my predictions

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.720
a year ago, a year and a half ago

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.120
and is basically what we’re seeing.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.120
Inflation is collapsing all across the world.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.680
It is still above the 2% target in most countries,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.600
including here in the UK at the moment.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.760
But the direction seems to be aggressively down. And now

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.160
economists are starting to predict

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.560
that central banks will all start cutting.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.200
And I put a few bets on early this year that...

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.520
At that

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.600
time, early this year,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.880
markets were saying that UK

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.240
interest rates would reach nearly 6%.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.160
Whereas in the middle of next year, 2024,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.880
this might be 2024 when this goes out actually,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800
so in the middle of 2024

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.880
Interest rates were expected

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.760
to reach nearly 6% here in the UK.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.400
Now they're expected to be only just above 4%.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.280
And I think that even that,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.680
to be honest, that prediction might be too high.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.600
I think rates might end up going down even lower than that.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.040
And the reason for that is

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.720
at the same time

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.880
as the rich have accumulated a ton of money,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.800
and this would be very visible and obvious

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.840
to anybody watching from an ordinary background,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.680
the financial situation of ordinary families

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.040
is being extremely tightly squeezed.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.800
And it is ultimately ordinary families

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.040
that drive the economy.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.760
And rich families tend to buy assets. So

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.480
as ordinary families get poorer, inflation

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.480
will will start to fall.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.720
Now, once those interest rates come down,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.200
what those interest rates did,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.960
and we can all see, that is they

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.600
temporarily stopped that aggressive rise in asset prices.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.040
So once we know that rich people have a ton of money,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.680
asset prices should go through the roof

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.240
because the amount of money that accumulated in COVID

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.520
was truly enormous.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.240
But the interest rates do two things.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.520
One, they make rich people happy to sit on the cash,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.360
taking interest rate...

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.440
taking interest from the government,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.440
because they’re making a 5% interest on it.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.600
And two,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.800
it prevents them from doing mortgage lending

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.400
because if you go to the bank,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.280
you can't get a mortgage

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.800
because interest rates are too high.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.840
They can’t actually lend the money out.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.200
Once those rates come down, those two factors will end.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.600
Rich people will stop being content

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.160
to sit on this enormous pile of cash.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.560
They'll go back to buying assets again.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.160
And they will start,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.200
they will start doing more mortgage

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.800
lending again, which will drive asset

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.720
prices and house prices up.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.520
So I think

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.200
we're moving into the next stage of this now,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.280
which is another really, really aggressive

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.400
asset price inflation, including house prices, of course.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.680
So I wanted to talk a little bit about this concept of

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.560
once rates come down,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.120
the rich will start using this enormous pile of money again

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.880
to buy assets.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.360
Because I think there is this

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.000
concept that exists and I hear economists

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
on the news suggest this kind of idea a lot,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.160
which is that, okay, savings are very high right now.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.920
The rich have a load of savings.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.800
They need to spend it down, and they'll spend the savings

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.480
and the savings will go away

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.360
and they'll stop having their effect.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.360
And I think this is, this is just not how money works.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.360
If I have a ton of savings and I

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.360
buy your house,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.120
I don't have the savings anymore.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.320
But you do have the savings. Money doesn't work like that.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.560
Once the government gives a ton of money

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.200
out, as it has done,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.320
somebody has to hold onto that money

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.280
until the government taxes it back.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.960
Money doesn't disappear.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.840
You cannot simply disappear your money.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.000
You can only give it to somebody else.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So what this means is

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.680
the idea

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.120
that this massive accumulation of savings by the rich

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.840
is going to have a one off temporary effect,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.600
is just basically wrong.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.640
This will have a massive driving effect

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.080
for a long period of time.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.920
Because the rich are going to go around

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.280
trying to buy all of the assets.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.000
But who owns most of the assets?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.880
It's the rich.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.680
So when the rich try to buy assets,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.560
all they do is they buy the assets from one another,

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.280
they drive the asset prices up.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.440
And the money,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.600
this enormous amount of savings simply circulates

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.560
between the rich people and they’re effectively

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.080
unable to, unsuccessful at, getting rid of their savings.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.520
They simply cannot get rid of their savings.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.240
It is impossible

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.120
because they're buying assets from each other.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.920
So how do rich people actually get rid of their savings?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.160
Well, the only way rich people can get

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.680
rid of these enormous savings which they’ve accumulate

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.360
from the government is to buy assets from somebody

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.120
who is not rich.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.240
But what groups are there in

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.560
society of people who are not rich, who own assets?

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.920
There's basically only,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.840
the sort of, property only middle class,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.080
and there are still a lot of non

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.000
rich people who own property in this country.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.440
And the other obvious example is the government.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.200
So it creates this massive drive for the rich to buy assets

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.200
from the middle class, to buy assets from government.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.920
The other thing they can do

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.520
is they can lend that money to the middle class.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.560
For example,

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.200
mortgage lending to the government, for example,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.240
the government would need a lot more money

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.640
to support the rapid increasing poverty in the country.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.800
But in both cases they get the money back.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.040
If I lend you money for a mortgage and you buy a house

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.480
from a rich person,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.800
I get the money back when you buy the house.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.960
If I lend the money to government,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.040
they use it to pay your rent, I get the money

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.880
when you pay your rent.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.400
So

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.920
this money creates a force, it's

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.440
kind of a vacuum in a sense,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440
to suck the wealth away

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.440
from middle class, away from the government,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.040
to drive the middle class into debt,

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.000
to drive the government into debt.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.680
And that is the only possible way

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.080
that the rich can get rid of this

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.720
enormous accumulated money.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.480
So I think that is basically the state of play.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.320
That is where we are.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.840
I think we're moving into a really interesting

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.240
next phase of this, which I want to talk about a bit,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.760
which is rates. Inflation will come down.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.800
It's already come down a lot. Thanks Rishi Sunak.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.720
He did it apparently. in every country in the world.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.640
Interest rates will come down

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.440
and asset prices and house prices will increase enormously

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.360
and that will happen

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.400
essentially to the rich buying assets from each other,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.960
but also aggressively buying the assets

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.680
of the middle class,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.880
bankrupting the middle class, buying assets

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.240
from the government, bankrupting the government.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.000
And we've really seeing that.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.800
We're seeing decreased

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.280
financial positions of the middle

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.560
class, decreased financial decisions

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.000
of the government,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.600
and massively increased financial positions of the rich.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.080
And I think

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080
underneath this,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.640
I wanted to bring you quickly something

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.080
which I will probably talk more about, the future videos.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.440
There's a general concept here

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.160
which I think is useful to understand,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.120
which is something that I wrote about

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.400
when I was at university and something I think about a lot.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.240
Which is that

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.280
when inequality increases,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.640
and it has increased really rapidly,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.680
especially in the last few years,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.640
it changes the shape of the economy.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.280
It means that rich people have more wealth

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.280
and ordinary people and governments have less wealth.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.400
And what that means is society

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.520
as a whole starts to demand

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.120
less goods and services and demand more assets.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.760
And that is because ordinary

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.960
people spend the vast

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.040
majority of their income in their lives

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.480
and rich people save,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.200
which means essentially used to buy assets

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
the vast majority of their income.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.320
So as inequality increases,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.880
ordinary people’s

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.080
spending power goes down,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.080
rich people’s spending power goes up,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.400
which means society as a whole says

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.160
we don't want goods and services anymore. We want assets.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.040
Well, who is that good for?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.200
People with assets, the rich.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.360
Who is that bad for?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.120
People who produce goods and services,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.760
which is working people. So it creates this

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.640
kind of centripetal force in society.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.720
If the rich are richer, it benefits the rich

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.080
because they want the things which the rich have.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.160
But it also means you get this interesting

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.520
disconnect between two kinds of inflation.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.400
And I probably would talk about this more in other videos.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.160
But when you see inflation spoken about on the news,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.920
they are normally talking about things

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.720
like CPI, consumer price inflation, which is inflation

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.080
in goods and services.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.320
It doesn't look at inflation in things like asset prices,

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.640
but when economies are becoming rapidly more unequal,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.080
they don't really want goods and services

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.800
because ordinary people are becoming poorer.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.640
What they want is assets, because rich people

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.760
obviously richer.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.000
So you get a natural deflation in goods and services prices

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.320
and it invests in assets.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.440
But we don't look at the asset inflation.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.760
Central banks

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.360
when they consider what interest rate to do, the news

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360
when talking about inflation,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.880
they only look at goods and services inflation.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.000
So we will move into a situation where

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.560
goods and services inflation,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.680
and in particular wage

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.240
inflation is very, very low, maybe even negative,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.760
which means central banks cut rates.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.600
Which I think they both are doing relatively quickly.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.080
And then you get this like double whammy impact

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.760
on asset prices, which is first of all,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.440
the rich are making a ton of money,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.920
so assets want to go up.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.320
Secondly, interest rates are collapsing,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.760
so assets go up even more.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.720
So you get this kind of disconnect.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.840
Which is, the ordinary economy is sh*t basically,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.080
there's not a lot of inflation.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.800
And I think we will move into this world soon.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.560
So interest rates come down,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.840
whereas asset prices are going massively through the roof.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.680
And that's what we saw after 2008.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.480
And I think that's what we're going to move into

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.600
in the next year

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.040
or two here in the UK and in the rest of the world.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.080
And I think we need to have a think about what that means

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.040
for our society, because

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.880
if you haven't watched it,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.720
I recommend watch the video on this channel

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.600
called the Asset Economy, because

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.760
I talk a lot in that video

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.000
about what it means for us as a society

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.560
and the different groups of people in society

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.280
If asset prices and house prices go up aggressively,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.160
which I think they will do shortly.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.480
But I think the most interesting thing about is,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.640
in my opinion, increasing asset prices

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.680
and increasing house prices will be bad for 90% of society.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.720
And I think

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.120
some people might be surprised to hear that

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.000
because I think a lot of families

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.480
that own their own property

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.920
and a big chunk of families in this country still do own

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.120
their own property, will feel like they're winning

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.840
when house prices go up.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.000
But the truth of the matter is the only way

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.240
to actually benefit personally

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.640
from rising house prices is to sell your home, basically.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.720
And,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.280
you know, as more and more young people are seeing,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.440
it's becoming increasingly impossible to buy a home

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.440
if you don't have money from your parents.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.640
Which means that

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.200
if the older generation sells their home

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.440
to benefit from the increased asset prices,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.680
then their younger generations, their kids

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.680
and grandkids will basically become homeless

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.800
and will basically be stuck in poverty essentially forever.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.400
So I think we need to think a lot

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.240
about what it's going to mean for our society

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.200
when house prices go up even more.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.200
I think it will impoverish,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.400
you know, 80/90% of our society.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.800
But I think it will also be hugely politically divisive

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.200
because there will be a lot of families that own property

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.800
that will feel like it's a good thing for them

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.840
that want to support it,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.760
despite the fact that it's long run

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.160
impoverishing their family.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.440
So I think we need to prepare for this basically.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.280
We need to understand ourselves

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.840
that rising house prices

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.560
is part of a mechanism

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.200
which is impoverishing ordinary families.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.760
We need to understand that, we need to share that,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.280
especially with people perhaps in the older

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.920
generation who own property who think it’s good.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.320
We need to be able to explain to them and to other people

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.840
how these rising property prices

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.200
are going to really impoverish future generations.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.320
So my end message on this is,

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.760
things are going to change relatively quickly.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.840
We're going to move into a complicated space where

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.920
the economy stays terrible.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.040
And I think it will get worse.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.480
Living standards stay terrible, and I think they will get worse.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.640
But asset prices and house prices will start to increase.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.200
And that could be very divisive in our societies.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.880
What you need to understand,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.640
what you need to convince your parents

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.560
and grandparents to understand if you can't,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.120
is that this is not society getting richer,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.840
this is society getting poorer.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.560
Living standards for the masses

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.560
all getting worse and will continue to get worse.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.120
That is a consequence

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.280
of the massively increasing inequality

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.000
and massively increasing wealth

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.120
of the rich in our societies.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.280
The only way to stop that

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.920
is to tax rich people more aggressively

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.720
so that ordinary people

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.440
can have a fairer

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.760
share of what we're producing in our societies.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.680
We can do that, if we tax the rich,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.600
we can make life better.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.960
I'm going to be pushing that on this channel.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.640
So please

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.600
share this video with your friends

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.040
and family, support us and help us stop things

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.280
from being a disaster. Thank you very much.
