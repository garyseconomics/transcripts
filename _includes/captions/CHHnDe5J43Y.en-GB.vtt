00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.252
This is a clip from my upcoming interview

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:06.172
with Waterstones about the book,
The Trading Game

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.590
that's coming out March the fifth.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.845
If you preorder from Waterstones
using the code in the description,

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.346
then you can get 20% off.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.723
So that will be valid for all preorders.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.349
So up to March 4th.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.934
Hope you enjoy the interview.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.854
You actually, you describe very well
the sort of unhappiness

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.941
actually that comes from being given that
kind of wealth, living the kind of life

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.944
you were living, going to different parts
of the world as part of your job.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:32.490
But really none of that actually
making you happy or filling the void.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:33.658
You know, it's a funny one.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.327
This didn’t
get into the book, actually, but

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.871
suddenly it's coming back to me.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.082
One conversation I had with the girl
who I was dating at the time,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:45.253
and I got this first big bonus,
and it's one of the first few moments

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:48.548
when I sort of actually thought about
why does this money not make me happy?

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.384
And I think when you’re...

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.135
I don't want to glamorise

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:56.389
poverty at all, but when you're young
and you've got nothing,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.726
everything's like a positive bet,
because you got nothing to lose.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.230
And then suddenly you get given this money
and it's like, I've never had anything.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.815
You know, when I was a kid,

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.818
I lived in a tiny little bedroom
with my brother in a bunk bed,

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:12.906
and everything I owned was in a random
shelf.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.284
Like a chest of drawers that had been
taken up, just under the bed.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.119
Everything I owned was in that draw.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.996
And then suddenly someone gives you
half a million pounds.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.750
You know, I didn't have my own, you know,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.836
I'd never owned anything.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.838
I was scared of shops.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.798
I didn't know how shops worked.

00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:33.343
I'd never been in a shop.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:33.593
And then

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.596
suddenly you get half a million pounds.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:37.096
You know what?

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:37.931
What do you do?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.934
And then there's a scene in the book where
they say, buy something for your dad.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.603
And I'm like,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.854
I don't even know what that means,

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:48.316
you know, because, like,
I've never bought anything for anyone.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.609
They’re like, what does your Dad like?

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.071
I dunno he likes football,
buy him sky sports then.

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:56.157
But what they didn't know was before
I was working at the bank,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.328
I used to go with my dad to Leyton Orient
every week.

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:03.414
You know, it was £23 a year for season
ticket for kids.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.209
And we used to sit next to each other
and watch the game with Harry Samby who's

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.085
also a character in the book.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.755
But when I was working at the bank,
I didn't have time for that anymore.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.799
I was so busy.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.550
So then they think that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.888
this money is like a path for me
to bring happiness to my family.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:22.809
They don't realise that actually it’s
taking me away from my family.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:26.396
And then I would wake up on Saturdays
and I'd see my dad watching the midday

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.855
kick off on Sky Sports.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.565
And it made me so unhappy.

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:30.400
And it was just this.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.776
But it's another one of those things

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:36.155
that you just kind of compartmentalise
and you just, you hide away

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.910
the things that you losing and you focus
on the things that you winning.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.497
But, you know, I think the book, it
captures it very well, the sort of descent

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:48.876
into unhappiness and also perhaps
a sort of madness that came.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:49.669
So what do you do?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.130
I think there's this,
but it's not just me.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.008
Even though I come from a poor background,
I think there's this,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.094
that trading floor is a room
full of people who to some degree

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:02.098
have traded their happiness for money
and are trying to trade it back.

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:03.641
Yeah. And that's why you see them.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.644
They go and they buy, you know,
amazing new bike and they never ride it.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.521
They buy a whole new set of skis.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.774
They’re trying to buy back the happiness
and the youth that they've traded away.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.570
And it's a big thing
I want to get across in the book is

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.321
the sadness of this space, you know.

00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:21.492
That is a room full of very unhappy men
and very wealthy, unhappy men.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.702
And what does that mean?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.704
That we've constructed our society
in that way?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.207
There are some, as I said earlier,
fascinating characters in the book

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.292
that you worked with.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.753
And I wonder
if we could talk about a couple of them.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:32.295
The first of them

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.590
is the man who sort of frames the book 
because he's there at the beginning

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.675
and he's there right at the end as well,
which is Caleb,

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:38.593
could you tell us a little bit

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:42.013
about about Caleb
and why he's such an incredible character?

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:44.474
Yes, I mean, Caleb was kind of...

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:49.145
Caleb was the guy who ran the
trading game competition and

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.565
very smooth, charming, charismatic man.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.566
He was the youngest ever

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:57.445
managing director at Citibank,
which is like a really big deal.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.615
And he sort of comes in, he’s
this massive guy, larger than life.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.994
And he recognised very quickly, Gary’s
like really, really smart.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.245
Let's get this guy in.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:09.415
And of course, you know, I'm
just like a little kid, basically.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.000
And I see this guy
like he's the super rich trader.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.834
Like he's the guy.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.587
I want to be like this guy.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.424
And then he hires me, he brings me in, and

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.510
then very suddenly he leaves

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.387
and he sort of, he leaves.

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:26.724
Because he's, in a sense,
he's like, lived the dream.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.769
And another big theme of the book is,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.145
do you leave? Can you leave?

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.775
Do people leave? And this guy does it.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.444
And then that sort of,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.779
you know, as it develops,

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.157
it turns out that this departure
was not as simple as it seems.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:48.788
And perhaps he had appeared to be able
to leave, but he wasn't able to leave.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.374
And they sort of, you know,
I don't wanna give too much away.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:57.088
But it raises questions essentially about

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.005
appearances.

00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:00.883
This guy appeared so seductive
and so complete,

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:06.055
and yet he was unable to leave
despite being super rich.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:09.225
And this mirrors, of course,
my own journey, which my own

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:12.520
beginning of questioning,
should you leave.

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.815
And of course, that raises
bigger questions about really,

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.944
I think, the effect of money and the
effects of greed and the effects of power

00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:23.030
on the individual. And

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.033
I think we all face these questions
on some level, you know,

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:28.577
we all pursue money
and have questions about, you know,

00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:32.081
should I work harder or should I spend
more time with my family? But

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.959
he was my first ever boss and he was also
my final boss.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.502
He was not my boss the whole time.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:42.049
And our relationship went on a journey,
let's say, I don't want to give

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:45.636
too much away, but, you know,
readers can experience what I experienced.

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:45.970
Yeah.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.474
Because there is something almost mafia
like in the sort of,

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:54.770
the threat of you
not basically being able to as you say,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.065
are you going to get paid is the question
you keep asking the book.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.277
Because if you leave,
if you try to leave the job,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.362
you're your bonus
for those who don't understand

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.823
is not simply a big check that you get
and that's it.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:08.325
It's paid
incrementally over a period of time.

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:11.912
So that means if you say
I'm leaving the job, goodbye bonus.

00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:12.246
Yeah.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:13.372
So it's like, how do you get,

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.291
how do you actually get the money
that you're supposed to get?

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.002
Yeah, I wanted to,

00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:19.754
one thing
I really wanted to do with this book.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.881
I think, like I was quite lucky.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:22.840
Like from a literary

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.469
perspective, you've got a nice opportunity
because I grew up in East London,

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.472
not far from these skyscrapers,
and then I work in this space,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.766
and these two spaces
physically are not that far apart.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.601
from one another, but
they're completely different worlds right.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.562
And so you want to play with like the,

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:40.149
the contrast we go in, you know,
we talk about waking up like

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.276
and having a shower
with this little hand hose

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.944
from Argos that you plug into the taps

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:46.155
and then like going
into these massive skyscrapers

00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:47.740
and then working with these millionaires

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.495
and then going home to your, like,
crowded house and this kind of thing. But

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:52.870
you know,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.624
the opening scene of the book 
is basically me being threatened

00:06:56.624 --> 00:07:02.421
by this character Caleb and it's
very, it's very mafia esque, you know,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.257
and when I was a kid,
I come from a very poor background.

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:06.258
I grew up in a pretty rough area.

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:08.052
I was expelled from school
for selling drugs.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:08.719
You know,

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:09.136
I wouldn't say

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:12.264
I was a drug dealer, ever a criminal,
but you know, these elements existed

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.474
around me in the street I grew up,
you know.

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.267
There were drug dealers
and there were criminals.

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:18.270
I grew up with these people.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:21.941
And, you know, I did the right thing.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.608
I studied hard.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.234
I got a good job.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.361
And you kind of think that you're
you're going that way.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.364
You're choosing another path. And then

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:31.992
I quickly became very senior at Citibank
and then you suddenly see,

00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:36.330
like, when you’re doing what they want
you to do, everything's fine.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.499
As soon as you start veering, suddenly,

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:42.211
these guys are acting just like the same
way that drug dealers on the street act.

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:42.878
Right.

00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:45.881
And what I wanted to do was,

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:49.635
you know, collapse
that physical space and say, listen,

00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:52.930
these people may look very different
and they may, they may run your life

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.306
and they may have all the power.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:57.101
But once you dig a bit
beneath the surface, you know,

00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:58.352
are they any better than us?

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:01.522
Are they any, you know, and,
you know, my experience

00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:04.733
of those two spaces was, you know,

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:08.862
they're basically the same, you know,
and I think that is an empowering message,

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:09.071
you know,

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.657
to people from both sides of the coin,
which is like, you know,

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.368
if you come from a poor background, don’t
think these people are better than you

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:14.994
because they're not.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.704
And if you come from a rich background,
don't think you're

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.622
better than those people
because that can get you in trouble.

00:08:18.622 --> 00:08:21.625
You know,
and I think that's very, very relevant in

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.169
this society
we live in of increasing inequality.

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.755
You know, people who know the work
I do outside of this book will know

00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:29.383
this is something I'm very passionate
about, I think it's a massive problem.

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:32.344
One of the fascinating characters
in the book, is Billy.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.096
He's quite an enigma.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:37.933
But tell me a little bit about him
and why he was so important.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.979
So Billy was the only trader on my desk
who didn't go to university.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:46.150
And when I started working in 2008,
he was already in his mid-to-late 40s.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.736
He's from Liverpool, he's a Scouser.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:53.657
He had a strong Scouse accent and he came
from a very working class background.

00:08:53.657 --> 00:08:57.244
He started working as a teenager
on the cash desk at Halifax

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.039
and he's managed to work his way up
over the course of like 30 years

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:05.002
to being senior trader at Citibank. And

00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:06.795
when I
turn up, he's had a rough couple of years.

00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:10.841
He's not done very well and he basically
hates everyone on the trading floor.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.927
He thinks that they’re really posh,
and people are like who's this guy?

00:09:13.927 --> 00:09:16.930
Who's this dickhead basically,
because he's not making any money.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.558
But I obviously, because I see he's

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:23.312
from a sort of similar background to me.

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:24.855
I think like,
this is a guy I want to make friends with.

00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:27.941
And there's one scene really early
in the book when some guy's on another

00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:31.278
desk, he keep playing music,
and he keeps saying “turn the music down.”

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.906
They keep turning it back
on, and eventually he just pulls

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:36.909
the wires of the speakers
through the desk and just snips them.

00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:39.286
And then the guys come “What,
what’s going on!?”

00:09:39.286 --> 00:09:42.081
And then I was like,
this is the guy I wanna hang out with.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.290
But suddenly in the 2008

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.169
crisis, this guy just makes an absolute
unbelievable fortune.

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.587
And it turns out he's been sitting there

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:51.548
just betting that the world's
going to blow up for years.

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:54.343
And we formed a very close bond

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:57.346
and he sort of takes me under his wing and

00:09:57.554 --> 00:10:00.349
he kind of becomes,
I guess, a bit of a spiritual guru

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:05.312
to me in a way, and also a trading guy,
because he's a very, very good trader.

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:08.899
And after I have my first big loss,

00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:11.944
which is into my second year as a trader,

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.695
I instinctively
went back to the textbooks.

00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:16.740
I start bringing my textbooks
into the office and I'm sitting next

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.410
to Billy by this point,
I'm like Billy's junior, and

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.204
I'm reading the textbooks every day.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:24.790
After like the second or third day,
Billy just can't take it anymore.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.334
Just slaps the textbooks out of my hand
straight into the bin.

00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:29.419
He’s like “What the fuck are you doing?

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:30.379
You're not a kid anymore.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.382
You're not going to find out the key
to the world in those textbooks.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.259
If you want to know
what's happening in the world,

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:36.844
if you wanna know
what's happening in the economy,

00:10:36.844 --> 00:10:40.472
go home and ask your mum
what's happening in her economy.

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:42.307
Ask your friends, ask friend’s mums.

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:44.643
Walk down the high street
and look at what's happening.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.771
The shops are closing down, you know,

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:48.772
look at the homeless people.

00:10:48.772 --> 00:10:49.731
Is there more or less of them?

00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:51.900
You know, look at what’s
being advertised on the tube.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.195
And he basically says to me, you know,
if you want to understand the economy,

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:59.116
the time comes, you have to go out
and look at the fucking economy.

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:00.492
You can't just read about it in books.

00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:05.873
And that was a big moment for me
where it sort of, and in a sense is

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:09.042
sort of the catalyst for everything
that's happened since,

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:12.588
which is my willingness to sort of
step out of the theory and into the world

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:16.925
and that’s what propels me into becoming
the very successful trader I became.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.970
Yeah, because you had a good sense,
as you say, of what was actually happening

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.348
so that after that crash
that you mentioned, where Billy makes

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:27.811
a lot of money, everyone's
expecting for things to return to normal.

00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:28.353
Yeah.

00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.022
But your sense told you it's not.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.357
It's not going to return to normal. It's
broken.

00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:34.234
Interest rates are going to stay low.

00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:35.986
Everything's going to stay down here.

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:40.157
And that was how you made your millions,
you know, as a trader,

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:44.953
because you kept betting against
what everybody else was expecting.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:45.704
We were talking about this.

00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:48.874
If the moral deviousness is something like
Wolf of Wall Street, obviously

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:54.921
looking back now, making huge
amounts of money when you're doing it.

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:58.467
But wealth inequality, as you say,
that's what you could see.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.302
How did it feel writing about that?

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:04.890
And sort of now, obviously, you’re
an activist in terms of economics,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.769
but how does it sort of square with you
sort of having made that money

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.772
basically
off the back of a broken economy?

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:15.233
Yeah, There's this one scene in the book
which I think is quite good to say myself,

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:17.652
which is where I kind of have this penny
drop moment.

00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:19.780
I finally realised, this is it.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.615
This is what's going to happen,
which is you know,

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:25.577
I start to realise like, it's 2011, which
is the year of the sovereign debt crisis.

00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:32.125
So like all of the big governments in
Europe basically collapsed financially and

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:34.836
I start to see before this has happened,

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:36.797
like these governments
are going to go bankrupt

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:38.632
and I start to see the similarity
between them

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.592
and my friends, and my friends families

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:42.135
start losing their houses,
going into debt.

00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:44.054
And I start thinking, okay, well,

00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:46.181
almost all the ordinary people
are losing their assets,

00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:49.518
going into debt, governments are losing
their assets, are going into debt.

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:50.560
Where's it going?

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.979
And then, you know,
I'm surrounded by these millionaires.

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:56.608
Okay, what we have here
is, you know, there's a shift of power.

00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.318
There's a shift of ownership,
there's a shift of wealth.

00:12:58.318 --> 00:13:02.447
It's being drained out of the middle
class, out of governments, into the rich.

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:03.949
What the rich going to do with that?

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:06.201
They're going to buy more assets,
which means it's going to accelerate,

00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:08.620
which means that the middle class
will become completely impoverished.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.580
There'll be an explosion in poverty
in this country.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.457
Governments will be bankrupted.

00:13:12.457 --> 00:13:14.209
It's going to
you know, it's going to cause

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:15.836
basically the collapse of Western society.

00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:20.507
And then it's, there's this penny drop,
it’s like, I know what I’ve got to do.

00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:23.051
I've got to buy green Eurodollars.

00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:26.763
You look back and you're like, you know,
here is a very talented young kid.

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:28.014
He's obviously smart.

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:31.893
He's figured out a really important thing
and his instinct is: monetise.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:35.772
And that is the person
that I was trained to be.

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:36.940
That was my job.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.860
You know what I mean? So it's sort of,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.903
I think it's,

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:43.655
when I look back
I don't think about it morally.

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:45.907
I'm you know, I'm
a mathematician in my heart.

00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:48.577
I think, listen,
this is the society we've built.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.954
You know,
there are people whose job it is to manage

00:13:50.954 --> 00:13:53.957
our economy
and they get paid 50 grand a year.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:54.749
And there's people

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:58.587
whose job it is to bet on our economy,
and they get paid £2 million a year.

00:13:58.628 --> 00:13:59.004
Right.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:03.091
If that is how you can structure economy,
what do you think is going to happen?

00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:05.010
You know,
and I've walked away now from that money

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.430
and now I sort of try to prevent,
you know, economic collapse.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.267
I’m not doing the best job of it
so far. But I'm still going for it.

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.270
You know, I'm not out here trying to be
Mahatma Gandhi.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.438
I'm not a moral philosopher.

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:20.692
What I wanted to do with this book,
I didn't want to make any moral judgments.

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:26.156
You know, it's a bit like,
have you read Candide by Voltaire?

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:28.491
I think the most powerful way

00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:32.120
to show people how broken our system is
not for me to tell them it's broken.

00:14:32.203 --> 00:14:36.166
It's for me to take them with me,
take them to the places I've been,

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:40.045
take them to the top of the mountain
and show them the tsunami that's coming,

00:14:40.128 --> 00:14:42.255
you know,
and people can make their own judgments

00:14:42.255 --> 00:14:43.924
about whether it's right,
whether it's wrong.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:47.719
People who are interested
can go and look at the work that I do now.

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:48.845
They can look at my YouTube channel

00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:50.805
and I think it's pretty clear
where I stand on it.

00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:53.350
But, you know, I was a young kid.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.226
My job was to bet on the economy.

00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:56.061
And that's what I did.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.689
And it's, you know, it's not just me,
you know, the best paid

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:01.441
10,000 economists in the world.

00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:07.530
All traders, all traders,
they don't work for your governments. So

00:15:07.614 --> 00:15:09.574
that's the way the world is I'm afraid.

00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:10.450
I didn't make it that way.
