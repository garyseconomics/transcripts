00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.280
Today we are going to talk

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.520
about how you keep your house.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.880
Okay.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.720
So I wanted to do a video called

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.360
How You Keep Your House.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.120
Because the whole argument of this channel

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.880
is that we live in an economy of rapidly

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280
growing wealth inequality.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.280
And that leads to ordinary families

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.080
losing their homes, governments losing their assets,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.800
and ordinary families and governments

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.760
going further and further into debt,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.160
because those assets are going to the rich

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.120
and people are being forced to basically borrow money

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.080
back from the rich in order

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.880
to protect any asset ownership.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.360
And, this is really, really bad

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.920
specifically for the middle class, right.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.840
Because the middle class

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.200
are the group of people in society

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.120
who used to own assets and are losing their assets.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.480
But as the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.040
middle class

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.360
lose their assets to the rich and the rich

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.720
get richer

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.000
and richer and richer,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.120
because rich people like to buy assets,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.320
as the rich get richer,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.120
they bid the prices of assets up

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.200
and you get this kind of split,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
which is rich people like assets,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.080
ordinary people like goods and services.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.480
So as inequality increases,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.920
asset prices go up and wage,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.080
wage rates fall.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.680
And the middle class should hate this, right?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.280
Because they're the group of people

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.480
that own the assets.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.880
And yet sometimes when I talk to my more

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.160
middle class friends, they,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.320
they actually think it's good because what they see is

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.760
their house price is rising, stock prices are rising.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.920
You know,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.600
maybe they've got like a small like pension pot

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.680
and that's going up.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.320
So for them it's kind of like the number’s

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.120
going up, we’re good, I'm getting richer.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.760
My house price is going up.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.040
My pension pot is going up.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
So it creates this kind of like interesting,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.440
confusing thing which is happening,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.520
which is the same group of people in society

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.040
who are getting squeezed out,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.320
are kind of like cheering on their own demise,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.800
and they think they're winning because they say, well,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.120
I'm getting richer.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.680
And what I normally say to these people is, well,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680
you know, the only way for you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.440
to benefit from your house price going up

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.960
is to sell your house.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.040
And once you've sold your house,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.440
you know, in a world where housing is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.760
unbelievably expensive,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.800
then your kids will never get homes.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.160
So you're basically,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.600
you know, you're selling the family's silverware,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.800
you're going to become poor.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.840
And the only way for you to benefit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600
is to give up the most important thing

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.080
that you have, basically.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.320
And what they then sometimes say to me is,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.960
well it doesn't matter, I'm

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.040
just not going to sell the house.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.360
I'm not going to sell the house, I'm going to dig in.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.720
I'm going to keep the house.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.640
And you have this kind of perception of,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.840
I'm just going to hold onto this thing.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.440
I'm going to cling on to this asset

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.240
and I'm going to get richer, I'm

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400
going to get richer, I'm going to get richer.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.440
And they’re kind of seduced in a way,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.680
by like this rising asset value.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.920
So I wanted to do this video today

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.040
to talk about this idea of, I can keep my house

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.080
as long as I just never sell,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.640
and kind of explain why

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.320
that is basically a bad strategy

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.680
to take care of your family

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.520
in the world that we live in.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.040
And the reason for that is

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680
so if you accept that we live in this world

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.160
where inequality is increasing,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.880
and in general

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.800
the middle class is being thinned out

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.040
and the government is becoming poorer,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.880
and that wealth is instead being held by the rich.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.280
That causes a thing to happen,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.320
which is asset

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.280
prices get more and more and more expensive,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800
and the rich hold more

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.360
and more and more and more assets.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.520
But because the middle class,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.720
which is your traditional consumer, is being weakened,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.800
the cost of like basic consumption doesn't really go up

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
because that basic consumption

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.200
market is selling to ordinary people.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.680
Ordinary people are being screwed over.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.000
It's the rich who are making money,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.360
and what they want is assets.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.920
So then from the perspective of an individual

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.160
rich person, what you have is, I'm crazy, crazy rich.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.600
I have a ton of assets.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.800
The price of those assets is going through the roof.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.960
And yet the cost of regular consumption

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.680
is really, really low.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.640
And I often talk about on this channel

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.080
that rich people have like a low

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.600
marginal propensity to consume,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.240
which is they don't tend to spend a lot of the money

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.160
you give them.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.400
But as they get richer and richer and richer and richer

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.080
and the price of assets get more

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.960
and more expensive relative

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.200
to the price of consumption,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.320
these guys will start to consume more stuff.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.680
And that is when

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.080
this kind of, I'm going to keep my house,

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.040
I'm not going to sell my house person,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.440
basically starts to get screwed.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.440
And I think, I think probably the easiest way...

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.760
easiest place in which you can see it at the moment

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.360
is, for example, in elite education.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.840
So very rich people,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.440
they want to send their kids to elite universities,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.120
Oxford, Cambridge, you know, Harvard, Yale.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000
And there's only so many places at these like top,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.760
top universities

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.800
which you kind of need to get into nowadays

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.760
if you want to get one of the best paid jobs

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760
and as the rich get richer and richer and richer,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.000
it becomes quite easy for them to pay $30,000, $50,000.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.480
And, you know,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.560
rich people do frequently pay

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.720
those kinds of amounts of money per year

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.600
to send their kids to elite universities.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.160
And they can do that.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.040
They can easily do that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.160
because they're super, super, super, super rich.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.120
And it is only because in some parts of the world,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.960
the government protects ordinary people,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.680
that ordinary people don't have to do that.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.360
But as the universities can increasingly sell

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.160
a place to a rich person for 50,000 70,000 a year,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.280
inevitably that starts to squeeze up the price

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.240
that you have to pay

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680
to send your kids to an elite university.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.440
And that is when you start

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.120
to see the consequences of your strategy,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.520
which is I'm going to hold onto my house

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.840
and I'm not going to care about the fact

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.720
that the 1% is getting unbelievably rich.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.000
That's like politics of envy. Forget that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.840
Well,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.000
your kids are competing with their kids

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.800
to go to the elite universities,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.840
and if their wealth is just blowing up,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.040
then they're going to pay 50 grand a year,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.200
70 grand a year, 90 grand a year.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.440
And eventually the end result is, your kids

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.160
can’t afford to go to a good university,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.200
they can't compete with their kids for the best jobs,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.520
and then their kids are making £500,000 a year,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.040
and your kids are, you know,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.080
working for £20,000, £30,000, £40,000 a year.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.640
So it ends up in a situation where, okay,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.160
I hold onto my house, but the cost of that would be

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.960
my kids can't go to a good university,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.800
my kids can't get a good job.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.600
But it's not just the elite university market, right?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.800
So I went to a grammar school

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.560
in East London,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.400
so for people who don't know, a

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.560
grammar school is like

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.840
a free school, but it's like a slightly fancy school

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.960
and it tends to get people into better

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.680
jobs, better universities.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.760
So I went to school with a lot of kind of middle

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.040
class kids who got good degrees

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.240
and a lot of them went into medicine and dentistry.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.160
So they became doctors and dentists.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.280
And now

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.080
the doctors and dentists who make the most money,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320
what they do is

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.520
cosmetic surgery

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.600
for rich people,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.120
things like Botox or like teeth whitening,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.640
teeth straightening,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.600
cosmetic stuff

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.560
that is obviously not like medically essential.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.880
Or they work for private

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.240
healthcare, healthcare for rich people.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.160
And, you know, that's who cares about that.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.200
That's politics of envy.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.240
Well, what happens when you need a dentist?

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.880
What happens when your kids need a dentist?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.160
And we're in a situation now in this country

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.600
where it's becoming increasingly impossible

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.760
to get a NHS dentists

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.880
to get cheaper, affordable dental care.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.840
And as a result,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.120
people are just not going to the dentist.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.120
And it's not that the dentists are not there.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.320
It is that

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.120
just like your kids are in competition

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.320
with the kids of the rich for elite

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.680
university places,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.440
you and your kids are in competition

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.440
with the rich for access to the dentists

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.440
and access to the doctors.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.120
So you're there.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.360
You're thinking, I'm going to keep my house.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.160
I'm going to keep my house.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.000
I'm going to keep my house.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.560
Who cares if they're getting rich?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.600
That's politics of envy, that's politics of envy.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.760
And then they've out competed for university.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.280
Your kids can't go to university.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.520
They've out competed for a dentist.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.200
Now kids don’t have a dentist.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.720
They've outcompeted you for the doctors.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.320
And now you can't get access to healthcare.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.680
What I'm trying to say is, it's a very unwise strategy

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.040
to hold onto your house like it's your baby

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.440
and just watch the price of the house going up

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.640
while you and your class are being rapidly outcompeted

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.840
for all of the things that you need

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.960
by this one other group of society.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.560
Because of course,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.680
nobody can force you to sell your house, but they can

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.320
take all of the other things that you need

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.680
and eventually are going to be put in a situation

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.600
where the only way to get a basic,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.560
just the basics of living is to sell, sell your house.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.600
And the most obvious example of

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.040
this is when you look at equity releases schemes.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.880
So the people who don't know

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.920
what equity release schemes are,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.560
you'll see these advertised.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.720
If you’re ever watching daytime TV,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.400
you'll see them advertised on TV.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.000
And my grandparents all owned property,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.360
but they never died with property

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.320
because they used these equity release schemes.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.280
And these equity release

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.840
schemes are basically saying, look,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.520
we'll let you keep your house.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.320
You can live in a house till you die,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.960
but we'll give you money during your retirement.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.360
And then when you die, the house is ours.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.400
And what you're seeing here is...

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.680
I think that the best example is during Covid.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.240
I've spoken about this a lot on the channel.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.880
We gave an enormous amount of money out,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.000
and that money ended up with richer people.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.160
And a lot of people were like,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.480
well it doesn’t matter if the rich get money.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.520
You know, who cares if the rich get money?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.240
I think there's a quote by Peter Mandelson

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.520
who says, I'm intensely relaxed

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.560
about the rich getting rich.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.400
If the rich get rich,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.720
they will start to consume more stuff,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.960
and some of that stuff will be stuff that you need

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.160
and some of the obvious repercussions

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.120
of that were, you know,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.080
rents in London went absolutely crazy.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920
If you give a tonne of money to rich people,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.600
of course, rents in London will go crazy.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.960
They'll give that money to their kids.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.120
The kids will buy houses.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.520
The kids

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.560
won’t need to share, they won’t need to take flatmates

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.120
because they'll be really, really rich.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.000
There's less housing and the rents will go up.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.440
You know, the rents don't go up out of nowhere.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.280
Somebody is paying them.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.480
The rich people are paying them.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.800
So you see them, they squeeze you out of,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.120
they squeeze you out of education,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.000
they squeeze of healthcare, the squeeze out of housing.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.720
You know,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.640
we were talking earlier today about

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.160
the potato famine in Ireland,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.960
and there were also famines in India

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.000
during British rule.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.080
And at the time that there were famines in India

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.600
and millions of people were dying

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.400
because of lack of access to food.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.320
There were enormous

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.840
fields, farms in India growing tea,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.920
which was shipped to England.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.080
So farms that could be going

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.640
food, are growing tea,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.000
an inedible luxury crop to be sent to England

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.640
while people, local people, are starving,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.480
dying, you know.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.840
It doesn't matter if you keep your house

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.320
because eventually the rich are going to outcompete you

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.560
for education, for health care, for housing.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.800
And at the end of the day, for food and energy.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.760
And know when we talk about these

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.240
old ladies who are using equity release schemes,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.680
you know, in

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.560
many cases,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.360
these are old ladies

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.240
who are using those equity release schemes

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.320
to heat their homes while they're 80 years old.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.760
And, you know,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.880
why is it that the energy price has doubled?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.840
You know, who's using the energy?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.360
Rich people. Rich people don't keep the heating off.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.360
You know, if you allow these people

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.520
to get richer and richer and richer,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.880
they will consume more.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.320
You will consume less.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.160
And eventually you'll be forced to sell your house.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.000
It doesn't work.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.120
So I guess the point I'm trying to make here is

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.520
it's very shortsighted

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.920
to think that you are winning

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.480
when house prices go up

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.720
just because you are keeping your house,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.560
when everyone around you,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.640
your class, people like you, people

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.520
in the same financial situation

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.360
as you, are losing their houses

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.560
and a small section of society that you are not in

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.240
is taking everything.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.560
You know,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.600
the wealth of the rich will grow and grow and grow.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.680
If you don't stop that, eventually you lose everything.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.880
You know, it's a little bit like,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.720
you know, if you play chess,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.520
you only lose a game of chess, if you lose your king.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.680
So if we're playing chess

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.320
and you're taking one of my pieces

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.200
every single day

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.680
and I'm just like, well, that's not my king.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.760
That's not my king, that's not my king.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.600
You know,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.800
you need to protect your competitive position.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.600
You need to protect your competitive position.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.920
There's this French film

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.000
La haine, talks about a man who jumps off a skyscraper.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.080
And as he was falling,

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.480
keeps saying to himself, so far, so good.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.680
So far, so good.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.760
So far, so good.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.440
Yes, I know house prices are going up

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.720
and house prices are going up

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.240
because the rich are getting richer

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.840
and richer and richer.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.400
That is not...

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.280
an increase in wealth

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.800
inequality is not an abstract thing.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.360
It is a transfer of wealth

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.520
away from the middle class,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.720
which most of the viewers will be in

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.680
towards the super rich.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.560
It looks good because your house is going up.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.240
The end result is

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.520
the only way you can keep

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.120
that house is by slowly

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.360
giving up every single one of the things that you need,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.600
and that guarantees poverty, basically.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.480
So the end of the video, how to keep your house.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.600
The way to keep your house,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.680
if you are a middle class person,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.920
is to protect the middle class

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.360
from the rapidly growing wealth of the rich.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.320
You have to stop that flow.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.040
You have to stop that flow like you can't sit there.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.840
You know, it's like you, you know,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.800
you're like one part of the bathwater

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.480
watching the bathwater go down the drain.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480
You're like, well, my part's not down the drain yet.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.400
You can't, if there is a...

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.560
if you exist in a society

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.360
where there is an aggressive

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.440
flow of wealth

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.640
away from the middle class

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.960
towards the rich, and you are in the middle class,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.840
you have to stop the flow.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.560
You have to stop the flow.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.840
And I think there's a really like kind of

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.400
beautiful parallel in this

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.000
where you have,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.040
we have a new government in the country,

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.120
a Labour government,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.600
that is watching wealth like flood

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.440
out of the government towards the rich.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.600
And they're just like, well,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.880
if we a little bit more sensible,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.560
if you manage just a little bit better,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.920
then we can fix things.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.840
And then it turns out

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.320
they actually don't have any money to do anything.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.760
What the government are doing

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.320
is exactly the same as a middle class person.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:36.960
It's like,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.480
you're existing in a situation,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.840
you're obviously losing,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.040
you're obviously dying,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.360
your wealth is flooding away, and you are

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.920
stupidly, stubbornly resistant

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.600
to doing anything to stop that flow.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.800
And then you're surprised when it leads you to poverty.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.440
The way to keep your house

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.040
is to protect your class as a group.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.680
If your class dies, if your group dies,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.760
you die as well.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.000
You need to fight back against that.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.560
You need to protect the middle class from the rich.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.280
If you don't do that, the rich eat the middle class,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.560
then there's no middle class.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.600
And if you want to know what a country looks like

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.800
with no middle class, go to Mexico.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.560
Go to Colombia, go to Nigeria,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.680
go to India, go to South Africa.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.280
It's poverty for the many.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.280
The only way to stop that

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.920
tax the super rich, lower tax on ordinary people.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.160
You have to fight back.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.480
You have to protect yourself.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.640
Otherwise you lose everything.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.120
You keep your house

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.840
by working together and protecting your people.
