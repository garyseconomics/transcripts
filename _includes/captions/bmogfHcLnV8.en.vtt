00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.740
I'm what's given me hope previously is when&nbsp;
you mentioned things can change and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.460
you pointed to post World War II as a time where&nbsp;
there was change and just now you've mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.460
that 100 years ago housing was just an inheritable&nbsp;
asset, was it just that post World War II&nbsp;period&nbsp;

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.380
that changed that? how did&nbsp;we go
from that to post world war 2?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm an economist I'm not like a super expert&nbsp;
in history but you know this is obviously my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
particular area of interest is um what I find&nbsp;
what is quite interesting is after the World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.060
War II you saw a big increase in tax rates on the&nbsp;
very reach not just in the UK but really globally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.020
um and you'd seen that just before World&nbsp;
War II happen in the US with uh FDR&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
Franklin Roosevelt with the New Deal deciding&nbsp;
we're going to push money to ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.200
um so I think what happened was you know and you&nbsp;
know different people can disagree with this but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.520
you know second order obviously we didn't do the&nbsp;
second world but second world war was a period&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.100
where basically the whole of Europe devoted its&nbsp;
entire economy to building tanks and planes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
bombs and destroying everything and killing&nbsp;
everyone and just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the country up right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.560
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the whole of Europe up right yeah at the&nbsp;
same time if you were in the England in World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.060
War II or Germany I'm not at all saying these are&nbsp;
perfect places to live they still made sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.660
everyone had housing education and Healthcare&nbsp;
right and food all right that was so people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.180
saw during World War II that okay we can devote&nbsp;
our entire economy to killing each other and yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.240
still make sure everyone has housing education&nbsp;
Healthcare and food and I think people sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.940
it opened people's eyes a little bit to sort&nbsp;
of number one what is possible in our economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.520
and number two how awful things can be if you&nbsp;
don't manage it you know what I mean like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.900
what I say you know I know it's not popular to&nbsp;
be political but if you're a student of History&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.340
you see what happens to poor people when they're&nbsp;
not political you know it wasn't the rich guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.740
you know sending their kids out to die you know it&nbsp;
was poor people you know and I think they sort of

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.080
I think once you've you know I've never obviously&nbsp;
fought in a war right but I think once you've done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.460
that you start realizing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me we need&nbsp;
to change the way we run our society right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.900
and then people came back from that and they&nbsp;
said no we we're not going to accept this this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.260
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know we want we want [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] housing&nbsp;
food Healthcare education for everyone and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.640
know you can afford it we know we can afford&nbsp;
that as a society so they so you saw basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.120
every country in Europe simultaneously&nbsp;
basically politically demand those things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.260
um and we moved to a space where the top rate of&nbsp;
income tax was 95 and the top rate of inheritance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.540
tax was 90 and you know we moved into an&nbsp;
economy where people like my dad who didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.100
go to university worked with the post office&nbsp;
goodbye a home and raise a family and have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.460
food you know not be rich but you could have that&nbsp;
level of stability um and I think what it shows is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.900
the power of political Unity amongst poorer&nbsp;
people and this is this is what I keep saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.140
right if you demand it if you absolutely demand&nbsp;
it that inequality gets better and wealth flows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.800
to ordinary families then you will get it and the&nbsp;
reason we don't get it is because you know we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.140
media and politics which is very heavily&nbsp;
influenced by extremely wealthy people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.040
tell you stories like oh no if we text rich&nbsp;
people the economy will collapse the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.500
people will leave it will be a disaster you know&nbsp;
don't worry about your kids they'll stop buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.960
cappuccinos and they'll be fine you know media&nbsp;
tells you this story that everything is okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.300
and you don't need to do anything at the same time&nbsp;
ordinary families get poorer and poorer and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.500
guys who own the media I get richer and richer&nbsp;
right so it's the power of stories you know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.500
you know I know that the story that I sell is very&nbsp;
negative because I say if you don't do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.760
and we're not doing anything we're not doing&nbsp;
enough we're not United enough life will get worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.320
that's not a very palatable message right whereas&nbsp;
you know Rupert Murdoch is going to tell you in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.820
the times that don't worry your kids will be fine&nbsp;
as long as they stop buying avocado on toast right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.920
which is a lie but it's much nicer to believe that&nbsp;
than the truth of the situation which is that your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.640
kids aren't going to be up to four 12 grandkids&nbsp;
you know what I mean so I think history shows us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.180
you know in general when Ordinary People are not&nbsp;
politicized they get screwed over over time you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.600
know because the rich are politicized because they&nbsp;
have the money and the power and the time to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.020
um but eventually when things get bad enough&nbsp;
people realize [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me we need to be politicized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.040
because otherwise this is what happens you know&nbsp;
you know both my granddads went and fought in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.520
the War and probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] killed people you know&nbsp;
what I mean I've got no idea what that is like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.040
know but that is hell right I think you witnessed&nbsp;
that that makes you realize [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.960
change things and that is you know obviously we're&nbsp;
not at that point now but you know things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.860
getting worse and things are getting serious and&nbsp;
that that is an example of how bad things can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.720
if ordinary working people are not politicized to&nbsp;
defend themselves and I think one thing that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.200
saw in the last couple of weeks with the back down&nbsp;
and the 45 tax for the riches that created a risk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.840
to the mortgages to people's mortgages and it's&nbsp;
wealthier people that have big mortgages poorest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.380
people can't get mortgages at all right and a lot&nbsp;
of them work in the media and a lot of them work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.660
in politics and you see these people turn around&nbsp;
and said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this we're not accepting it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.160
you see this conservative party switch like that&nbsp;
and that is because you know that upper middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.980
class have political power and they use it you&nbsp;
know they work they might not own the newspapers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.100
but they work in the newspapers you know they&nbsp;
might not own the TV stations but they work in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.420
TV stations whereas this sort of poorer 70 percent&nbsp;
they do have political power but they often don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.540
use it and that is I'm not blaming them for&nbsp;
that because I'll come from that background&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.900
and I know what it's like you just want to make&nbsp;
sure you're taken care of and it's difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.940
but it's like I say you know there's a political&nbsp;
game being played here for wealth for power for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.460
assets and if you don't play it you're going to&nbsp;
lose it and you know the bottom 70 they don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.600
a lot of money they don't have a lot of assets but&nbsp;
they have a lot of people so the only Power they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.340
have is their voting power their power to tell&nbsp;
stories their power to build community but if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.000
don't use that they'll lose their assets then like&nbsp;
it's worth so I think um history shows up shows us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.380
it's possible but it's only possible why people&nbsp;
coming together and sometimes it takes extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.960
bad situations for people to do that I don't want&nbsp;
it to get to that this time I want us to prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.000
those extremely bad situations from happening&nbsp;
but if we if we don't that's where we'll end up
