00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.440
Today we are going to talk about

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.320
why Labour and Trump will both fail.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.480
So we are in a situation now

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.800
where we have new governments

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.840
in both the UK and the US.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.280
And on the face of it, you have two very different

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.080
political parties, two very different leaders.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.160
We have one

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.880
center left party, one right

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.800
wing party with a very right wing leader,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.280
and they both have very different

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.480
sets of economic policies.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.000
What we're going to explain today

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.040
is how both of these parties, despite

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.160
having very different sets of policies, will fail.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.120
And we're going to talk about what

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520
that teaches us about economics

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.760
and the left and the right of politics today.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.840
So I think it's important to recognise

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.600
that both of these governments have come into power

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.600
at a situation where the economy has weakened a lot.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.040
There have been significant falls in living standards,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.680
and there has been a real significant loss of faith

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.240
from the general public in the economic status

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.400
quo and politics in general.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.640
This means that both of these parties,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
both of these leaders, have come into power

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.720
needing to offer something new, a kind of new idea

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.200
on economics and a new idea on politics.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.880
And what we can learn from

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.440
these two parties is basically

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680
what the main new pitches are,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.120
and where the economy needs to go.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.040
Okay, let's start with Labour.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.560
Now, the Labour economic policy,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.400
I think of it as a kind of managed centrism

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.560
or a managed sensible-ism.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.480
And when I say sensible-ism,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.560
I don't mean to say that I think it is actually

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.000
a good or a sensible policy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.720
In reality,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.840
I think Labour’s economic policy will fail quite badly.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.560
I think it will lead to significantly

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.120
falling living standards.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.600
But I call it a sensible-ism

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.520
because it's important to understand

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.080
that it is basically rooted in

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.600
what is kind of considered

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.160
the sensible economic policy

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.200
of mainstream modern economists.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.160
Economists love this kind of policy,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.040
but also the way that it’s implemented

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.320
and the way that it's presented

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.600
seems to be really rooted in this idea that Labour,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840
and Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves view themselves

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.280
as extremely sensible economically.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.360
So let's talk about what the actual policy is.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720
So this managed sensible-ism

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.880
is basically the idea that you do

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.640
everything but a little bit more of it.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640
So you borrow a bit more,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280
you tax a bit more,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520
you spend a bit more and crucially,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.680
you use that money to invest a little bit more.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.160
So I think you can already see how sensible-ism

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
is, like a very key part of how this idea views itself.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920
And this managed sensible-ism

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.760
is rooted

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.160
in this idea that has been popular

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.880
amongst economists for a long time,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360
that there is a productivity puzzle

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.160
or a productivity problem

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
in Western economies, but in particular the UK economy.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.280
I might do a video specifically about that puzzle

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800
because I think it's kind of nonsense.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.720
But to make it clear,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.960
this basically comes down to the UK economy,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.080
like a lot of Western economies,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.960
but in particular the UK economy has really not grown

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.760
very much for a long time.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.040
And economists

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920
and the Labour Party

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.960
basically say, you want to grow more,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.160
what you need is to invest more.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.000
So our plan is to borrow a bit more, tax a bit more,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.600
use that money to invest,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.280
and we're going to grow the economy.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.960
And this kind of ties into the idea

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.520
that we've had a conservative government for 14 years.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.040
They were largely an austerity government.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.680
They tried to save a lot of money.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.040
They didn't really invest in the country.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.360
So there's this idea going around

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.480
that we have crumbling infrastructure.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.440
So we need to raise a bit of money

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.800
and use that money to invest

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.440
in growing our infrastructure.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.200
So this policy, it sounds really sensible, right.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.640
We're going to raise a little bit of money.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.680
We're going to invest.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.720
Investment is great.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.360
Economists love investment.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.280
We're going to grow, we're going to grow the economy.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.800
And we're going to fix all of our problems this way.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800
So if it's so great sounding, if it's so sensible,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.120
why is it going to fail?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.720
Well, I think the first and most obvious way

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.160
that we can see

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.080
this policy is probably going to fail is because

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.360
America, and in fact recently Germany,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.720
already tried it.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.240
They already tried this policy and did it work?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.800
Did it work in those countries.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.200
So obviously in the US,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.320
we had the Democrats under Joe Biden in power

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.560
for the last four years,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.240
and they basically went pretty aggressively

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.840
into this kind of policy.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.400
In particular they borrowed a lot of money,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.480
they spent a lot of money,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.680
and they tried to do a lot of investment.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.000
Did it work?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.320
On the one hand,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.320
the US has had higher levels of GDP growth,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.800
much higher than the UK,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.400
significantly higher than most Western countries

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.120
in the last four years.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.320
In the...

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.800
On the other hand,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.480
they got pretty badly beaten in the election,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.880
which gives a good sense

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.800
that the general public is not happy

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.280
with the policy or with the government.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.480
This kind of raises like an interesting question.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.720
There's

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.680
this idea that has been going around,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.760
in particular in the American media

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.880
a lot in the last couple of years.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.640
There's a phrase which is the vibes are off.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.440
I don't think I've spoken

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.560
about this phrase on the channel.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.720
I kind of love this phrase

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.320
because it tells you kind of everything

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.400
about modern economics today.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.280
So the vibes are off.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.800
Is an idea popular

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.840
in American economics, the economic press,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.760
which is that

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.840
the economy is actually really, really strong.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.200
And because of the strength of the economy,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.880
it doesn't make any sense

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.040
that the public are so unhappy.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.240
And the actual problem is just that

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.800
the public is somehow picking up on

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.640
some, like, negative vibes.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.040
And the reason for this is something

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.280
which I speak about a lot on this channel, which is

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.400
economists,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.360
they love to look at these kind of big

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.920
macro aggregate measures of the economy.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.040
So in the last few years,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.400
GDP growth has been quite good in the US.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.080
Unemployment has been quite low

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.960
and inflation has been falling.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.000
So from the perspective of an economist,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.960
they're looking at this

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.120
and they're saying oh the economy's good.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.680
The economy is good.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.720
What you need to understand is most economists,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.760
especially most influential

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.720
economists,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.440
are rich people from rich families

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.920
with elite degrees and well-paid jobs.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.200
So what these guys are seeing

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.320
is, you know,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.760
good top level numbers,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.600
GDP growth, inflation, unemployment,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.240
they themselves, their personal financial position,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.920
their family's financial position, their community’s

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.720
financial position is doing really well.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.320
And they don't really see the fact

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.960
that increasingly in the last three,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.040
four years,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.720
your average American,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.120
just like your average English or British person,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.400
is increasingly struggling

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.200
to pay the rent, pay the bills,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.960
in many cases even pay for things

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.120
like food and heating.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.560
And this basically

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.520
is the same problem

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.760
that I talk about a lot on this channel.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.200
Economists just look at the big picture numbers.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.840
They themselves are rich.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.000
They don't see that as inequality rises quickly,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.840
it is possible for the rich to do very well,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.680
whilst the poor

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.600
fall deeper and deeper and deeper into poverty.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.440
And Labour are making this exact

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.560
same mistake, basically.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.080
They will focus exclusively on the economy

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.160
and growth, GDP,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
all of these large big picture numbers.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.880
But we are sitting here in 2025

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.840
just after Covid,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.160
which saw an absolutely unbelievable,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.080
enormous increase in wealth inequality.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.240
If you don't deal with that, then living standards

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.640
will continue to fall for the poor

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.600
and for ordinary people.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.320
You simply have to deal

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.440
with the growing inequality of wealth.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.680
You know,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.840
living standards were falling for ordinary people

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.440
even before Covid

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.400
because they were increasingly unable

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.280
to compete with the rich for resources.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.240
Since Covid, inequality is much worse.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.160
This is what I've made my money on.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.040
This is what I made my history on.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.800
The situation is much worse now.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.120
If Labour don't look at it,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.240
they will make the exact same mistake that Biden made,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.160
that the Democrats made,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.120
which is essentially

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.360
you are in a situation now

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.520
where the rich are much, much, much richer.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.120
They are sucking wealth out

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.680
like a black hole of the middle class

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.600
and the government extremely quickly.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.320
This will lead to falling living standards.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.240
The second thing to say is that,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.280
you know, there is a kind of a naive assumption here

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.240
that the government can simply invest.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.120
And you see this idea often in media coverage

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.040
that says the government should just build houses,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.760
the government should just build houses.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.480
The resources which your government needs to invest,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.320
the resources

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.960
which your government needs to build houses,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.040
are already owned by rich people.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.800
You cannot build those houses,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.680
you cannot make those investments

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.360
unless you get those resources.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.440
Now we have a government here in the UK,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.640
which is unfortunately very, very resistant

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640
to the taxation of rich people,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.200
which means their whole plan

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.960
is to either borrow from the rich,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.640
which, as we saw last month,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.000
could potentially be very, very difficult,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
or to raise taxes on you.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.640
So the government has raised taxes slightly,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.880
but the main tax they raised

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.960
was tax National insurance,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.800
which is a tax on working people.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800
They haven't done really anything at all

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.840
significantly to raise taxes on the rich.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.360
So what you see here is a government

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.680
that is faced with a massive,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.320
massive increase

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.080
in inequality, a massive, massive loss of resources

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.040
for working people, for the government,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.440
and rather than addressing

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.160
tax policy

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.000
to get the resources back,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.120
they're trying to borrow it back, which in many cases

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.280
it looks like they possibly can't do,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.560
and they're taxing you instead.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.080
The UK government is in a

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.880
much weaker position than the US government

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.960
when it comes to borrowing.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.200
This means that they are not able

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.720
to do the same amount of borrowing,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.400
investing that Joe Biden did,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.920
and even that led to him

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.760
really significantly losing the next election.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.120
So essentially, Labour are extremely blind

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.480
to the problem of inequality and distribution,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.720
and they are kind of rehashing a policy

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.320
that they've already seen fail in America,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.640
only they're doing it with much, much less money.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.400
Unfortunately, this will fail.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.360
Okay, now on to Donald Trump.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.280
The first thing I want to say

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.880
is, it's

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.760
actually not easy to know

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.400
exactly what Donald Trump will do

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.920
when it comes to the economy.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.800
For the reason that I explained in my recent video,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.720
Truth, Lies &amp; Gains,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.760
which is basically that

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.080
what Donald Trump says he is going to do is often not

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.720
particularly connected to what Donald Trump wants to do

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.760
or what Donald Trump intends to do.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.120
But obviously,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.200
we should look at and consider

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000
and talk about the two economic policies

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.600
which he speaks about most,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.080
which are tariffs and reducing immigration.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.600
Now, both of these policies are really popular

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.440
because they sound very America first.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.360
Now, we’re obviously living in a time

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.360
when the economy is very weak for ordinary people.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.160
People are worried,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.920
people are scared,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.000
and people want their leaders to protect them.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.120
And for that reason,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.960
these kind of anti-immigration policies

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.520
are increasingly very popular all over the world

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.160
because they make people feel like at last,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.920
our leaders are coming here to protect me,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.480
our leaders are coming here to protect us.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.880
They're not worrying about foreigners.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.120
How do I know it's not going to work on the economy?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.440
Well, we can do a similar thing here

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.720
to what we just did when analysing Labour.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.160
So when Labour came in, they’re

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.360
kind of replicating the economic plans of

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.360
the American government that were going out,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.760
and Trump is doing a similar thing

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.280
with regards to his rhetoric on immigration,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.760
that the Conservative government did for a long time.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.720
So the Conservative government really,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.920
really aggressively spoke

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.480
about wanting to reduce immigration.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.120
They made it kind of one of their flagship policies.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.760
They leant really heavily into Brexit,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.200
which was, of course, to a significant...

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.680
to a significant degree about reducing immigration.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.920
And yet when they came in,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.480
they actually didn't reduce immigration at all.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.760
In fact, they significantly increased immigration.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.320
So why does this happen?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.680
You know,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.720
I think it's pretty clear to see why this happens.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.400
This is a very popular rhetoric.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.720
It's very,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.480
very popular to say we're going to reduce immigration.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.560
Lots of people want immigration to be reduced.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.520
But when the Conservatives actually come into power,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.080
you know,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.640
I’d love to have them on, if you want to discuss it,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.720
but I think what happens is you sit down,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.120
you look at it and you realise

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.560
actually some pretty important sections of our economy

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.640
have basically

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640
been built

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.880
at this point to be extremely dependent on immigration.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.360
So in the UK you have three sectors of the economy

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.720
which are like really, really,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.640
really extremely depend on immigration,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.120
which are the NHS,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.120
care for elderly people and the universities.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.360
And all of these sectors

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.800
are basically completely depends

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.080
on immigrants at the moment.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.880
So I think the Conservatives come in,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.680
they kind of sell,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.080
we've really, really sold ourselves

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.960
on reducing immigration.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.480
We've done Brexit,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.000
but actually

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.400
these three really important sectors of the economy

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.120
basically won't work if we reduce immigration.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.080
So then they end up in this kind of situation

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.240
where they need to play this game of really,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.080
really, really aggressively

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.480
acting like and saying they want to reduce immigration

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.360
whilst not actually reducing immigration

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.320
because it would damage these sectors of the economy.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.640
I don't want to say you can't reduce immigration,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.280
but you need to be really careful

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.520
and strategic about how you do it.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.240
So in the US,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.960
there are also a lot of sectors of the economy

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.520
which have become very dependent on migrant labour.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.840
I think in the US it's

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.280
things like agriculture, a lot of...

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.080
a lot of low paid work,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.600
and you could reduce immigration and try and replace

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.840
these workers with domestic workers.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.680
But you need to do the prep work

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.280
beforehand to make sure

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.320
that you have the workers available.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.760
And I'm not sure Donald Trump has done that prep work.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.320
I think he's going to find himself in a very,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.440
very similar situation to the Conservatives, basically.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.360
Where he finds that

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.680
what you need to say to get into power

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.640
is very, very difficult

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.440
to what you need to do to keep the economy running.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.640
And he is probably going to be forced

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.800
into a similar situation

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.680
of talking very hard on immigration,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.400
whilst not actually doing a lot on it,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.520
because he hasn't done the prep work

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.280
to make sure that the workers are there

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.040
for the sectors

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.920
that have become dependent on these workers.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.120
And tariffs are essentially the same thing.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.400
You know,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.680
I think tariffs are actually potentially

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.640
an interesting policy.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.120
And if you

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.080
go back through history,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.360
you will see that a lot of countries

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.360
have had a lot of success in the past with tariffs.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.640
Countries like Japan and South Korea

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.200
and Taiwan successfully built themselves up

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.240
in the 20th century

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.880
by using tariffs to protect certain industries.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.240
Even countries like the UK

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.920
and the US themselves have used tariffs

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.520
a lot at points in their history.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.800
And when you live in a world where you are competing

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.000
with extremely unequal countries

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.280
like China, like India,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.440
China is still much more unequal than the West,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.960
that have much lower levels of wages.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.200
Tariffs can be used to protect your domestic economy,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.400
to protect your domestic worker.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.360
But again, you have

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.680
just like with immigration, you have this problem.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.400
Do we have the industries

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.720
ready here

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.800
to produce the products which we're going to lose

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280
when we bring the tariffs in?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.000
And I think tariffs can work

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.480
when they are targeted at specific industries

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.440
where you are being outcompeted by

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.360
foreign companies with cheaper labour.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.640
I don't think they work when they're applied

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.800
really broadly to basically everything.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.960
If you apply them across the board,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.760
even in spaces

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.360
where you don't have the domestic industry

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.400
available to replace those tariffed imports,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.280
all you end up doing is really increasing prices,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.760
really increasing costs.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.720
This ends up hitting the poorest the most

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.840
because they spend a much

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.040
higher percentage of their money

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.480
on basic goods and services.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.040
And it would actually really,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.200
if it was not targeted,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.240
and if it was not carefully done,

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240
it would really, really,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.720
actually hurt living standards.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.960
So I think Trump is going to find himself

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.400
basically just like the Conservatives

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400
in this situation

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.680
where he knows that

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.440
these policies, he's shouted loudly for,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.080
reducing immigration, increasing tariffs, are basically

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.800
not really workable from an economic perspective,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.200
and he will have to constantly back down

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.560
from them in certain ways.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.680
And I suspect in the end,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.000
he probably won't go through with really implementing

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.440
either of these policies in a very...

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.480
in the kind of large scale he's promised.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.240
But if he's simply not going to do the policies

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.000
which he says he's going to do,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.240
how can I say the economy will fail?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.680
The answer is, quite simply, tax policy.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.960
There is one area

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.360
where I think I can confidently predict

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360
what Trump will do,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.400
because he did it last time

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.560
and he looks convinced to do it again.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.880
And it's very in the interests

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.960
of both himself and Elon Musk,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.000
who appears to be backing him financially.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.960
He will significantly reduce taxes on rich people,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.840
and he will fund that probably by

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.040
slashing government spending in some cases,

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.960
which will often cause

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.320
a lot people to lose their jobs, cause

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.840
a lot of people to lose support.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.440
And he will fund it by raising taxes

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.640
on ordinary working people.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.680
Let's assume even if he

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.800
didn't raise taxes on working people.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.120
Is it a problem if Donald Trump massively

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.920
slashes taxes on rich people?

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.960
How does that affect ordinary

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.360
people's living standards?

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.360
Okay, I've said this a million times on the channel,

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.160
but I am going to go through it

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.480
really clearly for you again,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.040
because it is really, really important

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.400
when you are considering Donald Trump's policy

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.400
to slash taxes on the rich.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.960
When rich people get an enormous amount of money

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.080
that is bad for you,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.960
that is bad for your living standards,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.440
I'll explain why.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.560
Money is not a real resource, okay? Money is not food.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.800
Money is not housing.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.200
Money is a competitive resource.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.360
Money is a distributional resource.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.480
Money is the resource that we use to determine

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.480
the allocation of the real resources.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.880
If rich people get an enormous amount of money,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.120
they will use that money to buy the things you need.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.000
They will outcompete you and your children for housing.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.400
House prices will go up.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.040
Your kids will not be able to afford a house.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.800
That means they will rent for longer.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.120
That means they will have to borrow money

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.560
from the rich to buy houses,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.520
they will pay more interest, okay.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.920
Once the rich have more assets,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.040
inequality will be higher

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.480
and they will start to use more of the consumption

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.800
goods.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.840
They will use more land, they will use more food,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.800
they will use more energy,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.400
they will use more goods and services.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.400
And you will get less of these things.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.320
Listen, I know inequality...

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.400
I know economists don't talk about inequality much.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.280
That's the reason why I am a multi-millionaire.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.040
And most economists are not because I made my money

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.640
by understanding that inequality hurts the economy.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.760
If you've not watched it yet

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.440
and you don't understand the argument

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.680
I've been making for a long time,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.640
that inequality hurts your living standards,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.680
I really recommend

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.160
you watch the first video on this channel.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.760
I opened this channel

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.920
because I saw at the beginning of Covid

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.440
that governments were going to give out

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.920
enormous amounts of money.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.200
That money would go to the rich,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.280
and that would cause a collapse

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.320
in your living standards. That has happened.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.120
I predicted that in June 2020

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.920
because I understand

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.840
that inequality affects living standards.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.800
Of course, the distribution affects living standards.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.720
Donald Trump

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.000
will oversee a massive cut in the tax of rich people,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and that will make your living standards worse.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.760
That is how I know

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.720
that Donald Trump will fail in the economy

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.480
for the same reason I know

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.640
that Keir Starmer and Labour will fail in the economy.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.520
Because both of these governments,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.640
both of these leaders, despite in theory

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.720
sitting on opposite

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.400
sides of the political spectrum,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.960
will oversee a continued increase in inequality,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.080
which will lead to a continued decrease

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.120
in living standards,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.600
just like Obama did,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.360
just like David

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.640
Cameron did, just like Boris Johnson did,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.960
just like George Bush did

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.360
all of these presidents

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.160
and prime ministers, be they red or blue,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.320
all of your leaders

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.160
have overseen a rise in inequality,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.680
and that is why your living standards are falling.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.760
And that is why your kids

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.480
and your grandkids will be poor.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.200
The message that I want to give here

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.080
is stop worrying about all of this

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.480
red blue, red blue bull***t, okay?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.240
It's red blue, red blue, red, blue.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.960
And every single time

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.880
you get poorer and your kids get poorer,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.080
and the politicians

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.760
and the wealthy people who fund them

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.720
get richer and richer and richer and richer.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.720
Stop arguing about the right left

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.800
bull***t and start protecting your resources.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.960
Start protecting your wealth.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.040
Follow the money.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.160
Follow the money.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.640
Who is getting richer? Who is getting poorer?

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.080
Whose taxes are going up?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.520
Whose taxes are going down?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.680
Who is finding it harder to buy a house?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.920
Who is buying 10 or 20 houses?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.080
Follow the money. Look at the distribution.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.080
This is what matters to protect

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.400
the financial position of your kids and your grandkids.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.920
Listen, you are losing your wealth.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.520
What you have

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.560
here is a massive boat with a hole in the bottom,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.640
and one group of people

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.520
is telling you to row more sensibly

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.720
and another group is telling you

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.840
to kick out the foreigners

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.560
while you and your family

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.120
and your community are hemorrhaging your wealth

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.600
to those people and the people that fund them,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.120
you're bleeding to death here.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.040
Donald Trump is an extremely wealthy

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.160
man, funded by the richest man in the world.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.840
Keir Starmer is a rich man

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.560
funded by a very wealthy man.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.720
These guys are getting richer, okay.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.840
It’s you guys who are getting poorer.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.520
You need to protect your position.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.720
I want to end this by addressing a question

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.360
that I've gotten a lot in the last couple of weeks.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.480
I spent the last couple of weeks

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.880
traveling up and down the UK a couple of times,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.400
talking to groups of people all around the country.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.640
And a lot of people asked me,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.720
if you were Chancellor, what would you do?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.960
And when I hear that,

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.400
what I

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.040
hear is people who are worried about what is happening

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.200
and they want me to fix this quickly.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.080
I want to make this clear to you,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.160
we're not going to fix this quickly.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.200
It's not that easy. It's not going to be easy.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.880
The richest

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.120
and most powerful people

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.880
in my country, in your country, wherever you are,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.880
are going to try and stop this, okay?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.120
They are getting richer from it.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.160
The politicians,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.760
the economists,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.360
they are getting richer year after year.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.840
They're going to attack me, they’re

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.320
going to attack the things that I'm saying.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.560
Even if I was to get into power,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.400
these guys would try and lobby

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.840
to put holes in the rules.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.520
They would try and get the newspapers

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.120
to say it was nonsense.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.360
They try and stop it. It's not going to be easy.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.240
It's not going to be easy.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.320
Look, your grandparents

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.080
and your great grandparents lived in poverty

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.720
and they fought for generations

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.800
and generations and generations.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.600
And that is the reason why

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.440
you don't have to live

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.680
in the kind of poverty that they lived in.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.920
Because they came back from the war

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.600
and they demanded food,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.840
housing, education, health care.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.160
And they got it, and they got it by taxing the rich.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.400
They understood that

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.080
the only way to protect working

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.960
people was to tax work less and wealth more.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.720
You need to fight that same fight.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.000
There's a quote by the old politician,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.600
British politician Tony Benn that I like,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.560
he said, there’s no final victory

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.640
and there's no final defeat.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.800
There's only the same fight to be fought again

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.600
and again and again.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.160
So toughen up.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.440
Listen,

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.200
I don't do this work because I think I'm going to win.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.800
And I don't do this work because I think it's easy.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.240
I do it because I know if we don't fight this fight,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.680
if you don't fight this fight,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.920
this economic situation gets worse

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.600
and worse and worse and worse.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.040
But we've done it before.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.920
Your grandparents,

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.320
your great grandparents did it before.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.600
They demanded that

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.680
instead of the rich getting richer and richer,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.400
every generation, wealth

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.240
flowed back to the working classes.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.800
And they recognised you do that by taxing the rich.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.040
Listen, the government in my country,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.680
the government in your country is going to fail.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.240
The only people who can protect

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.600
ordinary working people is you.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.880
You can do this.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.160
You have to do this.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.680
One last thing.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.560
If you're wondering

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.520
why there's a bouquet of flowers over my shoulder.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.360
That's from Penguin, the publishing corporation,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.600
for the book being number one.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.560
Thanks for your support.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.760
You can do this. We can do this. Good luck.
