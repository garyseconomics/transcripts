00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.360
Welcome back to Gary's Economics
today&nbsp;we're gonna explain "who pays tax?"

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.760
so I want to do a quick explanation basically of&nbsp;
exactly how the tax system works and who pays tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.640
um largely because there are a lot of sound bites&nbsp;
bouncing around that are intentionally misleading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.160
which are designed to make people think that
the tax system is already unfair&nbsp;to the rich&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.200
so the big one which you hear, which&nbsp;I get
thrown at me sometimes when I do interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.480
is that the richest 1% already pay 28% of tax&nbsp;
now this is very misleading so the first&nbsp;thing

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.720
is that is actually not the 'Richest' 1%&nbsp;of
people it is the top 1% of&nbsp;'Taxpayers'

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.920
now every year we get The Times Rich List&nbsp;
the rich people in the country and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.920
also get another list of the top taxpayers in the&nbsp;
country and I think it's really interesting to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.000
and compare these 2 lists, often what you'll&nbsp;find
is there's almost nobody who is on both of&nbsp;the lists

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.960
which I think is quite interesting and&nbsp;that is
because the people who pay the most tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.840
uh whilst they are generally rich people they are&nbsp;
NOT the richest people in the country and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040
going to explain in this video why 'people pay the&nbsp;
most tax are not the richest people in the country'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.800
the second reason that statistic is misleading&nbsp;
is because that is talking about only income tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.200
so it's saying the people who pay the top one the&nbsp;
top 1% income taxpayers are paying 28% of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.920
income tax um but actually income tax is only&nbsp;
one form of tax there are other forms of tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.760
which are tilted much more towards ordinary&nbsp;
people so for example the government raises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.480
more from VAT and from National Insurance than&nbsp;
it raised on Income Tax. VAT (Value-Added Tax) is

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.000
a tax which is on consumption; ordinary and poorer
people pay&nbsp;a much higher rate of VAT as a % of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.120
their incomes and that is because ordinary people&nbsp;
spend a much higher percentage of&nbsp;their income

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.800
and National Insurance is a tax&nbsp;which
specifically excludes income&nbsp;from wealth&nbsp;

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.800
which is the vast majority&nbsp;of the income
that richer people make um&nbsp;so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.160
basically these statistics are misleading&nbsp;
and the best way for you to understand it is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.040
me to explain exactly what is really happening&nbsp;
which is we have a tax system which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.000
'broadly progressive' meaning people who have higher&nbsp;
incomes pay higher tax at sort of ordinary income level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.400
so if you are earning £100,000 a year&nbsp;from your
work you'll pay a higher rate of income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.600
tax overall than somebody earning £15,000 or
£20,000 a year that stays true up until about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.200
£150,000-£200,000, then once you&nbsp;start
seeing people who are earning above

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.280
£200,000 what we actually see is that the&nbsp;
rates of tax paid start to fall significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.280
and the reason for this is that our current&nbsp;
tax system is very well designed for taxing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.480
working people so if you work for your money&nbsp;
which most people do or I work for the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.160
that I made especially if you're earning a high
income&nbsp;you will pay relatively high levels of tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.680
you know into the sort of 60%'s once we include&nbsp;
National Insurance and Income Tax and VAT&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.720
but the tax system as it is is not really&nbsp;designed
to tax people whose wealth comes&nbsp;from...&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.120
whose income comes from wealth um if&nbsp;
you don't understand the concept of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.760
from wealth I would recommend you watch&nbsp;
the video on the channel what as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.880
um that basically explains that there's a huge&nbsp;
amount of wealth in this country not just housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.520
but also a lot of commercial wealth: land, shopping&nbsp;
centres, office buildings, factories, wind farms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.320
industrial wealth and these are owned by richer&nbsp;
people and they generate enormous amounts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.000
income from this world so if we consider someone&nbsp;
like Rishi Sunak who is worth about according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.160
The Times Rich List £700 million, he will make&nbsp;
every year from his wealth probably something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.320
£30 million, remember that's not from his&nbsp;
work right that is the money that he just gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.280
for owning lots of stuff like your mortgage or&nbsp;
your house um the way the tax system is designed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.760
it is very possible for people such as Rishi Sunak
who generate huge amounts of income from wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.320
to legally avoid... well first of all they&nbsp;don't have to pay
income tax on a lot of that and they can legally avoid

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.760
many forms of&nbsp;taxes, so the end result is
in many cases these&nbsp;people pay rates as low

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.400
as 10% or sometimes&nbsp;even lower
on the income from their wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.280
so what we actually have is a tax system which is&nbsp;
progressive for ordinary people so the rate you pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.560
is higher the more you earn and then once you&nbsp;
get into this realm of very very wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.680
the rate starts to collapse and in particular&nbsp;
the rate on inherited wealth especially for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.480
phenomenally wealthy people falls to zero&nbsp;
so you end up in a situation where the tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.960
system is not really progressive it's basically&nbsp;
progressive for ordinary people and essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.840
optional for wealthy families um I think that's&nbsp;
probably the fairest way to describe the tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.160
system that we have which is essentially it's&nbsp;
a class-based tax system so I'm a relatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.960
wealthy person I'm worth you know more than a&nbsp;
couple of million pounds and I earnt that through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.080
working so when I worked I had to pay it was&nbsp;
actually a 50% top rate of income tax at the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.040
at the same time as I earned a few million pounds&nbsp;
from working the Duke of Westminster inherited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.360
£9,000,000,000 which is you know maybe three&nbsp;
thousand times what I earned and he paid nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.920
so I think that really highlights essentially&nbsp;
what we have is a class-based tax system I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.480
earned many many thousands of times&nbsp;
less than the Duke of Westminster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.880
but I come from a poor family so I have to&nbsp;
pay 50% tax the Duke of estimates that earn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.240
a thousand times more than me but he is the&nbsp;
Duke of Westminster so he pays 0% tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.520
and I think it's it's quite interesting that
in a way the tax system is kind of moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.880
back towards what it was like in medieval&nbsp;
times where essentially working people pay tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.120
to the aristocracy um because if you look&nbsp;
at for example someone like Rishi sunak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.480
the amount of tax that he pays is enormously&nbsp;
less than the amount of cash flows he receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.320
from working people and increasingly a big chunk&nbsp;
of the tax that you pay literally goes towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.080
paying government debt interest to the Rich, um
so you pay your tax - a lot of that goes to the Rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.080
then you pay your rent - that goes to the Rich&nbsp;
you pay your mortgage - that goes to Rich&nbsp;

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.960
you go to buy food and that goes to the landowners
you&nbsp;buy energy and that goes to the energy owners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.760
um so essentially what you have essentially looks&nbsp;
increasing like a very very extractive system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.080
and the lack of taxation of the rich creates&nbsp;
a big problem with flows of wealth so recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:15.480
I've been really trying to lobby politicians, very&nbsp;
unsuccessfully, to start taxing wealth, tax working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.680
people less on their income and tax wealth more&nbsp;
and you know I've been trying to push them to tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.240
people who have a wealth of over £10 million; 1%
of their wealth um and they don't&nbsp;want to do that&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.160
but wealthy people will make three,&nbsp;four, five
percent income on their wealth anyway so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.120
what that means is even if you were to tax&nbsp;
them one percent they would still generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.240
enormous excess income that they could then use to&nbsp;
compete with your kids to buy property and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.640
when you think about the tax system I think&nbsp;
another story that illustrates it quite well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.760
is you know I've got friends um you know&nbsp;
I think of one friend who's you know very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.600
well educated and he earns probably about three&nbsp;
times average income now and he lives with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.920
mum to try and save up money to buy a house and&nbsp;
because he's earning higher than average income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.040
he probably pays you know above 50% if&nbsp;you
include National Insurance on his on his income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.920
um and when he goes to buy properties those&nbsp;
properties end up getting bought by people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.400
got given half a million pound tax-free from&nbsp;
their mum, um I think this kind of highlights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.200
what's happening you know my friend is paying&nbsp;
50% because he's from a poor family and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.680
person who buys that house is paying 0% on&nbsp;their
income because they're from a better off family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.600
and The Duke of Westminster inherits £9 billion&nbsp;
and pays nothing because he's from a very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:48.000
rich family um so yeah the tax system&nbsp;as it is, I
should probably just talk briefly about&nbsp;VAT &amp; N.I.&nbsp;

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.400
National Insurance&nbsp;is a form of income tax
that only applies to&nbsp;working people

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.360
only applies to work, so you know&nbsp;my income,
I pay income tax on some of my income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.600
but I don't have to pay any National Insurance&nbsp;because
I don't work (well I do work but I don't make&nbsp;any money)&nbsp;

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.640
from this work um so we have a form&nbsp;of tax
National Insurance specifically targeted&nbsp;at

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:15.400
working people then you have VAT which is on&nbsp;
consumption now very rich people consume very&nbsp;

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.800
very small percentage of their income so they pay
very little VAT, so VAT targeted at ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.720
National Insurance targeted at working people&nbsp;
Income Tax avoidable for the rich, Inheritance Tax &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.240
avoidable for the rich, the end result is you have&nbsp;
a tax system which looks progressive for ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.320
people because you're only comparing yourself to&nbsp;
people around you who are ordinary people at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.320
same time you have this small group of people&nbsp;
who are phenomenally Rich who are increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.200
buying everything you don't often get to see&nbsp;
in day-to-day life that they are paying nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.680
generating huge amounts of income and using&nbsp;
that income to buy the rest of the assets so&nbsp;um&nbsp;

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.280
who pays tax uh if you're a working person in&nbsp;
an ordinary financial situation uh, YOU! &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.000
who doesn't pay tax? very wealthy families, the
people who&nbsp;receive your mortgage payments

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.440
your rent payments, um the money you spend
on food and&nbsp;bills, they don't pay any tax on that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.800
and they are then using that money to buy the&nbsp;
rest of the wealth so it creates this really bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.360
structural problem where because we're not taxing&nbsp;
the rich, because they have these huge incomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.800
they are then buying all of the rest of the&nbsp;
assets so they kind of end up being like a

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.440
black hole for assets sucking all of the&nbsp;assets
out of society and if we don't take any&nbsp;action

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.760
against that it is inevitable that in you&nbsp;know
20 years, 30 years, ordinary families will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.560
not have any assets left basically. it will&nbsp;be very
difficult to own property and if you do&nbsp;own property&nbsp;

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.800
you'll be forced to have an enormous&nbsp;mortgage
um so yeah tax is paid by working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.560
it's not paid by the rich, if we don't do something&nbsp;
about that inequality will grow massively we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.880
lose our middle class who will lose their assets&nbsp;
um I'd really encourage you you know if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.760
an older person who owns property to think about&nbsp;
what that means to your kids and your grandkids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.720
um if you're a younger person this is probably&nbsp;
no news to you but um try and think about ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.320
to communicate clearly to older generations you&nbsp;
know what this means for the future of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.120
if we don't fix the tax system then the&nbsp;
majority of the people in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.080
would end up being very poor but if we do&nbsp;
fix the tax system we can change it so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.880
yeah understand what's happening share this video&nbsp;
and um yeah help us to change it thank you! happy?
