00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.150
This video is about Coronavirus and
money. Now this is a really important

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.050
video, I've been wanting to make it for a long time, because huge, huge, historic things

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.380
are happening in the world of money here. Even when I was working as a money trader in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.600
the 2008 crisis nothing ever happened of
this speed.  Now what's happening in the world

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.630
of money here is going to dominate the
economy for the next few years

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
quite possibly even the next few decades.
It's going to affect you it's going to affect

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.250
your family's financial position, so if
you want to understand what's going to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.000
happen in the economy going forward, you've got to watch this video.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.500
Now so far in this crisis, most workers have had their incomes relatively protected. in this country the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.400
In this country, the UK, most workers are still working and getting their regular incomes,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.980
of those who can't work the majority are
being supported by government furlough

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.280
and self-employment schemes.
Now, as many as five and a half million

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920
workers are falling through the gaps of
those schemes and are getting almost no

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
income support.  Now those guys already
are feeling the pain of this financial crisis,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.820
but what we're going to explain in
this video is how even if your income is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
being supported, the changes in the
world of money, behind the scenes, are

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
going to affect your financial position
going forward.  Now we're going to explain how.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.350
Now the biggest changes have been happening in the world of government and central banks,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.600
now this is happening all over the
world, but in the UK the central bank, the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
Bank of England, has committed to
printing 300 billion pounds,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.650
300 billion pounds, it's an enormous amount of money,
it's £4,500 for

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
every single man, woman and child in the
country.  It's more than three times the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
net worth of Jeff Bezos, the world's
richest man.  Now when such a huge amount

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.770
of money gets printed and put into the
economy, it's really important you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.360
understand three things about it:

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.500
1. How does it work? So we are going to talk about exactly what money printing is.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
2. Where does the money go?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.000
3. Where does the money end up.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.160
Now those last two things they may sound similar

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.100
but they're actually crucially different, and we're going to explain why.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.380
Okay so number one, how does this new money work.  So I think a lot of people are confused by the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.950
concept of money printing.  It's important
to understand that this 300 billion

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.800
pound is brand-new money created by the
central bank.  Now if that's confusing to you,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.869
you just need to understand that the
central bank has the legal right to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.020
print or create brand-new money.  Now we
say "print money" to give the visual idea

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.380
of a printing press printing out new
banknotes, but in reality nowadays

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.070
most money is electronic, so what
that means in practice is that the Bank

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.900
of England is allowed to simply credit
its own account with new money.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.920
Okay, so this is brand new money, it doesn't come from anyone, it's not raised through taxes

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
it's simply created by the Bank of
England.  When that money gets poured into

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.290
the system we need to understand who's
gonna get it, and the next question: where

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.370
does it go?  Now most of this money is
getting lent from the Bank of England

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.540
to the government.  Now even though this
is brand-newly created money, and the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.930
Bank of England is a government
institution, the government still has to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.590
borrow it from the Bank of England.  This
creates a debt which legally the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.340
government has to pay back.  For this
reason government debt has increased

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870
hugely already in this crisis and just
recently UK government debt has gone

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.120
above 100% of GDP for the first time in
over 50 years.  So what does the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.420
government then do with this money.  Well
the government gives most of it to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.500
furloughed workers and other workers who
can't get their income during the Coronavirus crisis

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.350
This brings us to part three:
where does the money end up?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.430
now we know the money is being paid to furloughed workers.  But if we look at

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.940
the actual situation of furloughed
workers, they're actually receiving less

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.050
income than they were before the crisis
happened.  This is because, even though

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.910
they're receiving government income
support

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.380
it's only 80 percent of their original
wages and their original wages are no

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.880
longer coming in.  So this creates a
mystery.  We know that a lot of new money

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.600
is coming into the economy, and we know
that ultimately it's going to the furloughed

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.200
workers, but the furloughed workers
are no richer than they were before.  So

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.250
where's the money going?
that brings us to question number three

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.360
Where does the money end up?  Now we know the money is being paid to the furloughed

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.110
workers.  But the furloughed workers
have less money than they had before the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.410
Coronavirus crisis, because they've
lost the wages that they were originally

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.850
being paid.  If we want to know who ends
up with the money we need to find out

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.209
who has those wages?  Where have the wages gone that used to be paid to the workers?

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.630
So if you want to understand we have to
follow this cash flow back through the system

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.150
Now, normally wages get paid to the
workers through the companies.  But if we look

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.209
at the companies, we will find that most of
these companies are struggling as well

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.630
because customers have simply stopped
coming to their stores and stopped

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.120
buying this stuff.  So we need to follow
the cash flow back

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.770
one step further, to the customers.  Now
the customers in this crisis have

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.389
dropped their spending massively.  For
that reason, many of these customers are

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.900
holding more money in their pockets.  That
money is not going to the companies

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.130
which means the wages have stopped.  So
the people who are holding more money,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.560
the net benefitors of the new money being
put into the system are actually the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.169
customers.  Now when I say that, you're
probably thinking "wait a minute I'm a

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.000
customer where's my £4,500 per man
woman and child?" and that would be a good question.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.490
The reason why you might not be
holding £4,500 more than you were

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.830
before is because not all customers are
created equal.  Remember the reason that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.280
customers have more money now than they had before the crisis is because they've

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.500
cut their spending.  But it's not all
spending that has cut here.  Spending on

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.630
essentials such as rent, mortgage, food
and bills still has to be paid.  So if

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.510
most of your spending is on those
essentials, you're spending won't have

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.389
fallen by much.  The spending that has
fallen is on non essentials and luxuries.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.870
So see here, the customers who are saving
the most money are the ones who have

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.940
very high spending on non essentials and
luxuries.  Well, you're probably starting

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.900
to see where I'm going with this.  Who
spends a lot of money on luxuries?

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.800
The customers who are accumulating money
during this crisis are the rich.

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.500
Now I wrote an article predicting this back in March, explaining how rich people, because

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.740
they would cut their spending would
accumulate savings and money during this

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.840
crisis.  Since then, data has come out from
a lot of institutions, including the IPPR

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.370
in the UK, demonstrating clearly that
rich people have been accumulating money

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.060
during this crisis, because their
spending has reduced so much.  It's

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.150
interesting to compare here the
situation of a furloughed worker with a

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.229
richer person in the economy.  Furloughed
workers have lost their income, which

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.490
comes from services jobs, but they've
kept most of their spending, which is

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.930
largely on essentials like rent and
bills.  Richer workers, who tend to work in

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.050
office jobs and can work from home, have
kept their incomes, whereas their

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.430
spending, which is largely on luxuries, has
collapsed.  It's important to understand

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.250
the significance it has on the economy
when the rich people stop spending.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.009
Now in normal times, rich people have
very

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.089
high spending, much higher than ordinary
workers.  Because that spending goes to

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.919
companies, which employ workers, it
contributes to wages being paid.  This is

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:55.529
really important because ordinary
workers have to pay bills, rent, food.  When

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.439
they pay that money, a lot of that money
ends up going to the owners of the

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.939
houses and owners of the corporations
who are themselves the rich.  So as you

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.569
can see in this diagram, in a normal
situation, the spending of the rich goes

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.289
to the workers, and when the workers pay
the rent, bills and food, it goes back to

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:14.189
the rich.  The money flows around in a
circle.  So what happens when the rich

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:18.360
suddenly stop spending?  Well that money
was driving the wages for ordinary

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.460
workers.  Suddenly, the workers' wages have disappeared.  But they still have to pay

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.159
the rent, they still have to pay the
mortgage, they still have to pay the

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.479
bills.  How are they gonna do that with no
income?  It's a massive problem and if

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.270
nothing happens some of these guys they
could become homeless

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.229
they could even not even get food on the
table.  So it's no surprise that in this

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.069
emergency situation the government and
the Bank of England stepped in with the

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.449
furlough scheme.  This provides a substitute income to ordinary workers who have lost

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.709
their wages.  It's important to realise
that at this point, from the perspective

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:54.300
of the worker things actually look quite
similar to how they did pre-crisis.  They've got an

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.959
income, they've got their expenditure.  The
income's a little bit less, they have to

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:02.159
save a little bit, but from their
perspective the situation is largely

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:06.899
unchanged.  But look at what is happening
outside in the system.  Previously the

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:11.099
money was going out in a circle.  What's
happening now?  The money gets printed by

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:15.209
the Bank of England, it goes to the
worker, the worker pays their bills,

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:20.789
it goes to the rich, and then... it just
stays there!  Because the rich are not

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:24.419
spending their money anymore.  That means money piles up with the rich and

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:30.209
accumulates, and what happens with the
government?  They accumulate debt.  Okay so

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:34.500
we've learned that during the Covid
crisis, most people's financial situation

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.479
appears relatively unchanged.  However,
behind the scenes the government is

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.760
accumulating big piles of debt, and the
rich are accumulating big piles of money.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.639
The next question is... why does that
matter?  Well the easier part of that

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:54.050
question is to talk about why big
government debt could affect you.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.740
Those of you who are old enough to
remember 2008 will remember at that time

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.910
too, government debt increased, and the
government came in and used that to

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.529
enforce austerity.  Now that impacted a
lot of people, it had a lot of effects

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:11.450
in many, many different ways.  That could
happen again if government debt increases

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.250
again.  Now I'm not a politician,
I'm not political forecaster I'm an

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.360
economic forecaster.  I can't tell you if
austerity will happen again.  But what I

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.560
want to talk about is those big piles of
money stacking up in rich people's bank

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.100
accounts.  How's that gonna affect you?  So what does it mean if the rich get richer?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.290
I mean if they just stack the money in
their bank account it's probably not a

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.180
problem right?  Personally, I worked in the
finance industry for a long time, I

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.720
managed money for the rich, I've got
involved in understanding how they

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.540
invest their money.  Through that I made
some money myself

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.470
I got involved in investing myself.  I
know a little bit about what the rich do

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.560
when money starts piling up in their
bank account.  Number one, they buy houses

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.920
but it's not just houses they buy, they
buy stocks, they buy shares, they buy

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.170
bonds, they buy gold.  To be honest, they
buy everything.  Now let's look at what

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.370
happened last time the government used
money printing to solve a financial

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:15.079
crisis.  We can look back to the 2008
crisis.  In many ways, that was similar.

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:19.070
That time, too, the Bank of England printed a huge amount of money to try and deal with an

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:24.380
economic crisis.  What happened then? 
Well within six years stock prices in London

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.750
had doubled.  Within three years the gold
price was up 150%, and within 10 years of

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:35.959
the crisis, London house prices had
doubled.  What does that mean?  Well in the

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:42.199
20 years since 2000, through that period
of crisis and rising house prices, the

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:44.779
percentage of young people who've been
able to afford a home in this country

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:52.370
has fallen from 65% to 27%.  What will it
mean if house prices double again?  It'll

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.899
mean that, realistically, people who are
from a family that doesn't have a home

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:02.029
now, will probably never own housing.  It means that those people will be locked out of

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:07.250
the housing market forever.  It means that
young people will find it more difficult to

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.020
get the security of a home to raise a family.
And at the same

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.950
time as that's happening, stock prices
are gonna go up, gold price is gonna go

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:21.440
up, the rich are gonna get richer than
ever before.  But it's not just stocks and

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.890
shares and housing that these guys are
going to buy.  They'll be in the shops too

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:29.270
and they'll have a lot more money to push
those prices up.  It's very likely that

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.600
over the next few years we're going to
see the prices of a lot of things

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.820
increase.  At the same time, what's going
to happen to wages?  Well we've already

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.540
seen the unemployment rate double in this
country, and that's in spite of a

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.680
furlough scheme encouraging firms to
keep jobs on.  There's currently nine

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.910
million workers on that furlough scheme,
and when that starts to be wrapped up a lot

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.120
of those workers will probably be pushed
into unemployment.  With unemployment

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.280
going up and up and up,
it's very likely that just as house prices and prices in

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.910
the shops are rising, wages will stay low.
Okay so what can we do?  We know that

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.240
under the current situation the rich are
going to get richer, while wages full

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.230
house prices rise and shop prices
increase.  It's going to make housing

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.600
unaffordable and it's going to drop the
living conditions for regular people.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.150
Can it be fixed?  Well, personally I think that
it can.  If you go back and look at this

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.930
slide explaining the problem, we can see
what's happening.  Money, currently, is

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.070
flowing from the government to the rich,
leaving the government with big piles of

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.630
debt and the rich with big piles of
money.  We can actually fix this with one

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.820
simple arrow in this diagram.  If we start
money moving, back round the system, away

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.200
from the rich, no more cash piles for the
rich, no more debt for the government.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.790
In my opinion we need to find a ways the
tax of truly rich in our society, by

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.110
taxing wealth rather than just income.
This will draw money from the wealthiest

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.430
people in our society, the people who get
their income from owning assets, rather

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:00.050
than working.  Ultimately we need to find
a way to make the richest in our society

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:05.080
contribute to fixing this crisis rather
than simply profiting from it.  Otherwise

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.760
financial security is going to move out
of the reach of our kids.  Thank you for
