00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm back.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.960
Okay, so I'm back.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.840
Thanks for waiting. Merry Christmas.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.240
Today we're going to explain

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.160
where I've been for the last six months,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
what I've been doing and what we're going to do next.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.480
Okay, so what I've been doing in the last

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.760
six months is mainly

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.280
writing this book, The Trading Game. Gary Stevenson.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.160
This is going to be published 5th of March

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.600
by Penguin here in the UK,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.960
in the US, and a ton of other countries as well.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.160
This is my baby.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.560
This is where I've been.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.960
So I haven’t spoken

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
that much about a book on this channel, but basically

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.440
two and a half years ago

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.760
I got a call from a literary agent,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.520
that's a book agent,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.720
asking me if I wanted to write a book and

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.800
basically told him to get lost

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.280
because I wasn't really thinking

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.400
about writing a book at that time.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.160
I was very focused on doing the YouTube.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.080
But it kind of got me thinking that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.560
a book might be a good way to basically use

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.600
my back story to really kick the doors down

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.160
and get a much bigger

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.120
audience for the stuff that we're doing here.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.600
So I've been kind of holding my personal story back a little bit.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.280
I haven't used it too much on the channel,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.520
especially my mainstream media,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.000
because I've always thought that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.720
if we find the right vehicle for it,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.760
we could really,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.120
perhaps get a lot of publicity

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.400
and also really convince

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.840
of people about the importance of the message

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.520
that we're doing here.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.520
So for those who don't know

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.560
my back story,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.760
I grew up not too far from here

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.520
in East London, from a very poor background.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.400
I was expelled from school when I was a teenager,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.920
but when I was, I think, 20,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.600
I won a competition, a card game,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.240
and that got me a job in one of these skyscrapers

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.960
over here working as a trader.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.840
You know, at that time,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.200
I was not a very political person.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.440
When I was a kid, I was very focused on making money.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.400
But within a couple of years of working as a trader,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
I became convinced that the global economy

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840
would get worse and worse for ordinary people.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.360
I started betting on that very aggressively,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
and those bets made me millions of pounds.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.000
And ultimately I became a millionaire

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.160
by betting on the collapse of the economy.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.240
And that is what politicised me.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.800
So after getting this call about writing a book, it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.240
kind of made me think, maybe I can use this story.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.960
If I can tell this story, if I can really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.520
bring people into experience,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.680
what I experienced, then, you know,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.720
maybe we could have a massive story

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.160
and maybe we could convince other people

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.480
of what I became convinced of,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.080
which is that we need to make change.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.680
So I started writing the book and I was doing that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.360
on the side of the YouTube for a long time.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.000
It's not easy

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.200
writing a book, and,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.440
you know,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.480
I don't have a history of writing,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.440
so I kind of gave up after six months,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.720
but I had little bits and bobs put aside.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.960
I got another call early last year from an editor at a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.080
publishing house saying, you know

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.200
“have you thought of writing a book?”

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.120
and she convinced me to send her

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880
some of the work that I’d done,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.080
they offered me a deal and that was

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.000
what made me sort of think,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.160
maybe we can really do this, basically.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.560
So I called back

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.280
the agent who called me the previous year

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.320
and I said “Listen, I’ve got offered a deal.”

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.480
I also went back and read the stuff that I'd written,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.280
and I realised, like, that's actually like

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.080
it's quite a cool voice. It's very it's very real.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.840
It's really explaining how this place really is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.720
in a way that I think

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.840
will be relatable in the way that to me

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.920
at least a lot of books aren’t.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.640
And it convinced me that I could do it.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.880
So I wrote 20,000 words. I sent it to this agent.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.600
He sent it off.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.960
And within a day we had like two massive deals

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.040
from two of the biggest publishers in the country.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.120
I turned him down

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880
because I said I needed to really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.680
look these guys in the face.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.400
And then we got a ton of offers from everybody.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560
And that's when I realised that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.320
we could have a really big opportunity

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.800
to really write a book that's really big and really,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.440
really blows this story open basically,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.280
and brings a lot of attention to what we're doing here

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.960
and maybe we can get a movie.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.720
We've already had movie offers for the book,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.680
which is a bit crazy

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.680
and we’re in discussion for that now.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.960
So basically this is what I had in my mind

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.560
earlier this year

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.800
when I was making the videos, which is...

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.560
first of all, I was really loving writing the book.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560
And as I was writing, I was kind of realising like,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.000
this has every chance to be to be massive.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.320
The channel was growing as well,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.520
and I was kind of thinking,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.280
when this book comes out next year in March,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.000
are we going to be ready

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.040
for the amount of publicity

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.000
that we're going to receive. And,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.240
you know,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.000
I haven't spoken that much

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.600
about how this channel is set up.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.840
But up until now it's just been me

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.800
and my mate from high school, you know, doing it.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.320
No funding, you know, not that much equipment.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.120
Just, you know, no support, basically.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.040
No, no staff, no team.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.840
And I didn't think

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.160
and I don't think that that is going to be enough

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.760
to support us for the hopefully,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.960
the big boost in publicity

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.240
we're going to get in February,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.280
March, when the book comes out.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.400
So I decided to take a bit of time out,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
finish editing the book off,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.880
and also like

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.320
try and get a team together

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.760
so that we're able to maximise

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.720
the publicity we're going to get.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.360
Because we're going to get

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.560
a ton of publicity around the book.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.800
But I don't want it to be just about the book.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.960
I think the book is really good,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.640
but I also want to take the publicity

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.040
and use it to help us really grow this

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.280
channel as a political movement.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.840
Because I think if we don't do that, we're going to see

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.760
big problems. So

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.200
I took some time out

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.560
to try

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.000
and sort out some funding, try and sort out

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.160
some professional structures,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.760
try and sort out a team to work behind the YouTube

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.000
so that when this book comes out,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.400
we can hopefully use it to really blow

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
this thing up and start having some real influence.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.560
But that's done now.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.080
The team is ready. Hopefully I'm ready.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.080
The book is banging,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.560
so I've been speaking to Waterstones

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.240
about getting you a discount code

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.960
and I'm pretty sure they're going to give me one.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.120
A discount code for watchers of the channel.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.560
If we've got that, it'll be in the description.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.720
I'm pretty sure there will be one down there.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.320
You can use that to preorder the book.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920
It's coming out on March 5th.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.200
You know,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.240
I don't want to be big like

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.160
sell the book, sell the book,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.400
but if we get a load of preorders,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.920
then we can come in like,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.240
you know, try and come in high out

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.000
number one in the bestsellers list.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.200
And that's going to help give us a big boost.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.160
But more than that,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.760
you know, the book is banging and I'm very proud of it.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.640
I really enjoy it. I hope you're going to like it.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.320
But, you know, listen,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320
for me, the book is part of the project.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.080
It's going to give us a massive opportunity to grow.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.160
I'm super excited about it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.600
I hope you're excited by it as well.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.320
And I'm back now.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.560
We're going to be making videos again.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.280
We're going to try and grow

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.360
this and we're going to try and

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.320
stop this disaster from getting any worse.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.360
So thank you for waiting.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.760
Thanks for your support. Once again, this is the book.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.040
Get behind it.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.280
But we're back with videos as well

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.240
every week from now on.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.760
So thanks for waiting and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.160
let's move forward and make this a big thing.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.520
Thank you.
