00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
So we get a lot of comments

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.040
saying, oh yeah, it's all well

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.480
and good, you identified the problem,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.200
but how do we fix it? How do we fix it?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.680
Understandable frustration

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.320
because things are bad, things are getting worse,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600
and I make that very clear.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.120
But I guess people would suggest, like,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.440
how does that help? Unless you have a solution.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.560
So I wanted to do a video where we basically, sort of,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.720
talk about that and talk about what the solution is.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.520
whenever I hear people say, what are the solutions,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.360
I always hear

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.280
in my head two separate questions.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.000
So, I mean, the first thing is,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.840
if you want a solution,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080
you do need to understand the problem.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.560
And I have a very, very clear understanding of,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.600
in my opinion, what the problem is,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.760
which is that we have a growing wealth inequality.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.640
If you want to make things better,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880
you have to bring that wealth inequality down.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.200
If you want to stop things getting worse,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.720
you at least have to stop it from increasing.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.680
It's increasing at the moment very quickly.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.760
This is what we talk about all the time,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
it's up to people whether they agree with me on that.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.760
Once you accept that, then how do you fix it?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.600
And I always hear two questions there,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.960
which is, number one,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.280
technically, how do you reduce wealth inequality

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.200
or at least how do you stop it from increasing?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.080
And number two,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.840
how do you build the popular support for it?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.480
I think these are basically,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.240
these are the two battles which you have to win.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.640
You have to win both.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
There's no point winning one without the other.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.560
You know, if you work out the taxes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560
but people don't support, you won't get the tax.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.280
If you get people to support it but you then, you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.120
then apply the tax badly, you’ll f*ck things up.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.320
So you need to win both of those battles.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.560
And I think

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.200
the first thing which I want people to understand is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.400
we are not going to win this soon.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
This is like number one thing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.920
which you have to realise.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320
We are not going to...

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.520
at the moment wealth inequality

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.440
is increasing really quickly.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.680
Living standards are falling quite quickly.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.760
That will continue,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.200
you know, I'd be very surprised

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.280
if we got any improvement on that

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.440
in at least a couple of years.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.480
So, number one, like, sit with that for a bit

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.640
because that's something to deal with.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.960
Like, that is something that you need to recognise.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.920
Like, if you are hoping for better soon,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.560
you're not going to get better soon.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.320
And that is like a really depressing message to give.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.920
But it's better to know that now

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.800
than to sit around hoping for improvement

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.120
that doesn't come.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.960
So number one, except that, once you've accepted that,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.960
then the next thing that you should accept after that,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.840
is that if we want to,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.720
if we want improvement, we

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.080
have to win the long term battle

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.320
because we're not going to win the short term battle.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.200
We lost the short term battle.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.920
We have to win the long term battle.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.720
And that is why everything that I do

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.160
is focused on winning the long term battle.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.640
Which is,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.640
let me flip it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.200
to a more positive way of looking at it,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.000
which I think is true.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.600
The opportunity here

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.000
to win the kind of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.840
ideological theoretical debate

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.000
has never been bigger because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.040
the percentage of people

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.760
in this country

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.680
and throughout the West

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.800
are being really hurt by the economic changes

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.600
now is bigger than it has been

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680
for, since before the Second World

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.400
War, basically an enormous amount.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.720
The current system is not working

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.000
for an enormous number of people

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
and that percentage of people is increasing.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.840
Now, if you go back and you look at

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360
the 2010, 2015 austerity period of the 2010s, basically

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720
austerity decade in this country,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.480
the pain was really loaded on like the bottom 20%.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.280
And a lot of people will have felt a bit of pain.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.920
But the pain was really loaded on the poorest.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.440
And from the perspective of a democracy,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.600
it's difficult to stop that

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.880
because the poorest are a minority

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.640
and it's hard for them to defend themselves.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
Whereas now what you have is

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.200
50, 60, 70,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.160
you know, pushing up to 80% of people getting hit.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.960
That won't change.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.360
That's going to keep happening.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.560
So you have a massive opportunity here

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.640
to create this

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.920
broad political coalition of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.720
people that are getting hurt.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.200
So we have a massive opportunity

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.600
and not only that, it is definitely becoming

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600
increasingly clear

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.840
to an increasingly large number of people

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.160
that the status quo is not working.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800
And there's really demand for an alternative.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.720
And I don't think there are many

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.160
appealing alternatives being pushed.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.280
And the ones that are being pushed,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.880
I think are unlikely to work.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.160
So the gap which we can fill has never been bigger.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.240
There's a real big space

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.160
to bring a lot of people together to change the system,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.400
which is increasingly

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.680
clearly not working for a large number of people.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.920
But we're a long way from reaching them.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.240
So

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.520
I think, I’m me, I’m one person.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.920
And I think the biggest thing that I can do is to

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.240
grow this voice as

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.960
possible and I think, as big as possible.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.120
But I think it needs to be really

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160
clearly focused on

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.200
building this really clear narrative

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.720
that the reason things are getting worse

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.120
is because wealth inequality is getting worse.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.120
And the only way to make things better

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.680
is to make wealth inequality better.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680
And the strength

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.800
that we will always have with that argument

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.760
is that it's correct,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.640
which means that time will continually prove it

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.920
correct in the sense that,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.240
you know,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.720
Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are going to go on TV.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.520
They're going to get voted out.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.560
But, you know, Labour will come in

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.880
and they will say,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.960
we're going to do the things,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.040
I'm going to fix the economy,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.160
we're going to make the economy better,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.680
but they won't fix wealth inequality.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.720
And I'll come out in this channel and I will say,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.120
well, Labour will make all these promises,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.240
but they're not going to make the economy better

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.600
because they're not victims of inequality.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.480
And I will be right

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
and I will make a lot of clear predictions

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.480
about how that will manifest.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.280
Rising house prices, decreased home

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.760
ownership, increased levels of debt,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.040
decrease living conditions,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.400
And I will be the one who is right.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.760
My predictions will be right

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.120
and this will keep happening.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.200
So I think the power that we have behind this voice

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.360
is that it's correct,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.880
whereas the mainstream politicians will continually

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.120
sell tales of improvement, which won't happen.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.040
We will be out saying, no, things will get worse.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.720
You know,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.480
you can go back and look at our videos from June 2020.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.920
You know what I'm predicting

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.800
there's going to be an inflation

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.000
crisis, there’s going to be a cost of living

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.160
crisis, there's going to be like a massive

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.920
collapse in living standards in this country.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.040
And that's all proved right.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.800
You know, the longer we keep making this channel,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.320
the longer we have this long

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.560
track record of

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.280
of being correct when everyone else is being wrong.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.720
And I think that gives us this really

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.560
powerful opportunity to build a big message.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.760
And I think there will be people out there

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.960
that would say, you know, well,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.840
we don't

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.000
you know, we don't want to support your channel, Gary,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.120
we don't want this to be like, you know,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.480
you're not going to just be some saviour

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.200
that saves the world.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.680
And I 100% agree with that message

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.720
because I don't want it to be just me, you know.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.400
And it won't and we won't win if it's just me.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.640
Like what I see myself as doing is

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.800
helping people to understand what's happening.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800
And then you go take the understanding

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.960
and you build your message.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.360
This is the way like,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.040
of course I'm trying to grow my message,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.840
but we don't win by making this YouTube

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.960
channel have a million subs,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.880
you know what I mean, it's no good.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.720
We're not going to win.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.280
It would be great if we had millions subs,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.160
and I think we will get there one day, but

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.960
we won't win.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.200
We will win

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.120
if my YouTube channel has a million subs

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.400
and f*cking his does, and his does, and his does,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.320
and you know, not just on YouTube, you’re

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.840
spreading your message in whatever way you can,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.280
you know what I mean, and that's like,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.520
you know

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.480
if you can build a big voice for yourself great

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.400
but you don't need to

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.000
you know

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.800
if enough people spread this message

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.680
within their communities, that would be enough.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000
You know, their friends, their family,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.920
the people they go to football with, their workmates.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.360
You know, this...

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.120
I don't see this is as about being me...

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.520
I don't want this to be about me.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.880
I want this to be about one clear, true idea,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.520
which is you cannot make this better

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.840
unless you deal with this problem,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.760
this problem of wealth inequality.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.120
And, you know, I look at the way that,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.920
you know, Nigel Farage

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.320
created a country where, you know, 60% of people

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.000
demanded Brexit and he f*cking got his Brexit.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.800
You know,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.960
for better or worse he got it, you know,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.200
and you know that

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.160
as everybody is seeing

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.320
and I think people continue to see did not

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.120
and will not fix our economic problems,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.680
we need to make this happen for wealth inequality.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.520
We need to create a country where it becomes

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.600
common knowledge, just general common sense.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
If you don't fix wealth inequality,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.400
don't fix the problem.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.280
And then then people like me

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.160
and hopefully other people who will adopt the message.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.000
We can hold the politicians feet to the fire

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.880
and we can say, no, you know,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.880
the people demand this thing

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.600
and they will not vote for you

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.200
unless you give them this thing in the same way

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.040
that Nigel Farage did. So,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.240
you know,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.160
this is not a message

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.440
that rich people want you to hear.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.080
So, you know,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.280
we will always get kickback from

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.240
billionaire funded think tanks, billionaire owned

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.040
newspapers, billionaire owned radio stations.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.440
And that will always be what we fight against.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.360
But what we have, what they don't is that

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.480
this is correct and the predictions will be right.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.920
And I'll keep making right predictions

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.600
even if they're horrible predictions.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.920
And, you know, that's the way I see it.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.560
And, you know,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.480
I focus on that because that's what I can do.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.320
But I think people watching

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.840
who are demanding solutions,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.800
I think they have a choice to make, you know, which is,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.080
number one, do you support

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.360
people like me who would do what we're doing?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.600
And number two, do you create your own things?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.440
You know, do you spread the message in your own space?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.640
You know,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.160
whether that means, you know,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.240
creating your own forms of communication

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.600
or whether that means spreading amongst your community.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.040
And

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.360
the last thing I want to

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.240
add on this topic of solutions

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.200
is that I think if you've accepted

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.240
that it's a long term battle,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.520
then I think the other thing

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.840
which is really important is like the...

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.960
as much as possible,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.440
how do we maintain our mental health

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.840
and our mental health as communities basically?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.840
Because we're going to head into some really,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.360
really, really difficult times

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.320
and there's going to be a lot of

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320
like super divisive narratives going around about

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320
and increasingly

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.560
young people are going to be forced

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.960
to live lives of poverty.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.120
And that is going to be hard.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.600
And I see the damage

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.640
it does to the mental health of young people who

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.600
are being driven into poverty,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.960
really through no fault of their own,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.520
through a collapsing economy.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.320
And what I want young people to understand is that

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.840
the economy is changing in such a way

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.440
that poverty is being forced on more and more people.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.400
So I know this is not...

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.960
this is easier said than done,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.000
but I think that we

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.040
all have to be gentle with ourselves and one another.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.280
And the way that we judge one

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.000
another's financial positions,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.080
because we've been kind of trained with this idea

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.600
that if you're rich

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.280
it’s because you're great

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.960
and if you're poor, it's

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.200
because you're f*cking dumb or something, you know,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.280
and when you give people that message

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.880
in a world that gives people no chance

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.120
but to be poor, it's

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.840
unbelievably damaging to people’s self-esteem.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.520
And, you know, we're not going to win this fight

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.720
with a bunch of people

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.120
who have been trained to believe that

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.800
they're useless and that their failures,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.520
they're pathetic, you know?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.400
So we need to realise

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.600
there's a systemic problem

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.040
that is that is f*cking our young people.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.560
And that means that they will be poor

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.080
and it's not their fault.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.760
So, you know,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.920
if you're out there and you’re struggle

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920
and you're seeing other people

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.760
who are doing better than you,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.280
the truth is probably because of the family

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.880
they're from, the family assets that they hold.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.720
Don't beat yourself up on this.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.920
But at the same time, people

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.840
need to understand that it's going to be hard

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.760
and you're going to have to work hard

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.960
in many cases to support yourself,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.520
to support your family.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.120
But just like

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.320
I spoke before about

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.800
we only win this if we win the technical battle

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.000
and the ideological battle,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.680
individual people will only be able

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.960
to secure their futures

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.760
if they win their personal battles

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.800
as well as the political battle.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.520
Because

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.400
it doesn't matter how

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.440
well I do out here with the politicians, you know,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.880
you need to feed your kids.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.920
So if that means you work hard

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.080
and you don’t have time to support

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.800
anything we do politically, then that’s you.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.440
I would never judge anyone in that position.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.240
But if you work hard

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.840
and do everything you can

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.560
to support your kids

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.600
but the economy collapses, which it will,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760
then you know it's going to hit your family as well,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.880
you know.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.400
You know,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.320
sometimes your boat can sink in two ways

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.280
and you need to plug a few holes and

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.680
I think that...

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.720
We will win as a country and as a society

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.200
if enough of us are able to

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.720
fight both our personal battles

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.280
and our collective political battle at the same time.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.760
And I'm well aware that that's much easier for me

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.200
who does not have the financial difficulties

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.440
that people, other people have.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.000
And for that reason, I will try my best

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to take more than my share of the load.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.800
But it will be about whether enough of us can, can

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.640
come in and support it.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.960
And, you know, hopefully we'll see this thing grow

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.880
and then I'll start to get,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.960
I'll start to get some the politicians

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.240
and we can start having more discussions

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.080
about the technicalities

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.800
of what kind of taxes you bring in.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.640
But now is not the time for that

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.400
because we're losing the ideological battle.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.880
And, you know, and,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.440
you know, bad things can happen if we don't win that.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.800
So I'm going to focus on that.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.120
I would like to thank everybody for their support.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.840
You know, I'm sorry to be always coming in

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.960
with negative messages,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.040
but I think it's better to know

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.320
the truth of what's coming than...

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.160
than to be living in a bubble of false hope.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.360
You know, this is what we need to do.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.080
It's going to be hard.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.600
But, you know, tough times create strong people.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.240
And, you know, if we get enough strong people,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.120
then I think we can win.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.560
So, yeah, thanks, everyone, for

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.960
thank you, everybody for your support

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.760
and keep supporting the channel. Thank you.
