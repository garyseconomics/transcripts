00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.960
Today,
we are going to do a channel update.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.600
Okay, so

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.520
we're filming this beginning of April,
and the last month

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.080
has been absolutely mental for me
for the channel.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.520
I feel like I've done just about
every single podcast in the world.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.200
I’ve been in
just about every newspaper in the country.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.000
The channel has grown
unbelievably quickly,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.920
like every single channel YouTube,
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.160
And it's mainly
because of the book publicity.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.800
And the first thing to say is that
the book was number one.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.160
Most of you probably have seen the post
I did on various channels.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.280
The book came out number one,
beginning of March,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.240
biggest number
one of the year, massive, nearly twice.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.960
Number two,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.480
we stayed number one for two weeks,
which is amazing.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.800
It's really hard to stay number one
because all of your preorders

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.880
count to your first week.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120
So when you're competing
with like other week one books,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
they have a massive advantage.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
So it was crazy that we stayed number one,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.880
we've been in the top
three for four weeks now,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
just been beaten by new releases,
basically.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.120
I don't know what to say to be honest.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.720
The book is a Sunday Times
number one best selling book.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.800
And that's something that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.680
I would be able to take to my grave
and tell my grandkids about

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.480
if I ever have any.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.640
And that is basically

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.480
thanks to you guys who bought the book,
basically, we got the preorder numbers

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.520
in like a couple of weeks before
and the preorders were massive

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.360
and like, that would have been enough
basically to be number one by itself. So,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.000
yeah, just I don't want to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.800
say really a massive thank you to
everybody who bought the book.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.680
It's because of you
that the book is number one.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.640
And that's been amazing for me.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.280
It's like a great source of pride for me,
so thank you.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.360
It's also just given us unbelievable
growth of the channel like the YouTube.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.640
We only hit a hundred thousand
YouTube subs

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.280
just over a maybe a month ago.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.720
Six weeks ago.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.400
At the moment we're at 173 (thousand)
and it's still growing really quickly

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.160
and the insta is through 100,000.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.600
We got mentioned

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.520
in the House of Commons
an SNP MP mentioned

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.360
the work in the House of Commons.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.960
We had the the deputy head of the Green
Party tweeting about it yesterday.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.520
And so, you know, we’re

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.880
getting recognized by politicians
recognized all over the world.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.320
I'm getting

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.560
recognized in the street
about ten times a day.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.840
I've been touring across the country
I've been to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.440
Bath, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.800
I went up to Dublin and we've been
filling up big rooms in all those places.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.520
And it's just been it's been amazing.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.720
It's been overwhelming.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.520
I don’t really know what to say
it's been mad, but yeah,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.520
thank you for everyone who bought

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.360
the book who promoted the book,
who bought the audio book.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.160
You know, I hope you like my accent,
those who bought the audiobook.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah, everyone who's been following
the channel for years.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.520
And I hope you guys are enjoying,
you know, the growth

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.720
in the message and the growth
and the understanding of these ideas as...

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.160
I was going to say as much as I am.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.880
But to be honest,
I've been so unbelievably busy the last

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.440
month or six weeks,
I haven't really had much time to stop and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.360
take it all in.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.560
I've just been unbelievably busy doing

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.240
so much media,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.680
you know, just

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.160
newspapers, radio channels, podcasts.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.440
And the book has also been released

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.520
in the USA,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.480
Australia, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640
and I've been doing publicity
for those countries as well.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.520
So you might have just seen the UK
publicity.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.360
If you watch from the UK,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.320
but I’ve also been doing
all this international publicity as well.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
I should thank a few people

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.080
like obviously you read the book,
but behind the scenes

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.120
there's like a whole team.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.680
At Allen Lane
which is the in-print of Penguin

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.440
that published the book, there’s
my editors, there's a publicity team,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.760
there's a marketing team,
there's a sales team.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.760
They put out work in, and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.400
also like the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
the people who work at bookshops
and I've been getting sent photos

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.840
from across the country
of like window displays in bookshops.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.440
And it's not like, for example,
it doesn't come down from like Waterstones

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.360
head office,
like put Gary's book in the window.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.520
It's the individual staff at the stores
who decide what goes in the window.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.880
So, yeah,
just thank everyone who has helped.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.640
All of the guys who work at bookshops,
all the independent bookshops.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.960
All the guys at Waterstones.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.360
I've seen so many massive displays.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.400
Foyles here in London.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.240
On Tottenham Court Road
had a massive window display.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.120
So, you know, it's not just me.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.720
There's a whole team of people
that work towards

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.120
getting this book out and getting,
you know, all the publicity

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.480
we have that’s down to the publicity team
at Penguin who've been amazing.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.200
So, yeah, thank you to everyone

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.280
the guys at Penguin, the guys
at bookshops, but most of all you guys

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.680
for buying the book becaus
that's what gets the book to number one.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.680
And yeah, the people
who've been supporting the message

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.000
from the beginning, 
I just want to say I've been so busy

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.880
with book stuff the last week,
the last month it's been quite difficult

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.320
to do the YouTube
I’ve just been working so hard.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.160
But we’re getting it done.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.120
We're going to keep getting videos out
every week on economics.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.080
I just wanna encourage you.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080
You know,
the book is part of the political project.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.720
Like I love the book.
I think the book is really good.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.000
I put my heart and soul into it,
but it's part of a bigger picture project

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.560
and I'm hoping

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.560
you guys are seeing the growth in the channels and you’re realizing that, you know

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.120
that is going to help us grow the voice.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.560
Yeah so I hope you enjoy.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.120
Those you read the real book,
the physical book, the audio book, hope

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.360
you enjoyed that and keep sharing it.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.800
I brought some random stuff to show you
because you guys would have only seen

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.560
the English book but
I've got all the different versions here.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.840
So I thought I’d show you them
because I get sent them in the post.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.480
This is the UK version, which if you
watching in the UK, is the one you bought.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.880
We've
also had this one come out in the States.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.560
Also, this is Crown is the imprint

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.560
which is part of Penguin as well
that's out there in the States.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.320
This is the Dutch version,
Spelen Met Geld.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.080
I think its doing well there.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.400
We got some great press in the Dutch, I’ve

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.520
been swearing in far too much of my press
and there’s a massive Dutch.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.160
I've got the Dutch newspaper
which is like something in Dutch.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.720
The only word you can read is ‘fucking’,
which is typical of my press.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.080
This is the German version. Very intense.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.400
I've even got, this is a special American
this is like an advance proof you get

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.400
this is the never got published
this one maybe I’ll like

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.480
do some sort of give this to somebody
on the channel somehow

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.320
but yeah I don't know what to say.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.760
It's been mad it's really helped the
growth of the channel thanks to everyone

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.640
who's bought it

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.200
and supported it and people who’ve been
following on the channel from day one.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.320
All of the guys
who retweet my stuff on Twitter.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.040
All of the guys who share everything.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.240
Yeah, it's

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.120
really building up

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.760
the political project
and it's making me sort of realize

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.920
that if we keep going and maybe

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.760
we can start to change things.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.640
But yeah, there's a long way to go.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.080
Hopefully we'll get a film or TV series
made out of it. I'm

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.160
not allowed to talk too much about that,
but we've got a deal in progress.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.000
But look, we

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.240
do it for a reason.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.720
We do it because, you know,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.320
because
we don't want the economy to collapse.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.920
And we've got to try and stop it
from collapsing.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.800
So, yeah, keep following, keep sharing
and yeah, just like,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.560
just well done to us, to you for everyone

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.160
who's been following for a long time
and thanks for your support.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.680
And yeah, we'll keep going.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.680
I might take a holiday at some point.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.080
We'll keep going. Thank you.
