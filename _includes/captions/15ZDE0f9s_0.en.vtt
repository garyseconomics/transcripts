00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.560
I think we'll do another video on why economists,&nbsp;
mainstream economists have missed this so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.780
because it breaks my heart the pathetic idiocy&nbsp;we
see from economists so much um but the truth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.440
they're rich, they're from rich families, they're&nbsp;
from rich backgrounds, they're getting paid right

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.840
they don't give a **** right...

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.000
okay so this is going to be the final video in&nbsp;
the series about the 700 billion it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.960
cover how it ended up with the rich and how that&nbsp;
affects the economy, okay so we've been doing a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.420
of videos on this 700 billion recently I think&nbsp;
it's a really useful way to criticise the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.220
government and also to understand what's happened&nbsp;
in the economy uh the last video we did explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.820
exactly what the 700 billion was; it's the total&nbsp;
government deficit since the beginning of covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.880
which is the total amount of money essentially the&nbsp;
government has given out above and beyond taxes so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.320
when the government taxes it moves around but when&nbsp;
it gives extra out that creates more money in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.700
and someone ends up with more money um 700&nbsp;
billion pounds massive massive amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
£14,000 for everyone... every single adult&nbsp;
in the country um it was always going to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.880
massive economic effects, now a big part of the&nbsp;
argument of of this channel is that that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.580
has largely ended up with the richest um in fact&nbsp;
the reason why we made this channel is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.340
right at the beginning of covid it was pretty&nbsp;
clear to me that 250 billion pounds which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.460
how much it was then was going to end up with&nbsp;
the rich people in the country it was going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
transform inequality it was going to have massive&nbsp;
implications for ordinary people so that's why we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
made this channel and we made the very first&nbsp;
video on this channel so the very first video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.360
on this channel basically explains exactly&nbsp;
that how that money ended up with the richest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.180
um I'm not going to go through a completely&nbsp;
detailed explanation if you want that then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.920
go and watch that video we'll put a link in&nbsp;
the description we'll put a little pop-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.540
maybe for it so you can see that video but&nbsp;
I'm going to describe very very succinctly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.160
how that money ended up with the richest people&nbsp;
in society so since we know that £700 billion

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.260
was given out we must also know that somebody has&nbsp;
it because it's so much (£14,000 per adult)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.120
it raises quite a big question as to who because I&nbsp;
suspect that the vast majority of people watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.380
will not have accumulated £14,000 cash in&nbsp;
the last few years in fact most people will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.780
themselves poorer now than they were 3&nbsp;years ago 
um so it's a big question right who has the&nbsp;money&nbsp;

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.240
and it was a question that was&nbsp;puzzling me 
at the beginning of Covid-19 because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.760
at the beginning of Covid I think the narrative&nbsp;
was this money is going to furloughed workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.680
but if you look at furloughed workers they&nbsp;
didn't get richer right so we... 250 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.060
which is what it was then that's £5,000 per
adult in the country you know for&nbsp;every&nbsp;

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.200
furloughed worker it's something like £50,000&nbsp;
right because not everybody was furloughed 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000
or maybe something like £40,000, you know 
of course&nbsp;every furloughed worker is not &nbsp;

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
accumulating £40,000 remember the question 
here is not&nbsp;'who gets the money initially?' its&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.560
'who ends up accumulating the money?' you know 
we're&nbsp;pouring 250 billion, we're pouring 700 billion in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.560
it's going to swim around and it's going to end up&nbsp;
with some people who ends up with that 700 billion?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.840
right and it was a bit of a mystery to me at the&nbsp;
beginning of Covid right because the narrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.660
was all 'it's the furloughed workers' but the
furloughed workers weren't accumulating anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.400
in fact they're getting poorer because they're&nbsp;
getting less (80%) so it it raises the question of&nbsp;

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.380
'who actually ends up with the money?' &amp; all you need&nbsp;
to do is follow the money through the system right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.060
so furloughed workers they get extra money from&nbsp;
the government but they don't get richer because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.980
they don't get their wages anymore, okay so&nbsp;
who's got the wages? well it's companies that pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.140
the wages so but are company's getting richer? well&nbsp;
actually the companies who furloughed their workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.220
during Covid generally got poorer during Covid
because they were shut down they weren't getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.000
their income okay so who gets the income that&nbsp;
normally goes to companies that then gets paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.620
to the workers well that's customers and actually&nbsp;
this is where the money accumulates because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.300
customers massively cut their spending during 
Covid but crucially not all customers right if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.600
an ordinary family or especially if you're&nbsp;a poor 
family almost all of your expenses is&nbsp;essentials;&nbsp;

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:28.000
rent, mortgage, food, bills... these&nbsp;payments did not 
decrease during Covid, but if you're, well what payments

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.440
did decrease during Covid? the&nbsp;answer is non-essential 
or luxury&nbsp;payments; holidays, bars, restaurants...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.480
all of the things that were shut down basically&nbsp;
theater this kind of thing and who has the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.520
spending on those luxuries? it's basically&nbsp;
a perfect proxy for how rich you are so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.400
what happened during Covid &amp; during lockdown&nbsp;
was that the spending specifically of the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.680
collapsed, poor people spending barely fell&nbsp;
at all but the spending of the rich collapsed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.980
which meant that anybody who worked in the luxury&nbsp;
non-essential sector lost their incomes and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.600
government stood in to fill the gap so essentially&nbsp;
systemically what happened during Covid was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.300
an expenditure of the rich got replaced&nbsp;
by an expenditure of the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.320
which meant that the government&nbsp;
printed largely and pumped money in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.360
that went to ordinary workers they use that to&nbsp;
pay their bills, their rent, their mortgage; that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.980
goes to that the owners of the assets who are the&nbsp;
rich and the rich simply it was basically illegal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.060
for them to spend that money so what it meant was&nbsp;
that the rich accumulated that money and this was

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.560
so systemically obvious at the beginning&nbsp;
of Covid and so unbelievably unbelievably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.380
little analysed I think it was I think it's I&nbsp;
think it's the most fantastic indictment of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.100
state of Economics today that in the last&nbsp;
three years the government of this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.940
has given out seven billion and I looked at the&nbsp;
U.S number and I think it was 3 trillion right

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.580
that governments can give out trillions of&nbsp;
pounds and nobody even asked the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.700
of 'who is going to accumulate that money?' it's&nbsp;
it's and you know we'll probably do a video on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.140
this at some point but what that comes down to&nbsp;
is there is a there is a terrible woeful lack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.400
of analysis of distribution in economics so&nbsp;
that no one even asks the question basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.100
um but you know the government gave out 
£14,000&nbsp;per adult somebody had to have it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.420
if you do the analysis which I've just gone&nbsp;
through it's quite obvious that that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.620
will end up with the richest because that money&nbsp;
has gone in it's basically as a subsidy for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.140
collapsed spending of the rich so so it was it&nbsp;
was unbelievably obvious at the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.280
covid that what we would see is the biggest and&nbsp;
fastest increase in inequality in the history&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.580
of the country and if you have an unbelievably&nbsp;
rapid increase in inequality during a period of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.320
time when the economy is literally closed it is&nbsp;
really obvious that on reopen what you'll see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.460
is a massive increase in quality of life of the&nbsp;rich
&amp; a massive decrease in quality of life in&nbsp;the poor&nbsp;

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.800
what else could you possibly expect&nbsp;if you've 
increased inequality enormously in&nbsp;a period

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.780
when the economy was closed &amp; the... 
I&nbsp;don't know if you remember but the reporting&nbsp;

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.080
the media reporting during covid was just about the&nbsp;
stupidest thing you have ever heard right they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.700
were like everybody's accumulating so much money&nbsp;
we're going to have a Roaring Twenties you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.800
you don't create Roaring Twenties just by&nbsp;
giving money out right if you give if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.060
give a huge amount of money specifically to the&nbsp;
rich what you create is a cost of living crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.040
and this brings us to the next point of the video&nbsp;okay 
so we're concluding now how the money ended up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.840
with the richest hopefully it's clear if anybody&nbsp;
wants to understand more go back and watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.440
the very first video on this channel we'll put&nbsp;
a link in the description it's called 'how the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.900
rich got richer from Covid-19' but the next question 
I&nbsp;think this is a really interesting discussion is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.920
how does it affect you and how does it affect&nbsp;
the economy so there's lots and lots of ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.880
in which wealth inequality can increase in society&nbsp;
the most obvious way is that ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.780
lose their assets and those assets start to be&nbsp;
owned by richer families the direct&nbsp;transfer

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.760
of assets from the middle class to the&nbsp;rich 
that's happening you know you can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.480
that tends to happen generationally so what you 
see&nbsp;is middle class families; the older generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.900
own property the younger generation cannot afford its&nbsp;
own property those properties end up being owned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.000
by the younger generations of richer families so&nbsp;
generationally assets are being transferred from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.800
middle class to the rich that's one way inequality&nbsp;
can increase another way wealth inequality can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.440
increase is is debt a big increase in debt from&nbsp;
the middle class to the rich and we're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.100
that as well in the massive increase in size&nbsp;
of mortgages and also matter increasing size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.620
of government debt okay that's another way that&nbsp;
inequality can increase I think both of those if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.400
you do them slowly enough people don't recognise&nbsp;
right like generationally the older generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.480
doesn't realise their kids are losing property&nbsp;
younger people are kind of realising I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.320
um the increase in debt it happens slowly people&nbsp;
don't really really notice it that much but people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.680
don't like it people don't like having a lot of&nbsp;
debt and people don't like losing their assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.700
but what happened during Covid was a massive&nbsp;
increase in inequality without taking your assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.940
and without putting you into&nbsp;
debt and what that was was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.720
printing a crap ton of money and giving it to the&nbsp;
rich does that hurt you? and how does it hurt you?&nbsp;

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.820
you know I think it's really worth just sitting&nbsp;
and asking yourself the question and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.260
people watching you might even want to pause the&nbsp;
video and ask yourself the question what do I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.480
think would happen let's assume that money went to&nbsp;
top 10% so you give the richest 5 million adults in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:43.200
the country each £140,000 cash, what do you think&nbsp;
would happen? stop for a minute and think what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.420
would happen if the government gave the richest 
5&nbsp;million adults in the country each £140,000 cash

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.540
well the first thing is they're going to buy&nbsp;
assets so you're going to see assets go up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.740
because rich people tend to prefer to buy assets&nbsp;
but they already own assets right so that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.860
just buying assets from each other there will&nbsp;
be some net transfer of assets from the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:08.160
class the rich so some assets will go up but they&nbsp;
can't buy enough assets because they've been given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.380
so much money so asset prices go up then they feel&nbsp;
even richer and then if then they start increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.880
their spending right they start increasing their&nbsp;
spending that pushes up the prices of everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.920
you know one of the big reasons why food became&nbsp;
more expensive even before the Ukraine war was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.600
because the cost of shipping became more expensive&nbsp;
because the rich were buying so much stuff that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.820
was filling up the shipping containers you&nbsp;
know ultimately these guys they spend more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.140
money it pushes the price of stuff up and people&nbsp;
sometimes turn them out to me and say oh but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.540
say the rich have like they prefer to save which&nbsp;
is true it's true the rich prefer to save but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.700
don't save everything if you give 5 million&nbsp;people 
140 Grand each you're going to push the&nbsp;prices&nbsp;of

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.400
stuff up it's such an enormous amount&nbsp;of money 
such an enormous amount of money &amp; I think

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.940
it's interesting because it's a really&nbsp;
interesting way to make people poorer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.900
to print money and give it to the rich because&nbsp;
you don't even see it happening right, you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.200
it happens behind closed doors you know and in&nbsp;
fact what most people think is the government is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.580
really good they gave money to furloughed workers&nbsp;
you know but if you actually ask a question of who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.460
ended up with the money then what you see is a&nbsp;
massive massive transfer of cash to the rich and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.060
what I think is quite interesting if you&nbsp;
were to ask an economist that question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.200
five years ago before Covid, what do you think
would happen if we gave the richest 5 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.920
adults in the country 140 Grand each&nbsp;
they would all say to you - inflation crisis

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.000
they would all say that to you
they would all say that to you

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.060
and yet what happened was we did that&nbsp;
we immediately had an inflation crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.440
and everybody says well because of the war in&nbsp;
Ukraine and you know you will remember it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.280
you know when this channel was, the invasion of&nbsp;
Ukraine was when this channel was much smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and I called you up and I was like this is gonna&nbsp;be 
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disaster you know of course the war&nbsp;itself&nbsp;

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is a disaster right but looking at it&nbsp;just purely 
from the perspective of Western Economies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.680
the British Economy; I said what this&nbsp;will do
is it will take entirely the blame for&nbsp;the&nbsp;

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.240
inflationary crisis they will blame it all&nbsp;
on Ukraine and people don't remember but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.560
inflationary crisis started before the invasion&nbsp;
of Ukraine right um and it was always inevitably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.660
going to happen in my opinion but as soon as that&nbsp;
all happened I was like this is I cannot tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.280
you what a disaster this is for our economy and&nbsp;
for the future of our our society and I I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.240
at all want to undermine what's happened to the&nbsp;
people of Ukraine that it's of course a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.260
right for I am a British Economist my job is to&nbsp;
analyse the UK economy as soon as that happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.800
it was a disaster for Western European economies&nbsp;
and the American economy because if that hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.200
have happened we would still have seen a mass&nbsp;
inflationary crisis and it would have been&nbsp;very&nbsp;

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.760
difficult to blame it on anything other than&nbsp;this 
massive accumulation of cash of the rich during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.720
Covid but as soon as that war happens&nbsp;you have 
a very easy scapegoat it's because&nbsp;of the war&nbsp;

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.800
it's because of the war and it means that&nbsp;what's 
happened is the biggest ever transfer of&nbsp;wealth&nbsp;

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.980
from the government to the richest people&nbsp;in the
world, in the history of the world, followed&nbsp;by&nbsp;

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.720
the most obvious consequences you would have&nbsp;
predicted; an increase in inequality and increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.580
in asset prices, an increase in cost of living,&nbsp;
decreasing quality of life for ordinary people

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.840
and no one is even talking about the accumulation&nbsp;
of cash by the rich it is coming in a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.720
you know you know and we try to raise that up the&nbsp;
profile as much as we can but you know I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.740
really encourage anybody watching this video now&nbsp;
if you haven't seen it go back and watch the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.320
video on this channel came out in June 2020 right&nbsp;
before the inflation crisis or any of this it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.960
in the middle of lockdown um and I said what&nbsp;
you'll see is massive increase in inequality, massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.300
increase in inflation, massive increase in asset&nbsp;
prices and ordinary people will be thrown into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.940
poverty and probably austerity, all of those&nbsp;
things have happened okay and it's you know

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:02.700
the reason I was right then is the same reason&nbsp;
I've been right for ****ing 15 years because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.600
understand that the distribution is important&nbsp;
to the economy which is something that most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:13.800
economists miss and you know if you massively&nbsp;
increase inequality when the economy is closed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.360
how can you expect not to cause a decrease&nbsp;
in living standards? where has the increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.980
wealth of the rich come from if not from poverty&nbsp;
for the rest? you know if they become richer they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.540
will take a larger share of the resources you&nbsp;
know and and I think we'll do another video on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.460
why economists mainstream economists have missed&nbsp;
this so much because it it breaks my heart the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:39.900
pathetic idiocy we see from economists so much&nbsp;
um but the truth is they're rich they're from rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.300
families, they're from rich backgrounds, they're&nbsp;
getting paid they don't give a **** right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.820
um people need to be aware that inequality has&nbsp;
increased massively in the last three years and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:57.900
that when inequality increases, broad living&nbsp;
standards fall, not only that but it creates a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.300
spiral effect because the end result is ordinary&nbsp;
families will sell their assets to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.080
themselves which means they get poorer still which&nbsp;
means wealth inequality inequality gets bigger still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.640
you know another video which people should&nbsp;watch 
if they're here watching now is the flows of&nbsp;wealth

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.680
video which makes it clear once inequality&nbsp;
gets big it starts to spiral out of control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.320
so the end message here is number&nbsp;
one that money went to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.180
number two if you give the rich a ton of money it&nbsp;
creates inflation and makes ordinary people poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.040
number three that creates increased&nbsp;
flows of wealth from the middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.040
to the rich which makes the situation&nbsp;
worse still so you know really this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.220
is a dire emergency situation I can't put I&nbsp;
can't put any finer a point of it on that um

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.160
um but unfortunately most economists from rich&nbsp;
families from rich backgrounds getting well paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.460
studied for many years not looking at inequality&nbsp;
at all they will not fix this they will not fix&nbsp;this&nbsp;

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.420
honestly they will not fix this and you
know the reason I made this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.620
is because I am very aware&nbsp;
if nothing is done about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.740
the economy will collapse very&nbsp;
seriously in the coming years so

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.820
this is why I go on and on about 700 billion&nbsp;
pounds you know um and it will be 800 and it'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:27.780
be 900 and I will keep the viewers informed with&nbsp;
what it is um but something has to be done but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.780
I think using this number is is a great&nbsp;
opportunity I've spoken about the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.380
to attack the government and not just in this&nbsp;
country in the U.S I think it's *eight* trillion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.040
I'll put the exact U.S number in the description&nbsp;
because I know we do have some viewers in the U.S&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.400
um ask them where the money is now because they&nbsp;
cannot answer that question they cannot ask that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.140
question and if they did answer that question then&nbsp;
it would be unbelievably painfully obvious what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:58.320
have to do to fix this crisis if we were to tax&nbsp;back 
the rich just enough to make them as rich as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.400
they were 3 years ago we would have enough 
to&nbsp;give every single adult in this entire country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.980
£14,000 each and this crisis would&nbsp;
be over um so go at em and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:18.600
write to your MP, call into the radio station, go&nbsp;
on the news, put it on your Facebook, tell your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.880
friends and family, follow us on everything; TikTok, 
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter of course YouTube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:30.180
share these videos um and let's get something&nbsp;
done about it man because if nothing is done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.760
things get worse and worse but we can make change&nbsp;
if we're willing to, to hold these guys to account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.320
rich ****ers

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.320
money currently is flowing&nbsp;from the 
government to the rich leaving the

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.420
government with big piles of debt and the&nbsp;
rich with big piles of money there's one other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.320
thing they can do with that mass amount&nbsp;
of income they can buy your mom's house
