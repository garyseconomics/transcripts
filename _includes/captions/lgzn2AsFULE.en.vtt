00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
The fact that government finances were

The fact that government finances were

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
so bad was basically exactly the reason
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.789 align:start position:0%
so bad was basically exactly the reason
I<00:01:46.799><c> was</c><00:01:46.880><c> able</c><00:01:47.119><c> to</c><00:01:47.280><c> predict</c><00:01:47.600><c> that</c><00:01:48.240><c> Labor</c><00:01:48.560><c> would</c>

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
problem. It is a much much bigger
 

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.590 align:start position:0%

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.909 align:start position:0%
problem than the Labor Party. It's
basically<00:30:32.080><c> happening</c><00:30:32.480><c> to</c><00:30:32.880><c> every</c><00:30:33.440><c> single</c>
