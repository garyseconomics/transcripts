00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.600
Welcome back to Gary's Economics, today we&nbsp;are going 
to talk about Jeremy&nbsp;Hunt and his "Black Swan" events...

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.880
Okay so for those who don't know Jeremy Hunt is&nbsp;
the new Chancellor of the United Kingdom he's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.680
guy in charge of your economy um I'm a big fan&nbsp;
of Jeremy Hunt one of the first videos we ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.780
put up on the channel explained how Jeremy Hunt&nbsp;
is able to buy houses without paying stamp duty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.300
because he buys them 7 at a time &amp; there's&nbsp;
a special uh exclusion in stamp duty for anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.740
who buys more than 7 houses at once so he's&nbsp;
a very wise man he's very good with his taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.240
um but today we're going to talk about&nbsp;
Jeremy Hunt's recent speech that he gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.580
so um obviously as you know the UK economy is&nbsp;
in a bit of a mess there's a lot of problems a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.940
lot of big problems for ordinary people and&nbsp;
Jeremy Hunt's talking about how he's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.320
to fix it and I watched the speech here um in&nbsp;
the morning and it was largely a lot of empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.900
platitudes not particularly important but there&nbsp;
was one line which really caught my attention as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.120
I was playing it in the background and it's where he&nbsp;
said that "in the last 10 years we've been faced by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.580
a string of Black Swan events in the economy"&nbsp;
so a 'Black Swan' in economics is is basically a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.480
very rare event black swans are very rare so black&nbsp;
swan events are not supposed to happen very often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.000
um and this idea that the reason the economy&nbsp;
is weak is because we keep getting hit by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.320
string of of of bad luck basically is um it's&nbsp;
a it's a little bit triggering for me because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
my history for those who know on the channel is&nbsp;
I was a trader for a long time and I spent a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.040
of time betting that the economy would&nbsp;
be very weak and those bets continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.180
be right year after year and the economy&nbsp;has
continued to be weak year after year and um

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.860
if you ask many economists why the&nbsp;
economy has been weak in the last 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.060
15 years what they would often say is that is&nbsp;
this basically we've been faced by a string of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.500
very unlucky things that happened first&nbsp;
we had the 2008 'Financial Crisis' then we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.900
had the 2011 'Sovereign Debt Crisis' then we&nbsp;had 
'Covid' (2020) now we've had the 'Ukraine War'&nbsp;(2022)&nbsp;

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
and bad things keep happening and that's why&nbsp;
the economy keeps getting worse and worse um

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.520
and I think it's it's very problematic when the&nbsp;
people who are in charge of your economy when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.420
the economy continually has very bad outcomes&nbsp;
for poor and ordinary people have very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.440
outcomes for very wealthy people like Jeremy&nbsp;
Hunt who is himself a very very wealthy man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.580
um when they say the reason it's happened&nbsp;
is just because we keep being phenomenally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.920
unlucky like imagine if you had a doctor who&nbsp;
every single patient that went to him died and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.880
when you asked him why do all your patients&nbsp;
die what he said was well I keep just being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.000
really unlucky and getting really really&nbsp;
sick patients and there's nothing we can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.640
um I think that this is a line which we are&nbsp;
going to hear a lot from from economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240
and politicians which is that there's nothing&nbsp;
that can be done because we keep being unlucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.140
um and it's important to understand that what&nbsp;
has happened in the last 10-15 years especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.220
in the last 3-4 years since Covid, was in&nbsp;no way 
unpredictable or unexpected, so in Jeremy Hunt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.380
we have a man here who is very wealthy has&nbsp;been 
part of a government which has presided over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.440
the largest and fastest ever increase in&nbsp;
inequality in the history of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.100
he himself has no doubt benefited massively&nbsp;the 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has benefited massively

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.140
and when he's confronted with the question&nbsp;
of why is the economy been bad he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.780
"well we just keep getting Black Swan events we&nbsp;
keep getting unlucky things happening" and there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.000
no recognition there's no acknowledgment of this&nbsp;
structural problem which is that inequality keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
getting worse and worse and the problem is they&nbsp;
can keep making this argument again and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.940
right the economy will get worse and worse it&nbsp;
will get worse in predictable ways because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.360
rich have got richer they'll use that money to buy&nbsp;
the assets to the middle class, the middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.580
will get poorer that means less spending power&nbsp;
in the economy, that means lower wages,&nbsp;

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.840
that means poorer living standards for ordinary 
people;&nbsp;all of these things are super predictable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.340
but they can always be blamed on the&nbsp;
events that happen at any given time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.700
so there's no doubt that when things get worse and&nbsp;
worse two three four years down the line and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.420
know it could even be a labour government by then&nbsp;
they will turn around to whatever happens to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.820
the most recent news story and say it was because&nbsp;
of of that thing that happened and um the only way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.400
that you ordinary people can defend yourself&nbsp;
against that is to understand what is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.020
happening which is that we have a structural&nbsp;
worsening crisis of inequality that will lead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.560
to predictable understandable bad outcomes um I&nbsp;
will keep telling you what will happen um just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.180
I did from the beginning of Covid and you need to&nbsp;
be prepared to throw this stuff back in the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.960
of politicians like Jeremy Hunt basically don't&nbsp;let 
them tell you that the reason that they keep&nbsp;getting&nbsp;

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.400
richer &amp; richer and you keep getting poor&nbsp;&amp; poorer 
is because you're just phenomenally&nbsp;unlucky&nbsp;

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.080
this is a system which as it is set up&nbsp;now 
is guaranteed to drive ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.400
into poverty and um you need to fight back to&nbsp;
stop it from happening so yeah don't accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.680
nonsense from Jeremy Hunt and his best mate&nbsp;
Rishi Sunak um they're making a fortune it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.260
just ordinary people that are not so um yep the&nbsp;
Jeremy Hunt and his Black Swan Events good luck

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.520
because we are draining the resources of&nbsp;this economy 
and giving it to the super&nbsp;rich who do not pay any tax

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.920
yeah he's&nbsp;my boy man he's my boy, I like to see&nbsp;a billionaire 
just take the mask off for&nbsp;once &amp; just directly rob everyone
