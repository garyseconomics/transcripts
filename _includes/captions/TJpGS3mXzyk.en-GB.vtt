there's<00:16:06.420><c> a</c><00:16:06.600><c> question</c><00:16:06.720><c> here</c><00:16:06.899><c> of</c><00:16:07.079><c> like</c><00:16:07.259><c> why</c><00:16:07.620><c> do</c>

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's a question here of like why do
 

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.889 align:start position:0%
there's a question here of like why do
we<00:16:07.920><c> accept</c><00:16:08.100><c> this</c><00:16:08.399><c> why</c><00:16:08.880><c> do</c><00:16:09.060><c> people</c><00:16:09.240><c> accept</c><00:16:09.600><c> this</c>

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
we accept this why do people accept this

right like why and I think a problem
 

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.170 align:start position:0%
right like why and I think a problem
with<00:16:13.500><c> it</c><00:16:13.680><c> is</c><00:16:13.860><c> what</c><00:16:14.100><c> you</c><00:16:14.279><c> say</c><00:16:14.459><c> which</c><00:16:14.699><c> is</c><00:16:14.820><c> we've</c>

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
with it is what you say which is we've

know<00:20:57.240><c> we</c><00:20:57.419><c> can</c><00:20:57.539><c> still</c><00:20:57.720><c> have</c><00:20:57.900><c> that</c><00:20:58.080><c> now</c><00:20:58.380><c> so</c><00:20:58.980><c> um</c><00:20:59.460><c> I</c>

00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
know we can still have that now so um I
 

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.370 align:start position:0%
know we can still have that now so um I

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
think it's possible and I wouldn't do
 

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
think it's possible and I wouldn't do
this<00:21:01.500><c> if</c><00:21:01.679><c> I</c><00:21:01.799><c> didn't</c><00:21:01.860><c> think</c><00:21:02.039><c> it's</c><00:21:02.100><c> possible</c><00:21:02.400><c> you</c>

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
this if I didn't think it's possible you
 

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.549 align:start position:0%
this if I didn't think it's possible you
know<00:21:02.760><c> like</c><00:21:03.299><c> you</c><00:21:03.539><c> I</c><00:21:03.720><c> left</c><00:21:03.840><c> a</c><00:21:04.020><c> job</c><00:21:04.140><c> that</c><00:21:04.320><c> was</c><00:21:04.440><c> a</c>

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
know like you I left a job that was a
 

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:05.810 align:start position:0%
know like you I left a job that was a
well-paid<00:21:04.860><c> job</c><00:21:05.039><c> because</c><00:21:05.220><c> I</c><00:21:05.460><c> think</c><00:21:05.520><c> we</c><00:21:05.700><c> can</c>

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
well-paid job because I think we can
 

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.789 align:start position:0%
well-paid job because I think we can
make<00:21:05.940><c> things</c><00:21:06.120><c> better</c><00:21:06.360><c> so</c><00:21:06.539><c> yeah</c><00:21:07.380><c> no</c><00:21:07.559><c> it's</c>
