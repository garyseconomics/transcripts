00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.680
My name is Gary Stevenson -  former trader and
people's economist. This is Gary's Economics.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.960
Now today we're going to do something a little
bit different, since i started doing this channel

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.640
i've spoken a lot about how i made a lot&nbsp;of
money in the city and i've also spoken about

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.160
how i came from a poor background, we've had
a lot of messages from people who want to

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.320
know more about the background where i grew
up, if i really am from that kind of background

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.640
so recently my parents told me that um they're
selling the house and they're moving to south

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
coast somewhere so i figured i would bring
you to the house i grew up in and show you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440
what my life was like growing up
so here's the house i grew up in

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.000
- Hi Gary
Hey how's it going, go in shall we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.280
okay so this is my old bedroom, it's pretty
different now, like growing up i used to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.200
share this with my older brother so
there was like a bunk bed&nbsp;in this corner

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.320
and i was in the bottom bunk here
i could look outta this window um

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.920
yeah you can see&nbsp;it's not massive
i used to keep all of my stuff in like

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.280
a couple of drawers that just went under
the bed um there was a computer here

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.800
my brother&nbsp;used to learn to program which
someone from church&nbsp;gave us for free

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
and hes a programmer now but yeah
i grew up here just sleeping under there

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.200
um&nbsp;you can see there's a railway track
just back here, there's a train going past

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
um i've spoken a couple&nbsp;of my videos
about how my dad used to wake up

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.160
really early like 5-5.30am and he would
go down&nbsp;to Seven Kings station and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.800
he would get the train&nbsp;into work every
morning and it would go&nbsp;past here

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.440
and my mom would wake us up, we'd
look out and try and wave to my dad

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.000
see if&nbsp;we could see him on the train
like super early in&nbsp;the morning

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that's like one of my earliest&nbsp;memories
growing up but yeah this is&nbsp;my bedroom

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.840
where i grew up i shared it with my&nbsp;brother
and um let's go down to the front room

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.360
okay so this is um this is the front room
this is&nbsp;the biggest room in the house

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.680
the nicest room you&nbsp;can see the
sun coming in from the windows

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.560
um growing up it was me, both my
parents and my brother and my sister

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.560
so it was often pretty&nbsp;crowded in here
um but i had a little mega drive

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.600
i'd play sonic the hedgehog down here
um now when&nbsp;i was 16 i was expelled

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.480
from school and i remember at that time
i would wake up in the morning&nbsp;and um

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.800
there would be no one in the house
my parents would be at work and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.760
my&nbsp;brother and sister be at school so
that was the time when i would spend

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.960
the most time basically in this room
you know we didn't like have a desk

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.360
really in the house to study so we
used to get a little&nbsp;plank of wood

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.080
and i'd put it on the floor here
and i would lie down here and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.360
i would do all my maths homework
and my french homework for GCSEs

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.600
that's when i spent a lot of time in this
room and&nbsp;obviously that time was like

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.840
having been&nbsp;expelled from school
i was like very, it meant&nbsp;a lot to me

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.360
that i did well in the exams so i spent
a&nbsp;lot of time lying down on this floor

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.560
studying and i did well
what did i get - 8 A*'s &amp; 3 A's

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.400
study hard for your exams guys um
yeah that's the&nbsp;front room and i think

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.440
we'll just show the bathroom&nbsp;and
the garden quickly yeah we do that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.000
okay so this is the bathroom, i wanted
to show&nbsp;the bathroom because i've got

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.400
a couple of memories of this bathroom
growing up um one thing&nbsp;i remember is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.760
my first ever day interning at&nbsp;Citibank
when i was 20 years old, i had to get

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.800
into&nbsp;the office at 7am it was in December
so that meant&nbsp;leaving here at 6am

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.200
and um i remember now we got&nbsp;one of
these showers here you get this like little

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.000
stick on thing from Argos and you put it
on the taps&nbsp;and then you like

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.320
you use this little shower head
you hold it, you sit in the bath

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.800
i remember like&nbsp;waking up at like
5am and sitting in this like bath tub

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.920
which was very cold on a December
morning and showering myself up before

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.880
getting the train into Canary Wharf
for my&nbsp;first day at Citibank um

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.200
and i also remember&nbsp;um the day after
i got expelled when i was 16

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.440
waking up and&nbsp;my brother and sister
were at school, i think my brother was

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.920
already working then and my parents
were at work and um yeah waking up

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.000
the only person&nbsp;in the house and coming
down and sitting in this&nbsp;bathtub

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.320
with this handheld this handheld shower

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.800
and um showering and watching
the water go down&nbsp;the drain and uh

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.200
just watching the water go down
and thinking yeah that's going to

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.000
be your life if you don't do something
about it so um&nbsp;yeah that's why i was

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.200
studying so much in that&nbsp;front room
um that's the bathroom yeah so uh

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.000
my mom says you've gotta go to the garden
yeah so we'll go through to the garden yeah

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.840
just watch your footing around here

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.840
so this is the garden we do have a little bit of a
garden even though as i think you're about to see

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.360
there are trains going past right here this is
the main line out from Essex into London

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.640
yeah my mum wants to show the hydrangeas she's
been working on hard she's going to lose them

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.360
soon when she moves out but yeah we didn't spend
much time here the sun is on the other side um

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.320
but yeah i could see out from
the bedroom into here and um

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.080
yeah it wasn't too bad we've got some trees out
here in this, that's basically it one other thing

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.120
what was i supposed to show you yeah my little
clay painting i made when i was 12 little clay

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.920
portrait of the house so that's it yeah so it's
not a big house but it meant a lot to me and um

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.840
yeah this is where i grew up um it was small
it was crowded with five people but it was um

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.840
it was where i lived so yeah that's it we're
gonna show you a little bit outside the front

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.480
so this is the outside of the house i just
wanted to show a few things that have changed

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.360
basically since i was a kid so we used to have
like a kind of abandoned factory here at the end

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.280
that we would climb over the gates and play in
you can see now it's like a massive block of flats

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.400
that really like overlooks the street um yeah
i've got nothing against that but i guess it's

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.200
a bit strange for me like just being here when it
didn't used to be there big great block of flats

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.560
yeah i was talking to my mate the other day who
used to live down there so he doesn't like coming

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.240
down anymore just because it sort of
um makes him feel strange to see like

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.280
this massive block of flats where we used to be
able to see the sky i suppose there's another one

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.760
over there can you see the one there that's new as
well that used to be a swimming pool we used to go

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.760
for i think like one pound as kids go swimming
in the swimming pool that's a block of flats too

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.240
so there's no swimming pool now i think
these guys are getting loft conversion

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.080
there's another block of flats over there which i
think is just out of shot and beyond that there's

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.720
i think a 40-story block of flats um which
is massive there was nothing like that in

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.280
ilford when i was a kid growing up so yeah my
dad was saying it's just filling the place up

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.800
um yeah i know people need houses i'm not
complaining against it but just saying um

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.360
yeah this place has changed since i was a kid
a lot more flat a lot more crowded but um still

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.840
it's a nice street in a way i enjoy going up here
we're going to show a few things on the street

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.560
so this street like it don't connect to no street
so there's not a lot of traffic&nbsp;and the kids used

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.240
to play out on the road my mum says they still
do i used to know everyone, Aron one of my

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.360
best friends used to live here. Lee Jones&nbsp;lived
over there he wasn't one of my best friends

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.280
Andrew and John Parker lived here they were
good&nbsp;guys i used to go around their house to

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.840
play megadrive before i had the megadrive
not just that&nbsp;they're my mates as well obviously

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.400
in case they're&nbsp;watching and uh Bradley used to
live there and&nbsp;there was another Bradley with his

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.880
brother Justin&nbsp;and their little brother Ricardo
who live&nbsp;up there yeah like all the kids will be out

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.760
in the street all the time playing and um it's
a Wednesday today so there's nobody playing

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:25.840
but i guess on a sunny day like this they
still do let's take it to the end of the street

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.520
it's funny like when i was a kid the street
seemed like so long you know what i mean

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.240
this is where Anthony Silverstone used to
live he was like my absolute idol growing up

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.080
very funny, very sporty guy and then this
was&nbsp;Kelly his next-door neighbour

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.080
 *I've got a question&nbsp;- where did Tyrone live?*

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.040
Tyrone was like in the middle we ain't&nbsp;talking
about Tyrone man, Tyrone was trouble

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.160
still is probably, this was the Jattinder family
don't know their surname they come out and we

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.320
used to play football down here so we're gonna
show let's see this new sign i don't know if you

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.000
can see this no ball game sign i don't know when
they added that but you see down here at the end

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.840
there's this telegraph pole on this lamp pole

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.040
and uh obviously it's made for playing football
we used to play football here all the time these

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.160
houses weren't there it was like a kind of garden
like warehouse or something yeah we used to

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.720
play football it always used to go over into this
man's uh fence they put this this is new this

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.160
fence we used to keep the ball over all the time
and we had to go all the way around to climb over

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.560
and i remember one kid came down from a couple
streets down and he just jumped straight

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.560
over that wall like kicked off it and jumped
over it when we was about 15 and we was like

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.520
blew our minds but yeah we used to
play football down here all the time

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.000
there's a no ball game sign here now but i'm
guessing people probably still do play football

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:00.400
we'll show you the bridge yeah okay so this is the
bridge this goes over the railway and connects

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.840
my street to the rest of Ilford which
is on the north side of this railway

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.560
so my primary school my grammar school my
comprehensive school they're all on the other

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.560
side of this so i started crossing this every
single day from when i was 4 or 5 years old

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:30.160
i remember crossing it with my brother
as you can see it's a very long bridge

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.440
to be honest it was quite dangerous
growing up my dad was saying

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.800
that even now he won't cross it in the night
time, Anthony got beaten up one time on

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.120
this bridge and had to go hospital i remember
one time two guys tried to mug me just here

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.000
i remember just listening to them all the names
of&nbsp;the people that i knew hoping that we knew

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.400
someone because i lived literally just here
eventually&nbsp;they decided not to mug me so

00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.160
but yeah i crossed this and back every day and
um it was dangerous and it was scary but um

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.080
if anything happened l just used to run away
so&nbsp;that's how it is, I had a bright future i'm

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.840
not losing it to fight someone on this bridge
but yeah this iron bridge so well known in Ilford

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.120
this is where i come from if you come from a place
like this and you know it doesn't have to be in

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.800
London it could be in Manchester or Birmingham
or Newcastle or you know Northern Ireland, Wales

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.720
it could be in another country right if you come
for a place like this you're not going to hear

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:42.240
many voices like yours or like mine talking about
economics what you are going to hear is voices

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.600
paid for by billionaires telling you you shouldn't
tax billionaires now look i don't get paid to do

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.120
this youtube doesn't pay me to do this
the&nbsp;reason i do this is because i worked in a

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.120
city and my job was to analyze the economy and the
result of my analysis was if we don't do anything

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.960
people like me and the people here and from
places like here are going to struggle and

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.800
their kids lives will be even harder than their
lives and their lives will get worse over time

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.520
that's what will happen if we don't do anything
about wealth inequality but the newspapers which

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.960
are very often owned by billionaires and the
politicians who often are billionaires themselves

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.640
are not gonna to say that but i'm going to
say that because i want to make things better

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.160
so look there's a voice here that is representing
your interests in economics and um if you want to

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.800
make things better for ordinary people then
it's important that voice gets heard so check

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.440
out my website check out my videos, share this
voice and um let's let people know that the way

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.600
things go with the economy might be good for
the&nbsp;billionaires and millionaires who talk on tv

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.600
but it's not good for ordinary people let's spread a
different message about how we can make the

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.000
world better for ordinary people like the people that
live here and the people who live where you live

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.760
and we're going to start that by talking
about the tax system in our next video

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.720
about what's happened to changes in a tax
system raising national insurance payments

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.320
which is ordinary tax on people like you while the
billionaires don't have to pay anything so yeah

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.240
check out my next video on tax
and share this video thank you

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.640
is that good? *yeah perfect*

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.120
-Hi i don't know if you can see the
likeness,&nbsp;he's short like me

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.080
