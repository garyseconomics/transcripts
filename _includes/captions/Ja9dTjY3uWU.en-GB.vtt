00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.520
okay welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.040
today is unfortunately my goodbye video for now

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.320
because this will be the last video in the 24/25

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.960
season, thank you

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.480
Okay so this is it

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.240
the last video while I go away

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.920
if you watch this I'll probably already be in Italy

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.320
I wanted to just talk

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.800
I've got here written on my script

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.280
just run with no script, but I can't to be honest

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.640
I'm absolutely knackered

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.520
I wanna talk a little bit about this season

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.800
and this season has been, I would say

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.720
probably the hardest season for me personally

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.440
of Gary's Economics if I'm honest

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.800
I think I probably exhausted myself a little bit

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.240
in the first half of the year

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.640
it seems ages ago now but the paperback came out in

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.880
end of January

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.320
and the first half of the year was absolutely insane

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.360
for me, it was absolutely crazy

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.400
I was everywhere

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.920
it felt like I couldn't live my life really

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.680
we were getting like 50 million views a month

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.840
it really felt like we were gonna take the world over

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200
and I was working crazy crazy

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.920
crazy crazy hard and really

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.440
really really

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.920
really hard

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.040
I didn't realise it was gonna go on as long as it did

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.920
it just kept going and going and going

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.840
and I had a holiday planned in the spring

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320
which I kept postponing and postponing and postponing

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.080
and the holiday ended up being quite short

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.960
and I ended up working half the holiday

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.680
doing interviews all over the place

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.560
and then when I came back in June to start this season

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.040
it really felt like we were kind of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.680
on the edge of winning wealth taxes

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.600
and I really wanted to like

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.120
hit the ground running and really go

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240
and I started making videos in June

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880
and it was probably only about 3, 4

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.360
videos in, I just started feeling like I was exhausted

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.160
to be honest

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.640
and I don't know if it's just me getting old

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
or if I worked too hard but it was

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.680
it was difficult for me because

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.120
we'd achieved so much and we'd come so close

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.200
it really felt like what it needed was for me to like

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.840
keep pushing and push more and more and more

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.160
it just felt like, the sort of the legs weren't there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.840
I didn't have the energy I needed to really run in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.960
it felt like when I'm really doing a lot of work

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.760
you know, I can be doing interviews

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.320
and doing these videos and writing articles

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.360
and appearing on people's podcasts

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.880
and it really feels like you can kind of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.080
carry the thing on your back

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.600
but I couldn't really 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.640
This is the first time really

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.600
that I've ever done this channel

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.720
that I just felt like I didn't have

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.280
the energy that I needed

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.160
to push us to where we needed to be

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.480
and that was difficult for me

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480
to be honest, especially

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.680
because

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.960
it felt like we were quite close to winning at times

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.840
but I think if I'm honest

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.920
we were probably never that close yet

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.120
and it's probably partially wishful thinking for me

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.160
anyway because when you're working so so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.640
so hard you just wanna get there, right?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.440
You wanna get there, you wanna reach the end

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600
you wanna win and have it won and kind of go away

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.120
go on holiday for like a year

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.560
but the truth is, it was never gonna be that easy

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.960
we've made unbelievable, amazing

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.760
amazing strides this year to win the public

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.120
but what we've seen is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760
it's not enough just to win the public

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840
you do need to figure out

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840
how to win over the politicians

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480
how to win over, you know

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.720
the media to some degree and this intellectual class

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.840
how do we break in to that sort of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880
how do we break in with the posh people, basically

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.440
and I think the truth is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.680
we were never gonna quite make it this year

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.360
which is a shame, but the truth is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.920
it's exactly what I predicted

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.840
you know, if you go and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.640
if you go and look at the videos that we did

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.800
just before the election

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.760
this is exactly what I said would happen

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.560
it's exactly what I said Labour would do

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.200
there's not a single thing that's happened

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.840
that surprised me. I didn't expect Labour to come

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.920
over, and they haven't

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.280
I expected Labour to be unpopular and they have

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000
I expected Labour to change leader

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.240
and it looks like they will

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.440
a new leader will come in

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560
it's new opportunity but if I'm totally honest

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.960
I don't think we'll get them either

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.280
but we are in a much much

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.840
much stronger position than we were one year ago

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.640
two years ago three years ago

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.200
the size of this movement is huge now so

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.960
I'm gonna keep fighting.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.680
So that was kind of where I was

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.640
when I came back and did the videos

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840
I felt that my energy was kind of going

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.520
which is a shame

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.920
because I'd only been back a month,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.200
month and a half and I always feel with these videos

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.160
I try my best to do them without a script

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.720
but it's hard when I'm tired

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.440
and I feel like when you go without a script

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.600
what really drives the videos

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.640
is your understanding and your passion and your energy

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.080
and it's sometimes difficult to combine those things

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.200
cause you wanna

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.960
keep that shape and structure and clarity

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.000
you get from understanding

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.120
but also allow that sort of passion to come through

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.520
and what I felt really during this season was

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.160
the energy was kind of going

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.040
and then we saw this like, massive

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.320
massive rise in the media salience of immigrant

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.640
refugee stuff, far right stuff

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.880
and that was really difficult for me

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.520
to be honest because

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.320
you know

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.200
I've always had this idea that I'm an economist

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.520
and I talk about the economy

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.960
and our current economic situation is not working

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.360
or not gonna work for 80, 90% of people

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.760
so we can really rally and unite the public on this

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.600
and a big part of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.160
sort of, the philosophy of this channel

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240
and my philosophy

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.760
is basically about uniting the public

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.320
and as this anti immigrant rhetoric really went up

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.760
and up and up

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.200
and up and up what I probably felt most personally

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.400
was just the division

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.120
basically, the division in the country

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.080
the division in the public, and for me it was difficult

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.920
you know, I know people think I'm a communist

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
I don't come from a political background

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.760
I come from a very working class, poor background

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.680
but then I've been to fancy universities

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.040
and I've worked fancy jobs

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.400
so now in many ways

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.240
I'm in a more sort of middle class space

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.800
and what I felt with this anti immigrant thing

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.720
reminded me a lot of how I felt with the Brexit thing

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.040
which was

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.240
I saw the sort of class divisions in this society

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.440
really being sort of torn at the seams

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.760
and it kind of felt like this division

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.360
between the world that I came from

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.760
and the world that I'm in now

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.600
and it's hard really, it's hard

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.720
it's sort of

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.200
it breaks my heart in a way to see so much division

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.400
and I worry. I worry that if

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.040
we don't do anything about this

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080
we can end up kind of

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.960
going the way that America has gone

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.360
where basically the country is like split into two

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.800
and everybody with the red hat

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.320
hates everyone with the blue hat

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.960
and everyone with the blue hat

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.720
hates everyone with the red hat

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.120
and I don't want it to go that way

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.600
I don't want it to go that way

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.920
so I decided to speak a little bit more about

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.560
the protest and the migrant stuff

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.800
which is not something I'm super

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.640
super comfortable speaking about

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.200
but it felt like something I had to do

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.880
and I did my best to speak about it in a way that

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.360
is compassionate and understand what's happening

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.920
and I hope I said the right things

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.080
I do my best

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.680
but we've got to the end of the season now

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.960
I've been pushing it if I'm honest

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.560
trying to sort of push myself to keep going

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.880
because I was only away last 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.960
in May, June

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.800
and I felt bad to take another break

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but I could feel that exhaustion coming

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.680
and when I get to the end of a season

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.720
I kind of

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.600
I kind of feel the same at the end of every season

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.160
which is this sense of

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.320
having really worked a lot

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.040
I put a lot of effort

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.120
into the this channel and these videos

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.160
and each season we achieve more

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.200
and each season we achieve more and

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.160
this year in particular

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.760
I think it's amazing what we've achieved

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.640
and you put so much work in

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.880
and you get to the end

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.160
and you realize that we still haven't won

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.040
and we're not even winning

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.840
and it's hard I think, I find that hard

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.640
but what I wanna say is, we are getting there

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.920
we are moving forward

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.800
the channel is like so

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.920
so much louder and bigger than it was

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.840
when I started this channel 5 years ago

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.520
I mean when I started 5 years ago

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.920
with my mate Simran

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.400
I never

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.480
ever would have imagined we could be what we are now

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.560
which is genuinely, legitimately

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.200
I think a major political player in this country

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.040
that's what we are and that growth is thanks to you

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.880
This channel is is ultimately a political experiment

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.240
which is to see whether

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.640
an almost unfunded YouTube channel can compete

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.240
with the major newspapers

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.080
and political broadcasters

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.720
TV channels, radio channels

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.320
on the basis of word of mouth from the public

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.880
just by being honest, being clear

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.320
being knowledgeable

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.600
and explaining what's happening to the public

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.400
and we're doing it, we're doing it

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.120
we're one of the major political players in the country

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.800
and I'll keep doing it, if we keep growing

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.000
we'll still be there

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.760
there's big opportunities next year

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.000
and I'll be back, I'll do my best to take ‘em

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.160
I wanna thank Jack, cameraman

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.240
Jack does great work

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.840
These videos are a lot tighter

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.200
when they go out than when I do them

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.840
and that's thanks to Jack's work

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.520
I never check his work

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.640
cause I have a implicit trust in him

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.160
he's doing a great job.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.360
I wanna thank Oscar

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.080
he's the only employee on this channel

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.360
and he has asked me

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.720
he basically runs runs all the

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.840
all the background stuff, all the organizational stuff

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.520
and he has asked me in particular

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.840
in typically selfless Oscar fashion

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640
to publicise

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.880
the merch that he's worked hard to get made

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.800
these tax wealth not work t shirts

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.520
I think there's more, we've got stickers

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.280
hoodies, tote bags...

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.440
Oscar's doing fantastic work

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.120
We'll put a comment in the link

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.280
a comment in the links...

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.400
a link in the comments for people who want to buy merch

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.920
I wanna say a very special

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.400
thank you to the patreon supporters

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.120
it's the patron supporters that pay Jack, that pay Oscar

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.600
we have never ever put any adverts in these videos

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.880
and the reason we're able to do that

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.320
is because of the Patreon supporters

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.400
it all works because of you

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.040
but more than anything like

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.720
it means a lot to me to see that

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.560
ordinary people are willing

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.480
to pay to support something they don't

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.800
get anything back for it

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.200
they pay because they care about this project

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.520
like I do, and when times are tough

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.680
it makes me feel like I'm not doing it alone

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.560
so yeah massive thanks to Jack, to Oscar 

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.680
to all the patreon supporters

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.840
really appreciate that

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.720
I've got a long list of thanks here

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.080
I wanna thank other people who do this work

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.680
Gabriel Zucman doing amazing work in France

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.240
all the great guys at Patriotic Millionaires UK

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.920
especially Rebecca Gowland

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.120
fantastic work they do over there

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.400
I want to thank Zack Polanski for the massive work

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.560
he's done publicising wealth taxes

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600
whether you like him or not

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.360
you know, I don't agree with him on everything

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.000
this guy has been doing so much work

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.280
publicising wealth taxes

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.240
we have to thank him. So many interviews

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.480
you gotta respect that

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.960
I've got a long list here of all the other creators

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.520
who I wanna thank. When I went away in May

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.080
I did a call out to people, to make art

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.840
to make, especially to make videos and there's so many

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm gonna forget some. Jimmy the Giant as always

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.520
big friend of the channel

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440
working his tits off doing great work

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.120

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.160
good lad, Forest Jar on Instagram

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.200
I think Forest Jar’s videos are really

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.640
really, really good work

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.280
go check them out

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.960

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.520
check out her channel. Barry's Economics

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.040
you gotta mention Barry's Economics

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.880
Barry's Economics, fantastic

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.480
I think he's nearly 10,000 subs

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.760
go check him out. Louisa Munch Critical Theory

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.560
these last two, Barry's Economics and Louisa Munch

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.280
I wanna give them a special mention

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.320
because I think the two of these made their channels

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.880
basically in response to the call out I did in May

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.440
saying I wanna see more people doing like, creating

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.400
So that means a lot to me

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.280
it's hard making a channel

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.720
you do a lot of work for not a lot of money

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.360
for basically no money for a lot of time

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.120
and I know how much work it is because I do it

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.080
so I really do appreciate you guys who

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.240
who are doing the work

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.680
Barry's Economics and Louisa Munch Critical Theory

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.440
the guys at Novara, Unlearning Economics

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.680
Punters Politics in Australia

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.720
Chloe Swarbrick in New Zealand

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.480
Ha-Joon Chang, doesn't have a channel

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.680
but I want him to make an Instagram about food

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.640
come on Ha-Joon Chang, you'll be really popular

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.320
I really appreciate other people doing it

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.680
I always feel guilty going on holiday

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.960
because I feel like I carry a lot of this movement

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.680
but I see more and more people making great videos

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.920
and it makes me feel like I can take breaks

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.840
which I need and I really appreciate that.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.000
All of the other creatives who've,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.920
people who sent us music, paintings

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.240
Jordan Stevens of Rizzle Kicks

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.680
putting us on the album

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.240
all of the grime artists who've been reaching out to us

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.320
Bashy, Toddla T everyone

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.560
the people who've been making t shirts, posters

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.480
stickers

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.280
it means a lot to me

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.640
this season's been a difficult one for me

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.200
I've worked so hard this year

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.560
and I've really exhausted myself

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.280
it's difficult doing creative work

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.920
when you feel exhausted I think the biggest

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.480
challenge about this particular part of the season is

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.680
in previous seasons

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.040
I've been very much focused on doing the creative work

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.080
doing the videos, doing the interviews

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.680
but this last season

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.400
I've been doing tons of work behind the scenes

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.960
which is trying to talk to think tanks

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.360
trying to talk to politicians

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.440
trying like, set stuff up

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.720
trying like, find ways to actually break into politics

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.200
and I hate it, I'm so bad at that

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.240
at that work

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.920
and it's so much easier to just be making the videos

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.360
trying to make amazing videos

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.360
and I'm not great at sort of multitasking

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.080
but we have to do it, we have to figure out ways this

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.800
This channel was

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.520
never about just making me famous on YouTube

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.120
supposed to be about changing policy

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.520
I'll keep doing that and

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.080
I wanna thank everyone who

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.040
who watches the videos who shares the videos

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.840
I really

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840
really appreciate it. There's a

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.320
I live in East London and there's a

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.360
there's a famous mural down the street from me

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.680
called Cable Street Mural

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.160
which is, it's a mural from the

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.840
I guess it was maybe the 30s, back when

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.000
like serious fascism was on the rise

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.760
and Nazism was on the rise in Europe

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.760
and there was a big like, fascist Nazi movement here in

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.920
London and in the UK and there was a march

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.520
the fascist march in London

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.360
and the locals in east London came out

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.600
and they didn't accept it

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.440
there was a massive fight

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.920
there's a big mural down the street

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.000
which is nice if you're ever in London

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.880
go check it out. And I go

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.480
I cycle past it all the time and quite often

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.280
I'll stop and just have a little look

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.960
and I stopped the other day

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.360
and I was standing by this mural

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.560
and I was looking at this mural

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.760
and just as I was looking

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.320
The sun was going down, painting the scene, and

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.840
just as I was looking at it

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.120
I saw that somebody had put a sticker

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.640
right on the railing at the bottom

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.520
right in the middle

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.120
a big tax wealh not work sticker

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.760
and when I see stuff like that it makes me think

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.640
that all the hard work is worth it

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.040
So that's it, I've got to go

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.280
I'll be already in Italy by the time this comes out

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.040
we've got a lot going on

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.080
some stuff I'm not allowed to speak about yet

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.920
cause it's not public

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.160
we're trying to do some really exciting stuff

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.080
so many offers coming in

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.000
we're trying to do some good stuff, tour in Italy

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.360
which is happening now. You'd have probably missed it

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.240
by the time this comes out

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.120
but we'll put the dates out on another short. Australia and

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.880
New Zealand tour coming in February

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.120
March

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.000
I think there's still tickets available

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.160
go and check that out

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.640
I'm really looking forward to going down under

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.000
I'm not quite sure how long we'll be down for

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.760
but I think we'll be at least a few months

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.880
we'll probably do some specials

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.600
in particular around the budget

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.640
because the budget's coming out in November

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.960
Government's gonna raise taxes

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.320
not on the rich

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.080
on workers

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.280
and people are gonna try to blame me for that

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.160
so we'll make some videos to make it very

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.680
very very

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.360
very clear that we are campaigning to raise taxes

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.520
on the very rich, not on working people

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.160
we'll probably have to do a special or two around the budget

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.400
maybe something end of the year

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.640
we'd love to go and meet Gabriel Zukman in France

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.880
Jack's been practicing his French especially

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.200
we don't know if we’ll manage to figure that out

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.760
but I'll be back

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.120
and in the meantime, keep watching the videos

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.240
keep making stuff, keep creating

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.640
keep talking about it

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.800
the message is simple

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.720
living standards are falling

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.160
because of growing wealth inequality

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.720
if you don't fix wealth inequality

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.160
if you don't fix the tax system

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.760
living standards will fall further

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.600
tax wealth not work

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.680
keep fighting, keep talking about it

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.280
I know it's a long fight

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.080
and sometimes it can be dispiriting

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.480
but I promise you this, we will win in the end

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.320
if we didn't win yet

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.720
it isn't the end

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.240
good luck.
