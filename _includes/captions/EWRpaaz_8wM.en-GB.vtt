00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.560
okay today we are going to talk about what I&nbsp;
think is one of the most important economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.480
changes of the last twenty-thirty years 
I'm very&nbsp;confident it's going to continue and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.680
dominate the economy for the next 20 years&nbsp;
if you want to understand what's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.880
happen in our economy you need to understand&nbsp;
this and it is the death of the middle class

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.320
okay so what do I mean when I say the death of&nbsp;
the middle class well the first thing is we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.920
to define what we mean by the middle class this&nbsp;
is a term that different people mean differently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.320
for the purpose of this video when I talk about&nbsp;
the middle class what I mean is people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.960
not rich but have some ownership of wealth so&nbsp;
in this country it basically means anyone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.120
owns their own property essentially so the UK has&nbsp;
a reputation for being a very unequal country but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.480
in reality if we compare it to all of the countries&nbsp;
across the world and also what the UK was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.040
for most of its history, it is actually a relatively&nbsp;
equal country and what I mean when I say that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.520
this country still has today a relatively broad&nbsp;
property owning middle class what that means is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.480
most people own the property that they live in&nbsp;
which means they do have some level of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.080
even if they're not super rich so let's talk a little&nbsp;
bit about the wealth distribution first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.720
in this country property residential property&nbsp;
is still quite broadly owned a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.800
own their own property once we start looking&nbsp;
at commercial property, financial wealth, debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.800
then we start seeing almost all of that world is&nbsp;
owned by richer people and they've increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.840
the very rich but residential property has&nbsp;some 
level of broad ownership so what that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.880
is we do have a broad property owning middle&nbsp;
class and that is true in the US and it's true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.640
in Australia, in Japan and most of Western Europe&nbsp;
there is a broad property owning middle class now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.880
what you need to understand is that is not really&nbsp;
normal either internationally or across history&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.360
so if you go to look at most of Latin America&nbsp;
or most of Africa or many places in Asia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.880
what you have is very unequal countries where&nbsp;
most people do not own much wealth at all you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.680
have a very large poor group and a small&nbsp;
very rich group and you do not have this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.600
broad property owning middle class like we have&nbsp;
here that's also true if you look throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.320
history right so before the second world wars&nbsp;
in the early 20th century in the 19th century&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.400
in the industrial revolution what you had in&nbsp;
this country was different to what you have now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.520
so at this point in time most people own or&nbsp;
their family owns the property they live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.600
it's decreasing over time but still most do&nbsp;
whereas if you were to look in the *1800s*&nbsp;

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.000
the vast majority of people here in London the vast&nbsp;
majority were renting very few people own their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.320
own home and there was not broad wealth ownership&nbsp;
so this broad property owned middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.560
you need to understand that even though it has&nbsp;
been normal for the last 50-60 years it is not normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.400
either across the world or throughout the&nbsp;
history of capitalism and if anything the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.200
last 70 years have been very special historically&nbsp;
in the sense that we have had this broad property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.600
owning middle class here, in the US, in Australia&nbsp;
and in Europe &amp; I think one big thing that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.080
dominated the economy over the last 20 years and&nbsp;
will definitely dominate it going forward is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.240
that middle class is slowly dying and what I mean&nbsp;
by that is the middle class is losing their assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.560
and that is happening in two ways, one the direct&nbsp;
loss of the assets themselves so in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.280
asset ownership by non-rich people is almost&nbsp;
always in the form of property if you look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.840
younger people their rate of property ownership is&nbsp;
collapsing so the number one way which the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.960
class dies loses their assets is direct loss of&nbsp;
property and the second way is increased debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.680
which means ordinary people have to go deeper into&nbsp;
debt to fund their lifestyles but increasingly if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.640
you want to own a property the only way to do&nbsp;
that is to take out enormous amounts of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.600
now this in my opinion is has really dominated&nbsp;
the economy especially since 2008 and my big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.480
sort of penny drop moment when I realised what was&nbsp;
happening with the economy was when I was a trader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.880
and I was trying to deal with the question of 'why&nbsp;
is it that people can't spend much money?' this has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.200
been the dominant economic narrative since 2008&nbsp;
and when I looked into the situation of ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.600
families and also of governments what I saw was&nbsp;
ordinary families were losing their wealth over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.320
you can see this in the form of decreased&nbsp;property 
ownership rates and also governments were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560
losing their wealth you could see this in the form&nbsp;
of governments falling deeper and deeper into debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.320
so that has created a situation where we have&nbsp;
economic weakness because families and governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.520
can't spend because they're losing their wealth
over time now when we consider this loss of wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.960
of the middle class in many ways what we are&nbsp;
seeing is the mirror image of something which I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.200
have spoken about a lot already on this channel&nbsp;
which is the rapid growth and snowballing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.640
wealth of the very rich now when you consider&nbsp;
the wealth distribution you need to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.720
we have this property owning middle class all the&nbsp;
know people that in many cases own their own homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.000
but when it comes to the broader commercial&nbsp;
infrastructure of our economies the factories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.480
the skyscrapers, the office&nbsp;buildings, 
food production, energy production&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.560
all of this commercial infrastructure is largely&nbsp;
owned by the rich and that means that every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.360
month every single year ordinary people have to&nbsp;
spend a lot of money which goes to the rich in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.720
order to get things like food, energy, transport,&nbsp;
the basic essentials of life or even housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.600
if you don't own your own home and this creates&nbsp;
enormous flows of wealth to the rich every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.800
the flows of wealth are so enormous that&nbsp;
rich people can't spend them, Rishi Sunak as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.800
I've said many times on the channel gets a&nbsp;
passive income of 20-30 million pounds a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.680
they can't spend that money so&nbsp;
they use that money to buy assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.400
and when you have a growing economy this isn't&nbsp;
necessarily a bad thing you're creating all&nbsp;of&nbsp;

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.200
this new economic wealth, these new assets,&nbsp;
new factories, new office blocks and the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.200
will own those new assets when it becomes a&nbsp;
really big problem is when that growth slows down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.480
so when economies stop growing you are still&nbsp;
having to pay all of that money to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.000
every year the rich are still receiving all that&nbsp;
money every year what do they do with that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.920
if they can't buy new assets because there are&nbsp;
not good investment opportunities they will still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.200
receive that money and what they start to do is&nbsp;
they use that money to buy your assets and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.200
what's really interesting is the things that&nbsp;
the rich people do with those money with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.360
money often appears good from the perspective&nbsp;
of the middle class so when the rich get that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.880
money and they're not investing they either&nbsp;
buy your assets or they lend you that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.360
from the perspective of a middle class person what&nbsp;
you see is the rich want to buy my house, my house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.520
price is going up, the rich want to lend me money&nbsp;
I have increased availability of mortgages and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.600
both of those things seem good right you are an&nbsp;
ordinary family your house price is going up great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.320
you can get more access to mortgages great&nbsp;
these are good things but if we think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.720
what it is actually doing in terms of flows&nbsp;
of wealth that is rich people buying houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.840
from more middle class families and often this&nbsp;
happens generationally rich people take the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.680
money, they give it to their kids, their kids have&nbsp;
a large amount of money, they go out and they buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.200
the houses that maybe your kids would have bought&nbsp;
and instead of your house going to your kids or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.680
another kid from an ordinary middle class family&nbsp;
ends up going to rich people when they lend money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.640
what that means is it might seem good for you&nbsp;
if you can get a mortgage but if the rich are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.120
lending more then that means everybody can get a&nbsp;
big mortgage and that means you are competing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.720
people who can get big mortgages and what that&nbsp;
means is it becomes impossible for ordinary middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:24.880
class people to buy property without taking a&nbsp;
massive mortgage essentially from the rich so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.720
create a situation where on the one hand middle&nbsp;
class families are selling their properties to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.280
rich and on the other hand if they are actually&nbsp;
able to keep property the only way to do it is by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.800
taking a massive debt from the rich so you have&nbsp;
two sides of the same coin here right massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.400
wealth accumulation from the rich is mirrored by&nbsp;
loss of assets for the middle class and increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.640
of debt for the middle class and exactly&nbsp;
the same thing is happening for governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.720
governments are losing their assets governments&nbsp;
are going into debt and you can see how this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.080
it's impossible for the rich to accumulate&nbsp;
assets in a low growth economy without these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.120
things happening because the assets have to come&nbsp;
from somewhere and what you see is loss of assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.120
for middle class, loss of assets for government,&nbsp;
growth of debt for the middle class, growth of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.040
debt for the government it's important to realise&nbsp;
that when the rich lend poor people money to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.200
assets essentially what's happening is the rich&nbsp;
are buying the assets through the poor now if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.280
lend you half a million pounds and use that half&nbsp;
million pounds to buy a house you still have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.520
pay me interest every year and it's very similar&nbsp;
to paying rent so the lending really is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.960
the flip side of the rich buying the asset it's&nbsp;
another way for the rich to buy the assets so in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.360
both cases the rich are gaining assets the middle&nbsp;
class are losing those assets and over time we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.920
lose that property owning middle class and we also&nbsp;
lose that property owning and stable government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.040
once this starts going it is essentially&nbsp;
inevitable it will continue right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.960
once the middle class starts&nbsp;
to lose their assets then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.080
there are more people who don't own property and&nbsp;
have to rent once they start to fall heavily into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.840
debt then they have to pay large amounts of&nbsp;
interest every year this means bigger flows of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.160
money from the middle class to the rich which&nbsp;
the rich can then use to buy the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.000
assets which means it starts a spiral which&nbsp;
builds up momentum over time and this is why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.720
it is pretty much inevitable that the middle&nbsp;
class will significantly lose their assets over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.560
the next 20 30 40 years and of all my economic&nbsp;
predictions I think this is the one that I'm most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.360
confident about that we will lose that property&nbsp;
owning middle class over the next 30-40 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.560
um so what does that mean what does that&nbsp;
mean well fortunately if we want to know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.280
economies without property owning middle classes&nbsp;
look like it's really easy to see that because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.040
we the world is full of them you can go to Brazil&nbsp;
you can go to South Africa you can go to Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.840
you can go to India and you can see what economies&nbsp;
look like when you do not have a property owning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.880
middle class so for the last 70 years we have had&nbsp;
property owning middle class in Europe in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.400
and it has led to a situation where we have had&nbsp;
broadly high standard of living not for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.640
there has always been poverty but it has been&nbsp;
unusual if we compare to most of history in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.840
percentage of people who live decent quality lives&nbsp;
if you look at countries without those property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:23.200
middle classes what do they look like? they look 
like&nbsp;small super wealthy elites and very very large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.400
essentially very poor people that very often&nbsp;
they're forced to live in very squalid housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.360
on the outskirts of cities they work for very&nbsp;
low wages and that is because when you lose your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.600
property owning middle class what you also&nbsp;
lose is your customer base the basis of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.640
wealth of Western economies in the last 70 years&nbsp;
is you have a big middle class you have a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.840
customers and what that means is even if you are&nbsp;
not middle class even if you are poor you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.800
a lot of customers so so you can get a decent&nbsp;
wage because there's a lot of people competing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.320
for your labour basically but once you lose that&nbsp;
middle class then you move to a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.280
workers are also significantly disadvantaged and&nbsp;
I think it's really interesting to go and sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.880
of look at cities like Johannesburg or Sao Paulo&nbsp;
Mumbai and what you see is because there's so few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.000
customers the poor are then forced to cluster&nbsp;
into the big cities because it's the only way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.280
to get work because that's where the rich people&nbsp;
are essentially and that's the only place you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.280
get your money from and I think it's interesting&nbsp;
that we're kind of seeing slowly slowly at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.560
the same thing happening here in London which&nbsp;
is London is significantly increasing in size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.720
is seeing an influx of poor people from&nbsp;
within the country from without the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.120
they're trying to get accommodation in the big&nbsp;
city because it's the only place where they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.680
get a decent job and it's kind of leading to&nbsp;
a slumification of the outskirts of the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.720
you know I grew up in ilford which is one of&nbsp;
the cheapest places to live in London you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.280
seen a massive increase in density you've seen a&nbsp;
massive decrease in the average quality of housing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.960
and essentially it's becoming slum and this is&nbsp;
what what happens when you lose your middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.520
if you don't have a middle class society you&nbsp;
have a rich and poor society and if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.360
have a middle class society you don't need middle&nbsp;
class housing what you need is rich housing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.160
poor housing and increasingly that is what we will&nbsp;
see so it will lead to a situation of very small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.960
wealthy elite and basically really really broad&nbsp;
poverty and um I don't want that to happen that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.720
why I made this channel um and it will happen, it&nbsp;
will happen for the simple reason that if you take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.960
two groups of people a large middle class and and&nbsp;
a small rich elite and you constantly pump wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.040
from the middle class to the super rich elite&nbsp;
and you don't pump anything back in the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.200
direction it is inevitable that over time this&nbsp;
group will lose their wealth you know if I take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.120
if I take two buckets of water and I constantly&nbsp;
pour water from one to the other eventually it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.840
will run out of water and this will this will&nbsp;
inevitably happen and you can easily see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.640
when you look at the flows of wealth between&nbsp;
the middle class and the rich, the middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.280
will eventually disappear and we can see what&nbsp;
that looks like you know it's go and look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.080
what countries are like without middle class&nbsp;
go and look read up on the history of the UK&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.280
or whatever country you're in what it looked like&nbsp;
in the early 20th century and 19th century before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.440
we had a broad property owning middle class&nbsp;
and you'll see is is a is a place of broad poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.000
and very low living conditions and we can see it&nbsp;
happening in front of our eyes we can see poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.440
growing we can see living standards falling and&nbsp;
that is inevitably what will happen if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.800
growing inequality slowly dying middle class&nbsp;
in a situation of no economic growth and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.080
only way to fix that is the pump wealth back in&nbsp;
the other direction and um we've called to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.960
many times on this channel we need high tax&nbsp;
on rich people it's the only way to support the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.600
middle class if your wealth is being pumped out of&nbsp;
your communities out of your families towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.640
very rich nothing is pumped back eventually we'll have&nbsp;
nothing left so please support us in campaigning &nbsp;

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.240
for higher tax on the rich, because if we don't&nbsp;
do it, it will mean poverty for the rest of us and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.880
um yeah it's important so uh yeah tax the rich 
more&nbsp;&amp; support the channel thanks for your time

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.840
money currently is flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.920
government with big piles of debt and the&nbsp;
rich with big piles of money, there's 1 other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.800
thing they can do with that mass amount&nbsp;
of income they can buy your mum's house
