00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay, welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.760
Today, we are going to teach you how

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.120
to be the best trader in the world.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.560
Okay, so this is one of the most commonly

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.000
asked questions on the channel, which is "Gary,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.240
the world's going to ****, we need you to help us.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480
Please, please, please, can you teach us

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.120
how to trade?" And generally, I've avoided

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.840
the question for a couple of reasons.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
One, because I think trading is very

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.880
dangerous and probably best avoided for ordinary

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.520
people who are not professionals.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.920
And secondly, because this channel is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.000
about trying to explain how and why the economy

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.840
is collapsing and to teach you what you can

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.560
do to stop your economy from collapsing.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.040
And I think that trading, whilst it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.320
can make money for the individual, is

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
not going to solve this societal problem.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.000
So I have generally avoided it, but if you have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
been following this channel for a while, you will

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.840
know that discussing whether or not I am the best

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.560
trader in the world is a very popular pastime for

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.480
the British media, both online and in print.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.360
I won't comment on that, I'll leave that for

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.920
the trading Ballon d'Or this year to decide

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
who's the best trader in the world.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.680
But, I was Citibank's most profitable

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.200
trader in 2011, and I have made

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.640
an awful lot of money trading since.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.840
I've got an extremely good track record and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.600
in the last few months, and especially weeks,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.320
I've been getting really, really frustrated

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.000
by the differences, basically, in the,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.800
the world of economic analysis within trading

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520
and in the world that I am in now, which is, I guess,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.560
you could call it activism or media or politics.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.040
Basically, trying to prevent

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440
economic collapse from happening.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.520
So I've become, been becoming super frustrated

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.720
by the kind of contrast, contradictions between

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.000
the world of trading and this world I'm in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.640
now, which I guess is the world of politics.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
And I thought I'd use that opportunity to finally

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.520
answer this question of how do you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.120
be the best trader in the world.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.320
Really use this as a bit of an opportunity to talk

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.160
about trading, because I kind of, love trading.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440
I think it is a beautiful discipline.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.400
I think it's really dangerous.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.520
It's something that... It taught me in a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.880
sense, everything I know about economics today.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.160
So I wanted to talk about it a little bit,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.600
educate you about it, and give you what you want in

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.240
a sense, because I keep getting asked it again and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.640
again, but I'm going to ask for something in return.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.400
So I'm going to teach you how to be the best trader in the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.680
world, and in return, I'm going to ask for two things.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.200
One, please be very, very careful

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.080
if you ever try to do this.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.320
It's phenomenally dangerous.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.440
And secondly, I want you to think a little

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.280
bit about what this means for the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.080
world we live in, for the country that you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.000
live in, for your society and your future.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.280
Because I'm going to explain a little bit

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.960
the way the world of economics works,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.240
in trading, in politics, and I think,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120
personally, it's phenomenally worrying.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.320
It's one of the reasons why I started this channel.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.920
So that's it.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920
I'm going to teach you how to trade, and in return, I want

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.440
you to think just a little bit about what it means for

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.000
your society and the future of you and your family.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.240
Okay, number one.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.040
What is trading?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.440
So there's lots of different kinds of trading.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.520
I was a professional trader for Citibank

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.400
from 2008 until 2014, and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.320
I am now somebody who trades on my laptop,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.080
using leverage essentially, essentially betting.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.640
There's a few different kinds of trading.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.320
I also wrote a book.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.360
This is the book that I wrote, The Trading Game.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.040
Still in the top 10, would you believe?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520
Seven, eight months later after it came out.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.120
And if you read this book, you'll see that there

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.800
are lots of different kinds of traders and there are a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400
few different kinds of ways to make money in trading.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.560
A lot of traders who work for big banks

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.040
tend to make money because they have

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.680
found clever ways to rip people off.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.840
But the kind of trading which I am

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.040
most interested in, and which I made my

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.560
money on is basically economic forecasting.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.800
So I'm going to talk about... a little bit about

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.240
this kind of trading, economic forecasting as trading.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.480
How does it work?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.440
So basically, I think the simplest way to

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.600
understand is imagine the weather forecast.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.520
So every morning when I wake up, I pull open

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.560
this laptop... not immediately when

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760
I wake up, but at some point in the morning,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.400
and I'll pull open my trading platform

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.600
and I'll look at all the different prices.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.680
And when I see that, it is very similar, I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.640
think, to when somebody who is not a trader

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.360
maybe looks at the weather forecast in the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.320
sense, I don't just see a set of prices.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.480
When the prices move, what I see is

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.520
changes in what traders are predicting

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.760
about what is going to happen in the future.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.040
And you can bet on that basically.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.760
So trading is betting.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.960
It is gambling.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.440
So I think the cleanest example is, let's say

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.240
you looked at the weather forecast and it said

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.120
that tomorrow there's a 50% chance of rain.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.720
And you, for whatever reason, because you're the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.760
world's best meteorologist, I don't know, know that

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.440
actually there is, it's almost certainly going to rain.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.040
It's like 95% likely to rain.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.080
You can bet on this.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.480
And if it's 50%, I've chosen 50% on

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.480
purpose, 50% is like exactly 50/50.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.440
That means that the market will, because both sides are

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.920
considered equally likely, you should be standing to win

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.480
exactly as much as you stand to lose if you're wrong.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.720
You can think, if you prefer, you

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.480
can think of it in terms of sports, in terms

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.080
of football, or in terms of betting.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.040
So at the moment, the market thinks that there is a

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.920
50% chance that Reform will win the next election.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.400
So I can bet on that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.160
and I say, no, they will definitely win.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.560
And if I'm right, I will double my money.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.400
I put Â£100 down.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.480
Because it's 50/50, the amount I

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.080
should win if I'm right is 100 pounds.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.800
The amount I should lose if

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.880
I'm wrong is also 100 pounds.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.200
And this is, this is what you do, basically.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.320
It's very, very simple, trading

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.840
as economic forecasting, which is

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.640
you are looking at what the market thinks,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.520
50%, and you're basically saying, "I think it's

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.200
going to be higher. I think it's going to be lower."

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.760
Let's shift these numbers about a little bit, right?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.360
Let's say the market thinks tomorrow

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.040
that there is only a 10% chance of rain.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.920
So on 50/50 it was simple, right?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.960
Because it's 50/50, exactly equal, the

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.000
amount you stand to win should be exactly

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.240
the same as the amount you stand to lose.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.960
But now the market says, "Oh, it's only a 10%

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.600
chance of rain." That's like phenomenally unlikely.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.160
Well, it's, let's say it's pretty unlikely.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.440
But you still think it's almost certainly going to rain.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.120
Now because the market thinks the chance of rain

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.920
is nine times less than the chance of not rain,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.520
the amount that you stand to win should be nine

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.520
times more than the amount that you stand to lose.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.560
Because what, what you are saying...

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.920
the thing that you are saying is going to happen,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.000
everybody thinks, "Oh, that's never going to happen.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.360
It's phenomenally unlikely." You know?

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.200
So you're betting on Manchester United winning the

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200
league, or something even less likely, like the

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.120
Conservatives winning the next election, right?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.760
If you're going to bet on something phenomenally unlikely

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.280
like this, then the market will give you more.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.760
So if you bet Â£100 on it raining tomorrow when

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.400
the market says only 10%, or the Conservatives

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.960
winning the election, which is actually also

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.720
similar odds, about 10%, you should stand to

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.600
win nine times more than you stand to lose.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.000
So if you risk Â£100, the amount that

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.520
you should win is Â£900, nine times more.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.840
So trading really is basically

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.880
gambling, but you're gambling on economic things.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.080
So when I was a trader, I used to bet a lot

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.720
on... When I was a professional trader for

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.240
Citibank, I used to bet a lot on interest rates.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.360
And this, again is quite similar.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.040
So I can actually... I can pull it up now, actually.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.360
We can have a look.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.200
So at the moment the Bank of England

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.400
base rate in the UK is 4%, but we can bet

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.400
on what the base rate will be in the future.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.840
So I can bet on what the base rate will be at

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.040
the end of next year, and I can put it up now.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.880
And the financial markets think

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.320
that the base rate will be 3.45%.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.000
And you can bet on that, basically.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.200
And it works in this kind

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.280
of higher or lower kind of way.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.960
So if you, for some reason, knew that rates

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.560
were going to stay at 4%, you could basically bet

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.600
like a certain, like a number of pounds per

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.240
point that it's going to be higher than 3.45%.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.480
So I say, "Okay, it's going to be higher than

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.120
3.45." I know rates are going to stay at four.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:52.240
I bet Â£100 per .01% and I'll make Â£100 times 55, which

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.240
is the amount that I was right by, which is Â£5,500.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.040
And if rates go to zero, I lose much more.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.200
So, really, trading is just gambling it... Just

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.200
in the same way that you could bet on a football

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.600
match, if you bet on something really unlikely, like

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.040
Man United winning the league, you'll make

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.000
a lot of money.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.520
If you bet on something really likely, like

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.760
Liverpool winning the league, you'll make less money.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.800
Now, let me tell you why I like this.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.480
This kind of system of thinking about the economy

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.600
rewards you for a couple of things,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.640
which I think are good and are important.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.360
Number one, it rewards you in particular

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.520
for being right when everybody is wrong.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.880
So I was like a counter-trend trader, and I was

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.320
looking for things which everybody thought was unlikely.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.240
And my big trade, which made me

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.280
my big money when I was at Citibank,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.000
was essentially betting that interest rates would

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.360
stay low for a long time after the 2008 crisis.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.760
And I made that bet because I thought the economy

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.400
would be weak for a long time after that crisis.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.960
And I believed that because I could see that

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.240
ordinary people were struggling financially,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.320
whereas the rich were accumulating a lot of assets.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.720
And I knew that ordinary people are essentially,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.560
or were, it's becoming less true,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.960
ordinary people are the driver of the economy.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.040
So I bet on this thing in specifically 2011,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.760
when I was Citibank's most profitable trader

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.480
in the world, that the economy would

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.160
be really weak, that rates would stay zero.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.040
And the reason I made so much money on that was not

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.240
because that happened, but it was particularly because

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.040
at that time, at the beginning of 2011,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.320
nobody thought it was going to happen.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.720
So I'd correctly identified this thing, which

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.680
was that the economy's ******, ordinary families

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.600
are ******, the economy is going to be weak.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.840
And when I put that trade on at the beginning of 2011,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.680
that's, that was a few years after the Lehman crisis.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.040
Inflation was starting to rise,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.920
and people had been waiting for a long time

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.920
after Lehman crisis for the economy to recover.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.560
And everybody, well, the vast majority of economists

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.440
and traders thought the economy was going to recover.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.920
And the reason that I made so much money on that trade

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.680
was not because rates stayed at zero, but

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.640
because rates stayed at zero and everybody

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.160
thought that rates were going to go up.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.760
And I did a very similar thing

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.640
at the beginning of COVID.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.040
So, by the beginning of COVID, I'd

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.280
been looking at trading for a long time.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.920
So I'd really fallen into this style of looking at

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.640
trading, which is try to understand specifically

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.080
what it is that everybody is missing.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.280
So I had become, and still am very

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.480
interested in inequality and distribution.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.440
I think that in general, economists don't

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.120
look at or think about inequality or distribution.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.680
So basically, I developed one simple way to very

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.080
consistently make money in financial markets, which has

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.760
worked very well for me for a long time now, which is

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:10.600
super simple. Whenever anything big happens, understand

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.080
what that is going to do to inequality and distribution.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.360
Because most economists don't think very much,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.640
especially about inequality of

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.720
wealth and distribution of wealth.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.240
So at the beginning of COVID, I asked myself the

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.160
same question I always ask myself when anything

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.200
big happens, "What is this going to do to distribution?

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.320
What is this going to do to distribution of wealth?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.480
What is it going to do to the different groups

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.600
in society?" And I think... So the first video

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.960
I ever did on this channel was in June 2020.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.000
And if you go back and look at it, and I

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.600
think we'll put a link in the description, you will

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.120
see that that video is precisely going through that

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.800
line of consciousness, that line of thought,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.720
which is understanding, asking some questions

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.240
about, "What's happening in COVID economically?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.880
How is that going to affect distribution?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.400
How is that going to affect different groups?"

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.640
And it's so easy to make money when you do that

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.240
because it is a massive driver of the

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.960
economy, and economists never talk about it.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.600
And what I saw very quickly, and if you want

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.320
you can go back and see that video, I used to

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.400
talk about it loads on the channel, was that the

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.080
government would give a huge amount of money out.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.400
Government debt would increase.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.160
Ordinary people would use that money to pay their rent,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.840
their mortgages, their bills, their food.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.360
It would end up getting accumulated by the rich

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.040
people who own the assets that are involved in

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.800
providing those services, such as owning the

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.520
houses, owning the government debt, owning the

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.120
corporations, owning the natural resources.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.640
Money always flows to them when you spend

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.880
money, but what was interesting about COVID was,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.520
because luxury spending was banned, these rich

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.640
people weren't able to spend the money, and what

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.040
you saw was this enormous flood of money from

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.960
the government through the poor to the rich.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.120
And the way it was being generally portrayed

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.960
in the media at the time was, there was a lot

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.800
of focus on, like, furloughed workers, money

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.640
is... Or stimulus check if you're in the US.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.400
Money is going to the poor.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.160
Money is going to the poor.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.240
Money is going to the poor.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.680
But what was never really discussed was the fact

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.000
that the poor are spending that money because they're

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.120
not getting their wages, and it's ending up being

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.240
accumulated by rich people who can't spend it.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.520
And when we come out of COVID, what you will have is

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.600
rich people sitting on these enormous bank balances.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.160
And that was so, so, so easy to monetise, precisely

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.920
because of the same two reasons, which are the

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.160
same two things I always think about, which is,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.000
what's happening to inequality and distribution,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.520
because that's the main economic driver and

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.960
economists don't look at it, and what element of

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.960
that is not being recognised in the narrative?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.760
In 2008, I recognised that the narrative wasn't

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.960
recognising that ordinary people, middle-class people,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.160
poor people, were really struggling, and that meant

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.200
that the economy would be weak for a long time.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.440
But in COVID, what people didn't realise is that the

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.520
rich and the very rich were accumulating enormous

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.480
amounts of money, and that that would lead to an

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.840
inequality crisis, a cost of living crisis, an

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.480
inflation crisis, and most obviously, an asset

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.200
price, massive, massive asset price increase, crisis.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.760
So I bet enormously on the gold price going up.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.200
I bought a huge amount of gold right at the beginning

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.040
of COVID, and I also bought quite lot of stocks.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.440
And those have done very, very well.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.480
And it's just basically based on

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.520
understanding always the same thing, which is,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.520
economists don't look at inequality.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.720
Inequality is really, at this point,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.440
the main driver of big economic moves.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.840
So if you understand what's going to happen to

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.760
inequality, you can understand very easily

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.360
what's going to happen to the economy.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.120
So the lesson of this basically answers the

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.560
question in the title of this video, "How to be the

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.880
best trader in the world." All you really need to do

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.240
to be a very, very good trader from an economic analysis

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.840
perspective is understand specifically, "What is it that

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.800
is very important that is not being understood by the

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.840
majority of economists and traders?" Because if you bet

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.720
on something that's definitely going to happen, like, for

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.240
example, you know, betting on Liverpool or Manchester

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.240
City winning the league, or, you know, everybody

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.920
knows it's not going to rain tomorrow and you say, "It's

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.560
not going to rain tomorrow," you don't make any money.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.520
You make the money when you have correctly identified

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.720
something that everybody is wrong about.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.520
And you only need to identify one of these things if

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.760
people are consistently wrong about it.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.000
So all of the money I've ever made, and it's

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.800
at this point quite a lot, on trading,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.920
is based on one simple understanding.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.880
Economists do not recognise the macroeconomic

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.880
importance of growing wealth inequality.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.360
And whenever anything happens, I

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.040
look at the wealth distribution.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.560
What's going to happen?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.080
Because the economists are not looking at it, I will

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.400
be able to predict things that will happen, such as the

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.240
phenomenal weakness after 2008, or the inflation price...

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.960
the inflation crisis, cost of living crisis after COVID.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.040
They will not be predicted.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.120
I can predict them.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.360
That's how you make your money.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.320
To be the best trader in the world, you

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.960
simply need to identify something that is very

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.240
important that the economists have missed.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.720
So now I've spoken about that, I want to talk a little

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.280
bit abo- more about why I... I never talk about this on

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.800
the channel but it's true... why I kind of love trading.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.760
So there's this one element which is, it rewards you

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.120
for recognising things everybody else has missed.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.440
And I don't know if that's just part of

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.200
my personality, but I think it's, I think

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.040
it's very important for society, right?

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.680
Like, if there is something badly wrong

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.000
that nobody's noticed, that is the kind of

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.120
thing you want to incentivise people to reward.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.720
You know, if you're building a bridge, or let's

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.040
say you're building a rocket ship, and everybody

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.040
thinks it's going to fly but there's one thing in

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.800
there that's going to cause it to blow up, you want

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.960
to incentivise people to find that thing, right?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.280
So trading does this phenomenal thing of

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.880
really incentivising and rewarding people

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.360
for recognising when everybody is wrong on a thing.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.960
And I think there's a real beauty

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.600
to that and there's an importance to that.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.080
Because most of our methods of analysis

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.200
in society, say, be it in politics or in

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.680
the media or in academia, they don't really

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.880
incentivise or reward people who kind of fight

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.400
against or push back against the groupthink.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.120
And trading does this, and I think that that

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.280
is something that is really beautiful and

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.040
something that is really useful for society.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.320
Unfortunately, it's not really often used for the

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.280
good of society, which is something I'll get into later.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.760
But it does another thing as well, which

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.360
is it rewards you for kind of putting

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.080
your nuts on the line, on a thing.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.120
So you can do this.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.920
So when I say, as a trader, you only really

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.360
need to recognise one thing the economists are

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.000
missing, and you just bet on that one thing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.080
So as a trader, you can make as many bets as

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.840
you like, but you can choose what you're going to

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.800
bet a lot of money on, and you can choose what

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.400
you're going to bet a little bit of money on.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.880
So the kind of traders that really, really do

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.440
well, in my opinion, are the traders who... at

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.760
least this is definitely my side of trading, they

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.720
recognise the thing that they are really good at,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.480
the thing that they have a really good understanding

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.240
on, and they bet all of their money on that thing.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.560
And I think it's a really good way to recognise and

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.800
identify good people, to find people who are willing

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.080
to make outrageous predictions that everybody says are

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.160
wrong and bet enormous amounts of their own money on it.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.880
And I think this is

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.440
such an important element of trading.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.480
And I was talking to Jack

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.880
before we shot this about this.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.680
So there's a line from one of

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.960
my sort of trading mentors, which is, "Don't tell

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.600
me your opinion, tell me your position." And

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.080
what he means when he says this, so a position

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.240
is what traders call the thing or the group of

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.120
things that they have actually bet their money on.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.640
And there's this thing that happens when you're

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.280
a trader, which is you're a young trader and at

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.280
some point you're going to put your first big bet on.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.000
And you go into the office and you put your

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
big bet on and then you go home and then you sit

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
down, and if you are wrong in this bet, you're

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.280
going to... you personally are going to lose Â£100,000

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.160
It's your first big trade.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.240
It's your first big bet.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.960
You sit down, and this has happened to me and I think

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.880
it has probably happened to any professional trader.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:40.960
You think, "******, am I actually right on that thing?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.720
Because if I'm wrong on that thing, I'm going to lose

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.360
Â£100,000 and that's going to be ****." And then

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.400
you start thinking about that trade,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.880
that bet, that ultimately it is an opinion of yours,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.960
and you're going to start... you're going to really start

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.480
really thinking, "Is that trade actually right?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480
Am I actually right?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.360
Is that opinion actually right?" And you

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.680
might realise, "Uh, but what about this thing?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.400
I haven't looked at that

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.640
I haven't thought about that thing.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.080
What about this thing that that guy said?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.160
Could that be important?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.920
Could this be important?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.280
Maybe I need to research this thing." And

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.000
I, basically think once you've experienced

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.840
betting a huge amount of your personal money

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.160
on what is essentially just an opinion, you start to

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.360
fundamentally think about opinions in a different

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.600
way that you have never thought about before.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.560
You start to really, really sit and think,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.120
"Are my opinions actually right?" And this is what

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.800
my old trading mentor, in the book he's called, Billy,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.000
meant when he said, "I don't care about your opinion,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.440
I want to know your position." Which is basically

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.080
once you have been a trader and you have experienced

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.680
the concept of putting yourself at risk of facing

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.320
enormous personal loss if your opinions are wrong,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.040
you start to really, really think long and hard about

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.000
whether your opinions are right or wrong or not.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And you kind of start to not really care

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
about people expressing opinions who are

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.880
not willing to bet their own money on it.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.200
Because you kind of realise that at the end of

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.840
the day, opinions that people are not willing

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.240
to support with their own, like, financial loss

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.040
are often, like, kind of bull****, basically.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.440
And this is what I love about trading.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.600
It force you to not chat bull****, to

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.560
really, really interrogate yourself, to really,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.760
really ask yourself, "Am I actually right?

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.560
Is that the right answer?" To not just sort of

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.160
chat ****, whatever sort of **** works at the time.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.440
It forces you to ask yourself, like, "Which of my

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.880
opinions am I really, really, really confident on?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.040
Which ones am I really, really

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.880
willing to bet my own money on?

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.320
Which ones am I really willing to back myself

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.280
on?" And it also rewards you for

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.680
recognising when other people are wrong.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.440
And the last thing, which I love about it,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.120
is that it recognises the people who are right.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.680
So as I've said, I was a kind of a counter-trend

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.000
trader, which means I was always looking for

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
times and moments when the narrative

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.080
was wrong, when the consensus opinion was

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.680
wrong, when everybody was wrong about a thing.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.240
And when I put my big trade on in 2011,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.200
that the economy would never recover, that was

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.160
my first big, like, counter-consensus trade.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.960
And lots of people thought I was wrong.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.920
And, yeah, I love economics, obviously.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.120
And I hired a junior who was, like, fresh

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.720
out of Bocconi in Italy, economics graduate,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.480
and we would argue about economics all the time.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.080
And I would argue with a lot of richer,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.240
posher, better-connected people about the economy.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.080
And very often people would say that I was wrong

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.400
because I was taking these counter-trend positions.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.720
They would say, "No, you know, the

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.160
economy is, it's getting better.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.200
It's going to be fine.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.080
Things are going to be good.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.960
Things are getting better." And as a trader then,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.520
and to be honest, even still now, because I do still

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.200
trade now, when I'm in this kind of situation where

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.120
everybody's saying to me, "Again, oh, you're wrong.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.840
No, you're wrong.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.800
Things are going to be fine.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.240
Things aren't going to get worse." The trader

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.920
in me, like, really loves it. Because I know

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.960
that the more people say I'm wrong, and the more

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.040
people think I'm wrong, and the more people argue

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.720
I'm wrong, the more money I'm going to make.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.120
And there's something about my personality that

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.480
I really enjoy there, and it's this... In a way, it

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.600
kind of helps because I have always made money betting

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.680
on terrible things, and predicting terrible

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.200
things, and I know things are going to get worse.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.480
And as a trader, you have this thing, which is at least,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.760
at the end of the day, I'm going to be right, they're going to

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.280
be wrong, they're going to have to give me loads of money.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.400
And at the end of the day, everybody's going to look at

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.800
the numbers and they're going to see that I was right.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.800
And it doesn't stop the world from collapsing.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.560
It doesn't stop the world from being ****.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.160
But what it does do is it forces them to

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.240
recognise at the end of the day that you were right

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.200
and they were wrong, and that allows you to sort

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.680
of at least get a little bit of respect for the

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.040
fact that you correctly predicted this disaster.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.760
And this then brings me to the weaknesses of

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:25.120
trading, which is as much as you are able to be rewarded

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.760
and recognised for correctly identifying big problems in

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.240
society, you can't do anything as a trader to fix them.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.360
And this is one of the questions I get asked a lot

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.360
when I do interviews, which is people say to me, "Gary,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.320
do you think it was wrong that you bet on society

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.320
collapsing and you made so much money?" And

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.320
in a sense, that's kind of a funny question because

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.240
it kind of assumes that there was like an alternative.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.520
There not... So, there's not a phone

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.440
on the trading floor that you can go to and, you

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.960
know, ring up the prime minister or the president,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.080
and say, "Hey, listen, I'm Citibank's number

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.480
one trader, and I've recognised your economy is

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.200
going to collapse, and would you like to do

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.760
something about it?" That phone doesn't exist.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.880
What you can do if you want to fix the economy

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.960
is basically exactly what I have done, which

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.240
is, very, very shortly after becoming

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.160
Citibank's most profitable trader, in

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.080
2011, I started trying to quit the bank because

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.200
wanted to try and stop our society from collapsing.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:45.760
And what I find super interesting is, as a trader,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.160
because I had this very, very good long term track

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.440
record of being right, I was very well-esteemed and

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.160
very well-respected, and I would get any resources

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.960
that I want and I could talk to anybody that I want.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.480
And it was kind of generally recognised that, you

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.840
know, Gary is one of the best traders in the bank.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.800
So you have this thing in trading at a bank called

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.800
P&amp;L, profit and loss, and it's very visible.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.520
Spreadsheet goes round, everybody can

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.720
see everybody else's profit and loss, so

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.680
everybody knows who the best traders are.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.800
And because I was number one in 2011,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.200
I was like kind of a bit famous at Citibank

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.160
for being like... I was very young in 2011.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.680
I turned 25 at the end of the year.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.320
Everybody was sort of like, "This guy is like one

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.640
of the hot young traders." And I got paid a

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.920
lot of money and I got given a lot of recognition.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.640
And I... When I came out of trading,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.160
I was kind of a little bit naive.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.560
I kind of thought that, you know, if I can get paid

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.760
Â£2 million a year working for a bank, if I can be

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.960
one of the best traders in the world for one the

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.360
biggest banks in the world, surely government and,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.760
and the media and think tanks will want to listen to me.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.680
But the truth is,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.400
really they haven't listened so much.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.720
And I've been out in the world of

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.080
public-facing economics for... I actually quit Citibank

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.680
in 2014, is when I finally got out, and I've been

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.680
speaking very publicly since the beginning of 2020.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.960
And I've really struggled

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.640
to get people to listen, really.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.600
And this is the big frustration

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.000
I find with being somebody who was a trader and

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.680
is now in the world of trying to actually do

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.920
something about the economy, which is... When

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.800
you're a trader, when I was a trader, and I was a

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.960
counter-trend trader, people disagree with you a lot.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.800
And it's fantastic because you're going to make tons of

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.760
money, and at the end of the year, everybody's going to

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.480
say, "Gary was right." But now in this world of like

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.000
public-facing economics, that basically doesn't happen.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
So, my first video on this channel in

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.320
2020, I... You know, you should go back and

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.040
watch it because it's ******* very good, basically.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.120
It was June 2020, the beginning of COVID, when

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.200
everybody was still saying, "You know, we're going to

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.440
have a really massive economic recovery after COVID,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.640
pent-up demand, roaring 20s." And I correctly predicted

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.560
the cost of living crisis, the inflation crisis, the

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.680
austerity crisis, the... That there would be a massive

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.520
increase in asset prices, house prices.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.680
At the time, The Guardian was

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.360
predicting a house price collapse.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.840
Everybody was predicting a massive economic boom.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.080
But my predictions were super correct.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.400
And it's basically for the

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.960
same reason it's always been, because I

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.680
understand the importance of inequality.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.680
And as somebody who was a trader, you have this

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.080
instinct which is like, "Oh my God, I'm going to make so

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.240
much money." And, and I did make a load of money, but,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.400
you know, at the end of the year, everybody's going to

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.240
see that my predictions are right, everybody else's

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.400
predictions were wrong, and then maybe I'm going to be

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.560
able to get a little bit of recognition and maybe we're

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.760
going to be able to solve this massive economic crisis.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.680
But the truth is, it didn't work out that way.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.600
I made these phenomenal economic predictions

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.840
and I made a lot of excellent trades and I made a

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.800
lot of money, and the cost of living crisis happened

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.880
and the inequality crisis happened and the,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.680
the austerity crisis happened and is happening.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.240
Asset prices went through the roof.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.000
All of these things happened, and I

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.360
was kind of screaming to government

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.160
that we need to do something about it.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.120
And I got a little bit of coverage in the media.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.240
But this crazy thing happened where basically

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.240
nobody or almost nobody in the public sector cared.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.120
And I think this is the

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.000
point that I want to make with you.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.360
We've created an economy where people who are

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.120
very, very, very, very good at understanding the

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.560
economy will collapse can get paid millions of pounds

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.040
a year working for any bank in the City, in Canary

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.080
Wharf, in your country's financial district.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.440
But I have been out here speaking publicly about

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.920
these things now for very little money, usually

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.920
for free, and I have not been able to speak

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.320
to or advise any British government for free.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.680
And that is the thing which

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.320
you... I want you to understand.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.480
I could get paid millions of pounds a year

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.240
working for pretty much any bank in the world,

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.840
and I cannot advise the government for free.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.760
So why is that?

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.600
And I think the reason for that is primarily because

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.160
we have split economics into two worlds,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.200
where we view trading as like practical

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.760
economics, and we don't view it as proper

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.680
economics, which is kind of academic economics.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.840
And in this public policy world, government,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.720
academia, universities, think tanks, they

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.320
want a different kind of economist who

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.760
has gone through a more academic route,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.200
and they don't view trading as economic analysis.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.120
So we need to talk quickly about the

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.080
question, is trading economic analysis?

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.240
So I did my undergrad a long time ago now at

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.440
the London School of Economics, which is one of

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.360
the most famous and most prestigious economics

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.720
universities in the world, probably the most

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.040
famous economic specialist university in the world.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.760
It's very hard to get into.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.840
It's, you know, it's full of very, very rich people.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.240
And when I was there, I did maths and economics, and

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.120
I want you to understand a little bit about what is

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.040
happening in that space, which is when I was there, the

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.520
vast majority of the best students wanted to be traders.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.640
And it was very, very difficult to become a trader,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.040
but it was extraordinarily competitive, and most

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.720
of the best students were able to become traders.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.840
And that is probably true for most

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.000
economics universities across the world.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.480
Then when you get onto the trading floor, what you

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.600
find is tons of people absolutely obsessed with

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.520
being the best economist, doing the best economic

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.680
analysis, aggressively competing, working 100-hour

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.480
weeks, waking up at 5:00 AM to be the besteconomist.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.520
The best-paid 10,000 economists in the world

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.360
are all traders, every single one of them.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.520
But you are not going to hear their voices on

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.920
the news, and they are not going to be advising

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.000
your government, and they are not going to be in

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.960
the political parties that run your country.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.880
They're not working for your newspapers.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.120
You don't see them on TV.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.640
You don't see them on the internet.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.560
So what we have is this situation where

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.400
the vast majority of the best young

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.120
economists are desperately trying to become

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.920
traders, then the best resourced and the hardest

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.840
working economists are pretty much all traders.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.720
And yet you are watching a kind of, in a sense,

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.040
like a TV show about economics, which is

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.360
the media, the politicians, the central banks.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.040
And they're telling you they are the best economists

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.960
in the world, but they are not including any of

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.960
the best paid 10,000 economists in the world.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.800
It's a little bit like you are watching a

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.360
football game, and you are being told like, "This

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.280
is the Champions League final, the best football

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.640
game." And yet none of the 10,000 best paid

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.280
footballers in the world are playing in this game.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.280
Basically, you are being governed by and being

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.320
spoken to you by third division economists

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.200
pretending to be Premier League economists.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.000
And that is where we are, to be honest.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.800
And I was hesitant actually

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.600
about putting that line in the video, because

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.880
I think part of the reason maybe why I've found it

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.680
difficult to get influence in the world that

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.960
I'm in now, the world of politics and media and

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.240
academia, is because I say things like that that are

00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.080
not nice to hear for the economists in things like

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.360
government and politics and central bank.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.960
And you need to recognise... And the media,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.640
of course, you need to recognise these guys were

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.440
at uni with people like me, and they saw most of

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.120
their smartest friends go and get these jobs in

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.280
the banks and get paid much more than them.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.440
And they kind of don't like it when people

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.240
like me come out and say, "All right, guys.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.720
Now, I've made a ton of money, I'm going to tell

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.960
you how to do your jobs." And they don't like

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.960
it and then, and they don't listen to me.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.360
But then that raises the question, what do you do?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.720
What do you do?

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.080
If you are somebody who is very, very, very good

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.640
at being right on things and has identified

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.000
a problem, and you have a field out there like

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.800
trading, which is very, very good at aggressively

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.040
rewarding people who are right about things.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.560
And then you have another field out there, which is

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.160
politics, which kind of doesn't really care if you

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.240
have a track record about being right about things.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.360
What do you do?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.400
How do you actually fix your country?

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.160
it's so much easier to bet on things and

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.920
make money on things than have any actual influence.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.840
And this is basically what has been frustrating

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.920
me in the last couple of years, well,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.360
especially the last couple of months and weeks.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.400
And that is when you're a trader, if you are a very

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.840
good trader, it's very easy to make yourself visible

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.240
and it's very easy to find the best people and

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.720
it's very easy to know who you might talk to

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.320
because everybody has this ******* number on their

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.400
head, this profit and loss number on their head.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.360
And everybody at, for example, Citibank, knows

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.040
who are the most profitable traders on this

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.040
trading floor. And if there's a guy over there

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.080
in another department, he's very profitable, I

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.720
can go and speak to him, and he's going to listen

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.000
to me because he knows that I'm very profitable.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.280
And there might be some people that are just

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.520
kind of chatting **** or they found a way to,

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.440
like, rip somebody off or steal some money.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.040
But you could very easily recognise, who

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.040
are the guys that we should maybe listen to?

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.480
Who are the guys that we should maybe discuss with?

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.320
And you can very easily make yourself visible as one

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.120
of those guys who should be made to be listened to.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.760
And this is why somebody like me from a

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.520
very poor background without any connections or

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.400
friends, was able to become kind of a legendary

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.200
trader within Citibank at the age of 24.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.680
Because trading is a space which allows

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.600
people with very good understanding to

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.680
make themselves very visible, very quickly.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.400
And I think we can't... we don't have a lot of

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.320
space in our society that are like that anymore.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.880
I think the only other place that I can think of,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.120
obviously, which kind of allows very good people to

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.120
become very visible at a very young age, is basically

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.120
football, or soccer for our American viewers.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.440
That's the only place where, because if you're

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.120
really good, you can be visible very quickly.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.520
Whereas, in this world of, like, public-facing

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.840
economics, the, the big struggle which I've had

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.160
in the last few years is, "Okay, I know I'm right.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.320
I know I'm very good at this.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.720
I know I can make a ton of money on it, but I actually

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.200
want to try to stop my society from collapsing.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.000
How do I get that visibility?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.280
How do I get that visibility?" And

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.760
it's been a real struggle.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.240
It's been a real frustration.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.000
And I developed this plan, basically, which was

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.840
I saw, and I think it's crazy that I had to do this...

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.880
I should probably add quickly before I explain

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.120
the plan I developed, I... First of all, I went

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.160
back to university, and I thought that I would be able

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.920
to say to the economists, you know, show them the way

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.200
that they're wrong, give them the data, give them the

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.720
evidence, and we could kinda have a discussion about it.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.840
So I went to do a master's at Oxford, 2017 to 2019,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.680
and at that time, I was, you know, just recently, one of

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.720
the most profitable interest rate traders in the world.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.560
We had a lecture about interest rates.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.480
I went to the professor, and I said, "Hey,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.120
you know, do you want to talk about why we've been so

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.400
wrong on interest rates for so long?" At that time,

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.920
we had been, you know, in every Western country

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.720
in the world, pretty much, we'd spent 10 years

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.000
predicting that rates would come up very quickly,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.440
which means the economy would normalise very quickly.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.480
And we'd been wrong for 10 years.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.320
And the professor said to me, "Oh, no, we always

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.920
knew rates would stay zero forever." Which, was

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.440
categorically, provably wrong, and I was amazed by that.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.000
So I sent him the data and I said, "Look, we can

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.960
see, actually, you've been wrong for 10 years.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.360
Do you want to talk about it?" And the guy was just

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.920
not in the slightest bit interested, basically.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.760
So this is the situation we're in, really.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.240
Academia doesn't really care

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.720
about being consistently wrong.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.800
Just after the recent Labour government was elected,

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.840
I was able to find myself in a room with,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.720
a senior Labour policy advisor, who I won't name.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.640
And I said the same thing to him.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.400
I was like, "Hey, look, you know,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.880
you've just won the election.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.200
You know, what are going to do about inequality?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.920
Because if you don't do anything about inequality,

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.480
then living standards will keep falling, and you

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.120
will be very unpopular, very, very quickly." And,

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.240
he knew who I was because this was not that

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.120
long ago, and his instant reply was

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.640
to talk to me about his sort of plan for how they

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.760
were going to deal with that from a comms perspective,

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.240
which was very frustrating for a policy advisor.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.160
But I think that kind of shows you what is

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.920
happening here, which is in trading, we've created

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.040
this space where young people, mainly young men,

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.480
compete very, very aggressively to be right, to

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.680
be right, to be right, to be right, to be right.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.120
And it allows us to relatively easily identify people

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.000
who have good understanding and who are right, but they

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.240
are then not allowed at all to have a public voice.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.760
And then you have this world of public-facing

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.520
economists in things like governments and

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.760
universities and think tanks and the media,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.000
and I honestly think most of these guys are

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.600
not really trying to be right, unfortunately.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.040
And that's not in a sense their fault.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.560
They are playing a different game, really.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.040
So if you are a trader, you're paid to be right, you're

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.120
rewarded to be right, you're incentivised to be right.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.200
But if you are an advisor to government,

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.440
your main thing is winning elections, right?

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.400
And if you want to win elections, you need

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.160
to think about your ******* comms strategy.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.320
So, I don't think it's really a

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.080
surprise that Labour policy advisors are

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.760
mainly thinking about comms strategy.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.040
And if you are a university professor in economics,

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.440
that is an phenomenally competitive job, but you are not

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.320
paid to understand why we're wrong on interest rates.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.720
These guys have to write lots of really, really

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.880
difficult complicated mathematical papers.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.000
There's this thing called publish or perish.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.960
You have to write more and more complicated

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.400
mathematical papers so that... The

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.080
economics professors, unfortunately, they

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.400
are also not really trying to be right.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.360
You know, if you work as an economist in the media,

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.880
realistically, obviously, these guys

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.920
are trying to get clicks, right?

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.200
That's the way the media works.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.720
That's the way that YouTube works.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.360
These guys working in public service are

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.480
not really incentivised to be right, and I

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.200
think that is why they don't really care when

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.600
somebody like me comes along and says, "Well,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.560
I've got a very good track record of being right.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.200
Do you want to listen?" So, I had to develop

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.240
a plan for how do we use this ability to be

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.800
consistently right to get ourselves some voice

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.600
and some power, essentially, in politics?

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.640
And my plan that started in sort of 2020, really,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.280
I thought there was a gap in YouTube.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.920
I thought political power was going to shift to YouTube,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.760
and I thought that the public... The great

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.520
thing about YouTube is I can keep doing this

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.920
thing which I do, which I have done in this video.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.520
I can say, "Go back and look at the

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.040
predictions that I made in 2020.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.080
Go back and watch the videos I made in 2020."

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.720
And I think that gives me a lot of credibility

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.040
because you can see I'm not just some guy

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.760
who's trying to, like, get clicks on YouTube.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.200
I'm a guy who has a very long

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.440
track record of being right.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.640
And, and the reason why my videos in 2020 have correct

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.960
predictions is the same reason I was Citibank's

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.120
best trader in the world,

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.160
which is, I'm ******* good

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.480
at this and I actually have a good understanding.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.080
And I think YouTube, in going directly

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.200
to the people, maybe gives us a way... Well,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.120
I was hoping would give us a bit of a way

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.960
to get leverage over the public.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.640
I needed to build that plan out, so I needed to

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.400
figure out how to bring the audience to the YouTube,

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.440
which is really why I wrote the book.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.240
And that was phenomenally successful.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.640
And now we get, you know, half a

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.080
million, a million views on every video.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.760
And I was kind of thinking, hoping, now that I

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.600
am not only formally best trader in the world for

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.320
Citibank, but also have a very good track record

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.840
of predicting online and am also the biggest

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.640
politics show in the country, bigger than Question

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.320
Time, maybe now the politicians will listen to me.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.080
But the truth is, unfortunately,

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.680
it seems that they still won't.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.680
And now you have a political party that is

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.240
supposed to be the center-left political party, so

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.280
stubbornly refusing to do anything about inequality and

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.600
taxation of the rich that not only will they collapse

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.080
the economy, they will also lose disastrously to a

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.520
new far-right political party in the next election.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.120
And they still won't listen.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:05.800
And it's insane and it's frustrating, and

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.320
it forces us to ask the question, what can we do?

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.520
Okay, so that is it.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.640
That is where we are.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.440
If you want to be the best trader in the world,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.960
all you need to do is understand something that

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.920
nobody else in the world, or the vast majority of

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.400
economists, don't understand about the economy.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.800
And, if you want something, I'll tell you it, the

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.960
exact thing I've made pretty much all my money on.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.840
Growing inequality of wealth is destroying the economy

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.520
and pretty much everything that happens

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.760
can be predicted by understanding what will

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.560
happen with growing inequality of wealth.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.160
The irony of this is, this is exactly the

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.200
message that I've been sending you in pretty

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.240
much every video for the last five years.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.720
So every single person who has sent me the message,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.040
"Can you please teach me, how to be the best trader

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.360
in the world?" has failed to realise that that is

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.600
exactly what I've been doing for the last five years.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.000
If you want to understand the economy better

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.280
than the economists, you can do that very, very

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.920
simply by understanding that growing inequality

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.240
of wealth is a massive economic driver.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.320
And that's true if you want to be a good trader,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.160
and it's true if you want to be in government.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.400
But the quid pro quo was that I asked you to think

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.360
about what this system will do to our society.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.120
So we have a system which very aggressively

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.120
takes all of our best young economic minds, sends

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.080
them to skyscrapers to bet on the end of the

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.040
world, and doesn't allow them to speak publicly.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.040
And when one of those traders comes out of the

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.320
skyscrapers and tries to tell the academics,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.160
the media, the politicians that their society is

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.200
going to collapse, for free, despite being worth

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.640
a couple of million pounds a year according

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.320
to the banks, the governments don't listen.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.240
What will that do to our society?

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.520
What will that do to our future?

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.400
So that's it, how to be

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.480
the best trader in the world.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.040
Leaving it on that note is a little bit depressing.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.600
And the truth is, I've been a little bit

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.960
depressed the last couple of months because we've

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.120
achieved so much here on this channel, and it is

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.920
so obvious that the governments need something new.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.200
And I think it should be unbelievably

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.560
painfully obvious that what they need is us.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.600
And yet they look like they are going to basically

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.480
commit suicide, die on the hill of not taxing the rich.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.600
And that is depressing.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.520
But I've told myself that in this new series,

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.640
we're not going to end the video on any depressing notes.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.000
So I want to finish by giving a

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.880
little bit of a message of hope.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.840
I don't think I've spoken

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.280
about this on the channel before.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.920
People sometimes ask me,

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.280
"What are you hopeful about?

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.400
What are you hopeful about?" And a few

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.080
years ago, just when Rishi Sunak had been

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.920
recently... Was he, was he just made Chancellor?

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.360
Was he just made Prime Minister?

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.000
I got sent to a little military town

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.720
in North Yorkshire called Colburn,

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.120
which is Rishi Sunak's constituency.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.360
And the plan was for me to go there, to go to a

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.880
food bank, and talk to some food bank users

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:17.000
about how they feel about their new... about their

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.560
MP being the richest MP in the history of the country.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.160
And I didn't love that idea because I thought

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.960
it was a little bit like poverty p**n, but

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.920
I went along with it because I thought, you

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.520
know, we might get some views, whatever.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.040
I wasn't that famous at the time.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.640
And when I went there, what I found was the

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.920
food bank was not being used as a food bank.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.320
And the reason for that was that it was the

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.160
weekend after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.200
and the food bank had been rapidly turned

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.720
into a kind of supply collection center.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.680
So people were sending in, you know, tinned

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.320
food and warm clothes and medicines and

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.320
stuff for babies and stuff like that.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.400
And the food bank was full of people, like, sorting

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.400
this stuff out, packing it into boxes, and they were

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.560
going to put the boxes into a van and these people from

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.040
North Yorkshire were going to drive themselves the van

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.320
all the way to Ukraine to deliver these supplies.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.400
And it kind of ****** my plan really, because the

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.440
food bank wasn't being used as a food bank, so

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.320
it wasn't full of these poverty p**n food bank

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.000
users, the poorest people in the area.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.640
But, you know, what else can you do?

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.800
I helped them, like, pack stuff

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.480
into boxes and I got talking to them.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.480
And what I found out when I was talking to them

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.080
was that they were the food bank users.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.440
The people that were there in the first

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.760
week of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.440
packing stuff into boxes, making donations

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.880
to drive to Ukraine, were food bank users.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.000
People who, in normal times,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.440
struggle to feed their kids.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.120
And yet when something bad happened to a bunch of people

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.040
from a different country with a different language

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.040
thousands of miles away, their first instinct was to go

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.520
down to the food bank and pack stuff into boxes to help.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.040
And when I see what's happening today, I spoke

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.720
in last week's video about going to the recent

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.000
protests outside the hotels and seeing people on

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.800
different side of the road shouting at each other,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.520
sometimes I worry that that vision, two

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.880
separate groups of people standing on opposite

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.200
sides of the road shouting names at each other,

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.240
is kind of a metaphor for our future as a country.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.520
And when I feel that way, I try to remember back to

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.760
this day that I went to Colburn in North Yorkshire,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.080
in a very poor, very deprived area, and seeing

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.240
the poorest people in our country packing stuff

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.280
into boxes to help people thousands of miles away.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.320
Because I suspect that some of those people might

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.840
be some of the same people going to these protests.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.720
What that tells me is that this country,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.920
and I'm sure it's true in your country too,

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.640
is not full of bad people.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.600
These people want a positive vision for the future.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.400
If we provide that, they will support us.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.760
And I want to do a shout-out here to all of the

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.200
economists who might be watching in the Labour

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.440
Party, in the Democratic Party, in whatever

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.600
political party all over the world, in the

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.040
universities, in the think tanks, in the media.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.360
I might have given the impression that I don't

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.840
think you guys are the smartest people in the world.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.200
You have an important part to play.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.080
You have an important part to play.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.360
I'm here.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.000
I'm ready to build it.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.880
If we create a story that will save ordinary

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.320
people from poverty, ordinary people across

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.880
the world are ready to get behind it.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.880
So that's it.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.880
How do you be the best trader in the world?

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.480
You bet on the end of the world.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.280
But maybe we should stop the end of the world.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.360
Tax wealth, not work.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.000
Make things better.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.800
Support the channel, tell your friends, tell your mum.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.280
Thank you.
