00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.760
workers are on sale for rich people because rich&nbsp;
people have made a ton of money, the price of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.400
everything has gone up and wages have not 
kept up&nbsp;so wages are cheap, workers are cheap,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.580
rich people are laughing right and ordinary 
people&nbsp;are struggling so that is why these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.900
are trying to hire more labour&nbsp;
because its super cheap for them

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.960
okay this one is strikes wages and the job&nbsp;
market in general what do we think about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.700
so there's been a lot of interesting economic&nbsp;
discussion of the job market in the last couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.280
of years since lockdown okay and a lot&nbsp;
of economists have been confused because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.000
wages have been falling significantly in real&nbsp;
terms and yet job vacancies are all-time lows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
so first let's cover this; are wages going&nbsp;
down or going up right because in real terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.600
sorry in nominal terms, wages are increasing the&nbsp;
fastest they've ever been for ages they're going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.660
about 4-5% a year but when we compare&nbsp;
it to inflation that's a real terms fall of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.180
negative five percent so first things first what&nbsp;
matters is the real value of your wages, wages are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.740
collapsing sometimes that's misconstrued in the&nbsp;
media they say wages are rising wages are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.300
wages are falling really really quickly, living standards 
are falling, why are economies confused okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.760
so if wages are falling they think well the job&nbsp;
market must be weak because wages are going down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
but there are super *high* vacancy levels&nbsp;
right so they're saying well that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.460
a sign that the job market is strong it's&nbsp;
easy to get a job because there's you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.940
sorry super high vacancy level so&nbsp;
there's really high vacancy levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.900
people are struggling to find workers right,&nbsp;
people wanna hire workers but the wages are low so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.900
is the job market strong or is the job market&nbsp;week? 
wages are falling - weak job market, companies are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.400
struggling to find workers - strong job market&nbsp;
and I think this can easily be understood if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.360
we understand that what happened during COVID 
was&nbsp;partially a massive devaluation of the currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.460
so we've been speaking from the very beginning&nbsp;
of the channel about the fact that since the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.900
beginning of COVID an enormous amount of money&nbsp;
has been distributed by governments across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.260
world, 700 billion pounds in the UK, 8 trillion&nbsp;
dollars in the US; massive amounts of cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.760
this cash has been accumulated largely in the bank&nbsp;
accounts of richer people, if people have way way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.140
way more money, effectively that means that money&nbsp;
has been devalued so what that means is the value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.000
of money is less so if the price of everything&nbsp;
is to stay the same it needs to go up, so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.800
say the value of money goes down 20%, the price of&nbsp;
everything needs to increase by 25% to offset that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.040
the problem is some prices are able to change much&nbsp;
more quickly than other prices so if Sainsbury's wants

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.020
to increase the price of its pasta, it's easy you&nbsp;
know it's not difficult to do you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.980
if the price of wheat on global markets or oil&nbsp;
needs to change it happens at the blink of an eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.680
some prices are easy to increase but your wage&nbsp;
is not easy to increase right you can't just be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.120
like oh well sorry currency's been devalued so&nbsp;
I'll give it myself a 20% wage increase right you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.460
can't do that, so what that means is, the prices&nbsp;
which companies can change automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.740
like basic goods and services, like the price of&nbsp;
basic essentials they all go up super quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.080
but your wage doesn't, this is what economists&nbsp;
call a 'sticky price' certain prices are hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.540
to change, you can't change your own wage, so&nbsp;
that means that all of the prices of goods and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.240
essentials goes up but your wage stays the same,&nbsp;
what does that mean? your wage has been cut so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.800
the devaluation of currency has allowed for a&nbsp;
significant cut in the wages of everybody in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.480
the country at the same time we've given enormous&nbsp;
amounts of cash to the richest 10,15,20 percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.420
but what does that mean? well companies have&nbsp;
the cost especially if you're selling to richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.440
people your business is booming because&nbsp;
people are flush with cash (richer people)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.740
wages are super cheap right because they've&nbsp;
been cut 10% real terms you're going to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.140
and hire more people simple and I think once you&nbsp;
understand that what's happened is a massive cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.840
in wages well then it makes sense of course there&nbsp;
are a lot of vacancies of course there are a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.640
of jobs because labour's really cheap, labour is&nbsp;
super cheap, richer people are flush with cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.520
&amp; I tell you if you go to central London it's&nbsp;booming,
it's booming because richer people who are&nbsp;the&nbsp;

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.220
people who go to restaurants in central London&nbsp;often, 
have got loadsa cash and labour is really really cheap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.400
so what has happened in the last two&nbsp;
three years is that the increase in inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.160
caused by COVID policy and the decrease in the&nbsp;
value of currency caused by COVID policy have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.960
allowed a massive decrease in real wages which is&nbsp;
the main reason why living standards have fallen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.000
which is why we see what we see in the&nbsp;
job market so that raises the question&nbsp;of&nbsp;

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
what do we think about the strikes?&nbsp;
what do we think about people's wages? 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.480
well of course it's totally unacceptable that living&nbsp;
standards for nurses for teachers are collapsing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.760
at the same time as we have seen the largest and&nbsp;
fastest ever increase in millionaire billion a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.420
month in the country it's totally unacceptable&nbsp;
and these people should get a pay increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.880
but you have the problem of it's very difficult&nbsp;
to fix the symptoms, if you don't fix the cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.080
700 billion pounds has been transferred&nbsp;
from the government to the richest people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.340
in the country, the government's financial&nbsp;
situation has deteriorated, it's as simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.800
as that, the government's financial situation has&nbsp;
deteriorated and if the government is super&nbsp;poor&nbsp;

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.600
how do they pay a decent public sector wage?&nbsp;
you see what I'm saying so of course 100 percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.220
government workers, NHS workers, teachers should get&nbsp;
their pay increases they shouldn't be accepting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.600
what they are asking which is five-ten percent&nbsp;(real)
decrease in wages, when the rich are making a ton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.080
of money, but the question which is never spoken&nbsp;
about has to be spoken about more of where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.260
money comes from needs to be discussed because&nbsp;
if you don't tax the rich who've made a ton of&nbsp;money

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.800
then you're going to end up taxing ordinary
working people are increasingly being squeezed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.260
so should the public sector workers get their
pay increases? yes, who should pay for it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.400
the group of people who've seen the biggest&nbsp;
and fastest ever increase in their wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.600
and their living standards in the history of&nbsp;
the country which is the rich &amp; the super rich

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.620
Thank You

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.080
money currently is flowing from the&nbsp;
government to the rich, leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.800
government with big piles of debt and&nbsp;
the rich with big piles of money there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.940
there's 1 other thing they can do with that massive&nbsp;
amount of income, they can buy your mum's house!
