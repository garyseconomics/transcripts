sell<00:00:31.199><c> it</c><00:00:31.359><c> unless</c><00:00:31.599><c> you</c><00:00:31.679><c> have</c><00:00:31.840><c> it</c><00:00:32.079><c> so</c><00:00:32.239><c> the</c><00:00:32.399><c> way</c><00:00:32.480><c> it</c>

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
sell it unless you have it so the way it
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
sell it unless you have it so the way it
works<00:00:32.880><c> is</c><00:00:33.120><c> first</c><00:00:33.360><c> you</c><00:00:33.520><c> have</c><00:00:33.680><c> to</c><00:00:33.840><c> borrow</c><00:00:34.239><c> it</c><00:00:34.399><c> and</c>

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
works is first you have to borrow it and
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.350 align:start position:0%
works is first you have to borrow it and
then<00:00:34.719><c> you</c><00:00:34.880><c> sell</c><00:00:35.120><c> it</c>

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
then you sell it
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
then you sell it
so<00:00:35.520><c> i</c><00:00:35.600><c> think</c><00:00:35.760><c> it's</c><00:00:35.920><c> easier</c><00:00:36.079><c> if</c><00:00:36.239><c> you</c><00:00:36.320><c> imagine</c>

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i think it's easier if you imagine
 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.430 align:start position:0%
so i think it's easier if you imagine
say<00:00:37.360><c> the</c><00:00:37.520><c> example</c><00:00:37.840><c> of</c><00:00:37.920><c> a</c><00:00:38.000><c> library</c><00:00:38.320><c> book</c><00:00:38.559><c> okay</c>

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
you borrow the library book and then you
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.069 align:start position:0%
you borrow the library book and then you
sell<00:00:40.800><c> it</c><00:00:40.879><c> straight</c><00:00:41.120><c> away</c><00:00:41.520><c> but</c><00:00:41.680><c> remember</c><00:00:42.000><c> you</c>

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
sell it straight away but remember you
 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.350 align:start position:0%

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
already fallen so you buy it back for
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
already fallen so you buy it back for
cheaper

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.830 align:start position:0%

you<00:00:50.480><c> give</c><00:00:50.640><c> it</c><00:00:50.719><c> back</c><00:00:50.879><c> to</c><00:00:50.960><c> the</c><00:00:51.039><c> library</c><00:00:51.520><c> happy</c>

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
you give it back to the library happy
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
you give it back to the library happy
days<00:00:52.160><c> you're</c><00:00:52.320><c> done</c><00:00:53.039><c> if</c><00:00:53.199><c> the</c><00:00:53.280><c> price</c><00:00:53.520><c> hasn't</c>

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
days you're done if the price hasn't
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.510 align:start position:0%
days you're done if the price hasn't
already<00:00:54.160><c> fallen</c><00:00:54.559><c> you</c><00:00:54.640><c> might</c><00:00:54.960><c> try</c><00:00:55.120><c> and</c><00:00:55.199><c> extend</c>

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
already fallen you might try and extend
 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.150 align:start position:0%
already fallen you might try and extend
that<00:00:55.760><c> loan</c>

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
that loan
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.990 align:start position:0%
that loan
so<00:00:56.320><c> that's</c><00:00:56.640><c> how</c><00:00:56.800><c> short</c><00:00:57.039><c> selling</c><00:00:57.360><c> works</c><00:00:57.840><c> but</c>

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that's how short selling works but
 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.430 align:start position:0%
so that's how short selling works but
the<00:00:58.160><c> stock</c><00:00:58.480><c> market</c><00:00:58.879><c> has</c><00:00:59.039><c> been</c>

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the stock market has been
 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.470 align:start position:0%
the stock market has been

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
far from ordinary what if two weeks
 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.110 align:start position:0%
far from ordinary what if two weeks
comes

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
comes
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.710 align:start position:0%
comes
and<00:01:03.280><c> suddenly</c><00:01:03.840><c> the</c><00:01:04.000><c> library</c><00:01:04.320><c> says</c><00:01:04.479><c> you</c><00:01:04.559><c> can't</c>

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
and suddenly the library says you can't
