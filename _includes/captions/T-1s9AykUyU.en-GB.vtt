00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.760
Okay.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.880
I've got to be honest, I didn't

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.280
really do this video this week.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.800
We've had a very busy three months on the channel.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.600
I've been working a bit too hard.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.440
We were just getting ready, if I'm

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.800
totally honest, to wind things down and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.440
I was hoping to take a little holiday.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.000
But obviously, the world's gone

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720
totally mad in the last week or so.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.800
So, against my better judgment, we are going

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.320
to do a video on tariffs and Donald Trump.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
Okay, so the first thing I want to say is,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.920
usually, well, always, I do this video

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360
with... these videos with no scripts.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.960
And my philosophy basically is,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.160
if you really, really understand a thing

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920
really well, you don't need a script.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960
You can just come on, explain the thing

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.280
as clearly as possible, and that will

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.600
be the best way to educate an audience.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.840
So before the videos, I don't write a script.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.280
I spend most of my time thinking about and talking

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.000
about and researching the thing I'm going

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.920
to discuss in the aim of basically getting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.400
the clearest understanding on that thing.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.360
And I've spent last week, as have most economists

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.560
in the world, talking to people about the Trump

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640
tariffs and the absolute madness we've been seeing

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.760
in the last week, trying to figure it out and,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.560
basically, everybody is losing their minds.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.960
It's really, really difficult.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.720
It's really difficult just to get

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.280
like unbiased opinions.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.960
Everyone is... like a lot of people, especially

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.760
outside America, really, really, really hate

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.920
Donald Trump and think he's like insane.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.160
Some people really, really

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.920
love him and think he's a genius.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.720
There's a lot of discussion as to whether

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.240
he's even the brains behind this.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.200
Is there some kind of massive plan?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.320
Is it just like a massive **** up?

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.600
And I've been fishing through this as... just

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.480
like everybody else, trying to understand it.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.280
I'd be lying to you if I said I have

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.360
the 100% complete truth on what's happening.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.720
But I've been thinking about it a lot.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.760
I've been trying my best to understand it, and I think

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.160
the best thing to do, and what I'm going to try

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
to do today, is really slow it down, really

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.480
unwind it, and just try to explain in as

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.720
basic possible terms what I think is happening.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.320
Where I think it's relevant,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.120
I'll give other opinions.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.960
And what I want to do is use this crazy thing that's

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.360
happened as an opportunity to unpack some important

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.720
basic economic concepts, which I think will help

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.320
you to understand what is happening in the world.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.480
So before I do that, I just want to refer back to the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.360
video that I did about 10 weeks ago when my

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.640
book came out, which was also when, basically when

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.560
Trump was inaugurated, called Truth, Lies, and Games,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.040
where I spoke about how powerful people, and like a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.960
really good example of this is Donald Trump, because

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.040
we could already see it in his first presidency.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.760
They say a lot of things and they do a lot

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.720
of things that are intended to cause effect

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080
that may not necessarily be related to what they

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.960
actually want or what they actually believe.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.480
And it can be quite destabilising as an ordinary person

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.520
to witness that, because you're in a situation where

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.200
you have these very powerful people who have a lot of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.160
power over you, saying things and doing things

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.680
which they very, very quickly turn back on, which it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.280
seems that they were maybe never really serious about,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520
which it seems were not really what they were going to do.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.200
And you're getting all of these

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.800
conflicting, disorientating messages.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.880
And the first thing to say is I think it is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.400
really phenomenally stressful for a lot of people.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.960
And even I myself, who am, you know,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.000
quite a rich person and I'm not likely to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.680
be severely personally affected by anything

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.560
that's happening, I found it stressful.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.720
The economists that I speak to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.120
who are also mostly quite rich people,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.400
comfortable people, have found it stressful.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.200
So this has probably been quite stressful

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.320
for you, and some of the potential consequence

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.720
of what's happened could be very serious.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.960
So one of the reasons why I want to kind of slow

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.160
it down and try my best to use it to do like

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
a really educational video is because I think

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.800
it's important to try not to panic, basically.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.440
I know it can be, it can be difficult

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.000
when all kinds of things are going on.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.960
But if you understand it, I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.360
think it's less stressful.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.120
So today, we're going to try my best

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.000
to go slowly, explain, and educate.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.080
This is a decaf, which is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.160
hopefully going to keep me going slow.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Okay.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
So let's give a brief summary of what actually happened.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.920
So I'm filming this on Thursday the 10th of April.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.840
It's lucky we didn't film this yesterday.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.360
And we're going to go out on

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.960
Sunday, so in three days time.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.840
This is a live and moving situation, and

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.800
it's totally possible that by the time

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.720
this video comes out, everything's changed.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.640
But at this point on Thursday, things

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.320
do seem to have finally calmed down.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.440
Donald Trump has backtracked

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.880
on the majority of the tariffs.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.160
Markets have calmed.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.320
So hopefully, this will still be live

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.360
and active and relevant by the time

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.520
the ch- by the time the video comes out.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.600
So let's talk a little bit first about

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.040
the background to this situation.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.640
You guys will probably know that in the last week,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.160
Trump announced like a kind of insane massive

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.360
package of tariffs, and then relatively,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.680
well, caused an enormous market panic

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400
and relatively quickly backtracked on it.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.920
But let's talk about the logic behind it,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.320
because I think there's some really interesting ideas

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.160
which are sometimes not clearly unpacked,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.000
which can help you understand what's going on.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.080
So the first thing you need to understand is what

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.400
a trade deficit is. Because this is a big part of

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.080
the logic, the theory underpinning the tariffs.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.080
Okay, so trade deficits.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.840
Really important concept in economics,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.120
not too difficult to explain.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.480
So say we've got two countries.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.920
Here we've got the USA, here we've got China.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.080
But to be honest, I can really put

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.120
anywhere in Asia, much of the world.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.200
Now, the USA and China are both independent

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400
economies, both doing their thing, producing

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.360
goods and services, consuming, investing,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.360
but they're also trading with each other.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.320
So the USA is selling goods and services to China.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.400
From the USA's perspective, these are exports.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.440
And China is selling goods and services to the USA.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.280
From the USA's perspective, these are imports.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.000
It's not a problem.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.920
This is the way the world works.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.920
But one problem you have here is the USA is

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.880
a rich country and wages are quite high.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.640
If you've ever been to the USA, especially in the last

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.280
few years, you will see that the USA is expensive.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.840
It's much more expensive than really

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.040
anywhere else in the world at the moment.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.840
China is, it's becoming richer, but

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.360
especially if we talk about other Asian countries,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.240
this is a much poorer country.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.280
If you go to China or South East

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.320
Asia, prices are lower, wages are lower.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.120
And what that means is, it's difficult for

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.400
Asian people to buy a lot of exports from

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.720
the USA because these exports are expensive.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.520
Whereas Americans are getting richer

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.320
and richer, the dollar is quite expensive,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.920
especially since COVID, these guys can buy a lot.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.480
So the amount going from China to the USA is a lot more

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.920
than the amount going from the USA to China.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.480
What you have here is a trade imbalance.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:09.280
And from the USA's perspective, it is a trade deficit.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.360
Now how is this balanced out?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.200
How is this possible?

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.600
The answer's really quite simple, and it's

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.720
just the same as if I was buying from you

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.000
more than you were buying from me.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.120
The way that we would balance this

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.080
out is I would give you money.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.920
Basically, you have to give some form of wealth.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.160
And what economists call this is the capital account.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.560
So they will say if you have a trade imbalance, you

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.560
will have to balance out with a capital account.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.040
But to be honest, I wouldn't

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.720
worry about this economics term.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.720
I would say you balance this out with flows of wealth.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.160
And the reason I want to use the term flows of wealth is

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.920
because this is a term which I use a lot on the channel.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.600
Now, if you have been watching the channel

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.320
for a long time, you will know that I am very

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.800
worried about flows of wealth in our society.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.240
I talk a lot about how the working class

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.240
and the middle class and the government

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.760
have lost their wealth over time to the super

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.160
rich, who have gotten richer and richer and richer.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.040
And really, what is happening here

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.920
is in some senses a similar concept.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.080
China is sending a lot of imports to the USA.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.240
USA is not sending so much exports.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.240
And as a result, what you are getting

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.360
is a flow of wealth.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.000
And this can take the form of actual literal

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.560
assets in the USA being owned by China, or

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.160
more commonly, it's taken the form of debt.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.320
And this is really the same here.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.000
It's really the same.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.040
You've seen the working class lose

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.120
their assets and go into debt.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.200
You've seen the middle class

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.680
losing assets and going into debt.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.560
You've seen the government losing

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.520
their assets and going into debt.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520
And it's the same thing here.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.000
The USA is increasingly in debt to China

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.840
because it has this trade imbalance.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.480
And I was actually thinking about making a

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.200
video talking about this for a long time, because

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.640
this idea that I talk about at the bottom,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.280
of wealth flowing within society, away from

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.920
the working class, the middle class, the government,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.760
to the super rich, is really mirrored in this

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.840
idea that economists have about trade deficits.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.160
And it's interesting that economists are

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.720
willing to talk about and discuss wealth

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.120
flowing out of the USA, and in fact make kind of

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.400
semi-insane policies, as we've seen last week.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.920
But they're never talking about wealth flowing

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.400
away from the working class, away from the

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.280
middle class, away from the government.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.560
But that said, this is an important problem.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.760
You know, if wealth is flowing out of the USA, you might

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.960
see, for example, less factories being built in the USA.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.800
Factories instead are being built in China, in Asia.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.160
And that might cause problems

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.000
such as low wages and that might cause

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.800
problems such as unemployment in the US.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.600
So the first thing I want to say is

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.680
the idea behind tariffs to reduce the US

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.920
trade deficit is not necessarily a bad idea.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.200
And it's addressing a real problem, which

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.080
is, you know, not a lot of good quality jobs in the

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.920
US, low wages in the US, especially for the poor.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.600
And we're seeing the same problems

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.280
in the UK, seeing the same problems in

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.240
most of Europe, but not all of Europe.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.040
So the first thing to say is

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.280
trade deficits, interesting idea.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.120
Wealth is flowing away from the US in the same

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.840
way it's flowing away from ordinary people.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.680
And their plan to address this is to bring tariffs in.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.840
And tariffs, it's kind of

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.880
the obvious solution, right?

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.480
You want to get rid of some of these imports and

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.880
then you want to get rid of the flows of wealth.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.320
That's what you're hoping to do.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.240
You want wealth to... You want

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.560
to stop importing so much.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.480
You want to start producing it domestically.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.440
You want to create jobs in your country, and you

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.320
want to stop wealth flooding out of the country.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.080
And their whole plan to do that is to raise tariffs

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.120
and use those tariffs to reduce income taxes.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.800
And as soon as you hear that, you can see immediately,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.400
wow, from what in politics or media we

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.560
would call a comms perspective, a communications

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.560
perspective, that is such a sexy sounding policy.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.640
You can tax foreigners, *******

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.760
foreigners, we all hate foreigners.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.480
Foreigners are super unpopular nowadays.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.240
And you can use it to reduce

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.920
good old-fashioned income tax.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.960
We all hate income tax.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.440
And give that money back to red,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.440
white and blue blooded real Americans.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.120
Fantastic, sexy policy.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.600
The problem with that is

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.360
that tariffs are a regressive tax.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.840
And in order to understand this problem, we are

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.160
going to have to now explain regressive taxation.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.320
Okay, so regressive taxation is a

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.560
commonly understood term in economics.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.160
I don't think I've used this, term on the

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.600
channel before, but it's important to understand,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.840
especially if you want to understand tariffs.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.880
So how do we explain?

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.360
So, the first thing is, I think the best

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.960
way to explain it is to start off by

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.560
explaining what proportional taxation is.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.960
So proportional taxation is basically the concept

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.080
which is actually getting quite popular nowadays

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.680
in some of the alt-right, the idea of a flat tax.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.040
Which means everybody pays tax at the exact

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.280
same rate as a percentage of their income.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.720
So let's say we had a flat tax of 20%.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.680
If you made £10,000 income,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.960
you would pay just £2,000 tax.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.160
If you made a million pounds income,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.440
you would pay £200,000 tax.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.560
In every case, you're paying 20%.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.240
If you are having more income, you are

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.560
paying more tax, but your tax as a percentage

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.600
of your income is staying totally the same.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.120
So if we were to put this on a graph,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.640
where this is your income and this is your tax rate

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.080
as a percentage of your income, it's going

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.120
to be just totally a flat line here at 20%.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.440
Very, very simple.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.760
Proportional taxation.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.760
But, in general, we don't use proportional

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.800
taxation, and I think you can see the

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.080
reason why when you look back at this.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.080
So imagine if you were making only £10,000.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.200
£10,000 is a very low income.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200
If you're making £10,000, you're probably going to

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.480
struggle just to pay the bills, just to pay the rent.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.840
So if we tax you £2,000, you're

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.960
probably not going to have that £2,000.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.200
If your income is £10,000, you're going to

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.360
spend all of that money on basic essentials

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.640
and your disposable income will be nothing.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.040
So it's going to be basically impossible

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.840
to tax poor people at the same rate as rich

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.480
people because poor people would literally starve.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.400
They would become homeless.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.520
They would not be able to pay the bills.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.680
So we choose, generally, in Western societies,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.960
including the US, including the UK, to

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.360
use what we call progressive taxation.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.880
And progressive taxation is, we all know a form

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.520
of progressive taxation, which is income tax.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.440
So income tax in the UK, in the

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.640
US, in Europe is a progressive tax.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.360
What that means is you pay a

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.760
higher rate than what you earn.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.760
So, I'm going to round these numbers to

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.280
make them a little bit simpler.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.760
In the UK, up to £12,000, you pay 0%, and this kind of

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.360
makes sense because even if you're earning £12,000, that

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.560
is basically not enough to live on in this country.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.160
So you don't have any money.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.080
We shouldn't be taxing you.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.000
It would be absurd.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.360
You would starve.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.800
So we're not paying any tax up to £12,000.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:36.920
Then from £12,000 up to £50,000 you are paying 20%.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.560
I want to make it clear because this is

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.440
a common misconception, that 20% only

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.240
applies to the amount above £12,000.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.320
So it's not like once you go above £12,000

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.520
you're suddenly paying 20% on everything.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.040
So that means as your income goes up, your

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.520
effective tax rate will gradually move away

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.400
from 0% towards 20% as you go from 12 to 50.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.560
So the more you earn, the higher rate you're

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.000
paying, and it's gradually increasing.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.480
Then on amounts of 50... Terrible handwriting here.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.880
To 125.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.720
I got in a lot of trouble at

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.360
school for my bad handwriting.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.320
Then you're paying 40%, and again

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.480
you only pay 40% on above that 50.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.600
And we have an extra rate for 125 plus which is 45%.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.800
So what this means is because this... because

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.840
these gradually step up on only the amounts above,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.400
you end up with a graph that looks kind of like this.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.400
Here's your income, here is your tax rate.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.440
It's zero until £12,000 then it starts to go up

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.840
to like 20%, then it starts to go up a bit more.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.960
It kind of looks like this.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.400
You have this kind of stepped graph

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.880
and it will never go above 45%.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.600
Over time you'll get close to 45%, this kind of...

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.200
So the higher... That's extremely messy line.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.200
But as you can see, the more income

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.840
you make, the higher your tax rate.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.880
It's never less than zero obviously,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.760
and it never reaches more than 45%.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.520
This is a progressive tax rate and what this means

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.520
is that tax... the tax burden falls increasingly on

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.360
the people who can afford to pay it and you're not

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.000
charging tax to people who can't afford to pay it,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.160
and this means that people don't die of starvation,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.320
they don't become homeless, and it means that tax

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.080
is being paid by richer people who can afford to pay

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.640
tax, and this is why we have progressive taxation

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.840
and progressive taxation is the reason why we have

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.400
a middle class and the reason why your

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.640
kids can go to school in this country and they

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.520
can't go to school in a lot of countries in the

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.800
poor world because we have progressive taxation.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.400
This is a good form of taxation in

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.560
the opinion of me and most economists.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.440
So once you've got progressive taxation and proportional

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.040
taxation, there is one other form of taxation

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.600
which tariffs are, and that is regressive taxation.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.760
So let's cover that.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.640
Okay, so what is regressive taxation?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.800
So in this country, we have a well-known form

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.400
of regressive taxation which is the council tax.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.960
So council tax, for those who are not in the UK,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.600
is basically tax you pay for living in a home which

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.240
everybody... pretty much everybody has to do.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.120
And when it was originally introduced, the

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.800
idea was that more expensive homes paid more,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.720
but they've kind of messed about with it over

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.360
time and it's ended up in a place where kind

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.320
of everybody pays like almost a similar amount.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.720
That is a simplification, but for the

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.840
purpose of explaining what regressive

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.160
taxation is, let's assume that what council

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.760
tax is, is everybody pays £2,000 a year.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.120
Everybody pays £2,000 a year.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.840
Doesn't matter what your income is.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.440
So you might see, "Oh, everybody pays the same.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.040
It's fantastic.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.200
That's like really, really fair.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.040
Everybody pays the same." But the problem is even if

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.920
your income is £2,000 a year, you pay £2,000 a year.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.600
And even if your income is

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.680
£2 million a year, you're paying £2,000 a year.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.360
So the poorest people in the country are paying

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.880
100% of their income and the richest people in

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.880
the country are paying, that's going to be 0.1%.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.880
So a regressive tax is like this.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.480
It taxes the poor at an extremely high rate

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.680
and it taxes the rich at an extremely low rate.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.640
So if we were to draw that as

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.320
a graph, here is your income.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.200
Your council tax rate is... Actually, as your

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.760
income grows to zero, it becomes like

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
infinite so we can't... It's going to be this kind of

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.160
classic, what in maths we call a parabolic graph.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.360
The poorer you are, the higher your tax rate.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.520
And these are bad.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.920
This is bad because it means that

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.520
the tax burden is falling

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.480
overwhelmingly on the poor and the very poor.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.480
So why are tariffs a regressive tax?

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:51.080
The answer is... So income tax taxes you on your income.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.360
But tariffs are a tax that taxes you on what you buy.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.800
So actually, we have these kinds of taxes

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.160
already, which you'll be familiar with.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.160
We have, in the UK, we have VAT

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.000
and we have, in the US, sales tax.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.480
These are consumption taxes instead of income taxes.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.680
Now you might think, "Well, that's not such

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.880
a big deal because rich people consume more.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.400
Rich people spend more money, so rich people will

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.520
pay more in consumption taxes." And that is true.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.840
The problem is something that we've spoken about a

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.840
number of times on this channel, which is that rich

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.720
people have a low marginal propensity to consume.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.240
I don't know why I always write

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.680
in capitals on this channel.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.840
In real life, I do use lowercase letters.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.800
So what this means is... So if

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.720
we consider poor people... Probably shouldn't.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720
People who have lower income,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.200
they don't have that much money, it's hard to

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.640
live, they spend basically everything they get.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.000
Whereas if you consider somebody like... I've

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.280
often used Rishi Sunak as an example or Elon

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.960
Musk, somebody who has a passive income of

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.320
£20, £30 million, £50 million, £1 billion

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.960
a year, they can't spend hardly any of that.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.080
So the bigger your income, the lower you spend

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.720
as a proportion of your income.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.680
So if we put spending here and income here,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.760
somebody who spent all of their income

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.480
would always be on this straight line.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.880
Their income is exactly equal to their spending.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.520
But in real life, the richer you get,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.960
the less and less of your income you spend.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.760
So these lines kind of separate.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.040
So what this means is rich people spend

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.200
a very low percentage of their income.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.760
Poor people spend a very high

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.000
percentage of their income.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.800
So if we tax people based on their spending

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.000
rather than their income, then the richest people

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.320
will get taxed at the lowest rate.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:09.840
So what this means is tariffs and VAT and sales tax,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.960
taxes are all regressive taxes, which means

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.240
they fall overwhelmingly on the poor.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.520
So if your plan is to replace income tax with

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.120
tariffs or VAT or sales tax, then you are taking

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.480
money away from the poorest people in a society

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.360
because they have the highest rate of spending and

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.680
you are giving that money to the richest people

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.800
in society because they have the highest income.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.120
So a shift away from income tax to tariffs is like

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.880
increasing VAT, it's like increasing sales taxes.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.960
It will hurt the poorest and the way they will see

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.600
that pain is not money being taken out of their pay

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.400
packet, which is what people are used to seeing.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.960
They will see it in higher prices,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.960
otherwise known as inflation.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.360
All right.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.160
So those are the basic concepts you need to

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.760
understand to understand what's happened.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.360
And now let's talk about the implementation.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:04.720
Okay.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.080
So we had been expecting the US

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.040
government and the Donald Trump government to

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.240
be doing something on tariffs for some time.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.360
And they finally came out with the actual

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.200
policy on, I believe it was Thursday last week.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.000
They brought out this board,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.200
maybe you flash up a picture.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.120
You've probably all seen it.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.200
They, they brought out this

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.400
little cardboard thing that listed the

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.280
tariffs that they were going to be implementing.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:41.960
And the highest rates were overwhelmingly applied

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.640
to basically some of the poorest

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.880
countries in the entire world.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.800
The highest rates were on places like

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.400
Cambodia and Laos in Southeast

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.560
Asia, which are very poor countries.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.920
Places like Vietnam and places like

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.000
Lesotho, which is tiny, poor country in South Africa.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.680
Places like Bangladesh.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.040
And the reason why the rates were highest on

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.400
these countries is because they basically chose

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.040
to apply the highest rates to the countries

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.400
which had the biggest trade surpluses with the US.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.760
So as we've explained it's quite normal

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.360
in a capitalist world for very rich countries

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.160
to have quite big trade deficits with very poor

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.720
countries, because poor countries cannot afford to buy

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.880
almost any American things, because America is a very

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.000
high wage economy, internationally, whereas the high

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.560
wage workers in America can afford to buy a lot from,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.560
for example, Cambodia, which is a very poor country.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.400
What they called these, and what

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.520
people were expecting was, they

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.960
called these reciprocal tariffs.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.520
People were expecting Trump to target primarily,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.280
countries which had higher tariffs on the US,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.280
but instead, they chose to target countries which

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.160
had very high trade surpluses with the US, which meant

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.160
targeting basically some of the poorest countries

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.360
in the entire world, which is kind of insane, basically.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.360
You know, the reason... Take Cambodia,

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.600
which is a very poor country with

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.360
phenomenally high levels of poverty, which has,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.440
similarly to other countries like Bangladesh,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.520
basically built up an industry of sweatshops.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.480
You know, extremely low wage, low

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.440
working condition factories where people

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.080
often work in pretty bad conditions, make extremely

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.640
cheap clothes to export to the United States.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.160
If you tax these countries, what you are doing

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.800
is applying a very heavy tax on the goods produced by

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.760
some of the poorest people in the world, who produce

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.760
very cheap clothes to be consumed by the poorest

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.040
people in your country, in a theoretical attempt to

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.520
move the worst jobs in the world back to your country.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.080
It doesn't make really any sense,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:19.160
and in doing that, you... If... Trump has

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.920
backed out on these tariffs now...

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.960
This would have killed people in Cambodia.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.800
There is no question about it.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.960
The country has basically

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.680
built up an industry based on exporting to

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.840
the US, exporting these very cheap clothes to the US.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.440
If those factories had been forced to suddenly close

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.040
down, yeah, there would've been a lot of deaths, of

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.360
poverty, of starvation in Cambodia it would have caused,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.800
not just Cambodia, in Laos, in Bangladesh,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.520
It would have caused really phenomenal

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.400
humanitarian economic crises in those countries.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.040
But even if you, even if you ignore what it would do

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.920
to the poor in some of the poorest parts of the world,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.160
what you gain from it is driving up the costs of the

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.200
cheapest clothes in your country, which are an essential

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.120
good for the poorest people in your country, in a

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.040
theoretical attempt to bring sweatshops back to the USA.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.160
It didn't make any sense.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.840
And you're also targeting countries here

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.880
like Laos, like Cambodia, which are right next to China.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.840
Laos shares a border with China.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.520
Cambodia is very close.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.440
Basically, you are attacking the key potential

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.880
strategic allies who are immediately next to your key

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.960
longterm political, military, economic, strategic rival

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.280
in China, in what appears to be an attempt just to drive

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.800
people both outside and inside your country, the poorest

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.360
people outside and inside your country, into poverty.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.840
It was the... Or whatever you think of

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.240
tariffs, and I don't think tariffs are

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.840
necessarily a bad policy, the implementation was

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.480
totally insane, I think, and this started a long

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.280
discussion, and I've been having this discussion

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.080
quite a lot with people in the last week or so.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.200
I thought that what you saw there was

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.840
low competence implementation.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.080
And a lot of people don't like to believe that.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.760
A lot of people like to believe that

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.800
the US government is high competence,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.040
and I would like to believe that as well.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.320
So some people were saying basically that I can't

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.280
think, and nobody can think of an economic rationale

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.280
for attacking Cambodia economically and for attacking

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.760
Bangladesh economically, and attacking... You know,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.600
they even raised tariffs significantly on Taiwan and

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.240
Japan and South Korea, who again, these are, these

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.960
guys have been for a long period of time, the US's

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.840
key strategic allies against China in the region.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.160
But at least in some of those cases, you

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.880
can say, you know, Japan does have high

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.440
value added good job manufacturing,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.680
which you might want to move back to the US.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.440
I couldn't really see any logic at

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.160
all in attacking Cambodia and Laos.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.920
And I was saying to people, "I think this

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.640
shows basically low competence." And people would

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.880
say, "Well, that..." This is the argument against that

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.720
was that, "Well, actually, we know it's stupid to attack

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.160
Cambodia and Laos, but the reason they're doing that is

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.160
because if you attack," unbelievably aggressively, like

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.120
these, if these terrorists had gone in, I don't think

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.080
you can overestimate the, the, the scale of the economic

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.360
disaster it would have caused in Cambodia and Laos.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.360
"If you attack these extremely poor and weak countries

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.800
aggressively, you will force them to make immediate

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.160
concessions, and it provides a great sort of short

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.960
term media wins for Donald Trump, which allows him

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.360
to sort of look strong." So you crush the

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.600
poorest in the world, they immediately give up,

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.080
and then that gives you leverage against China.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.040
But then if your plan was to relocate industry back

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:10.960
into the US, how do you achieve that by bringing in

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.880
pretend tariffs which you're only using to score points

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.560
in the media and you're immediately going to cancel?

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.360
You know, if I am a businessman and I... I'm

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.200
thinking about building a factory and the US brings

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.160
in tariffs, which I know that they're going to cancel

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.040
within a week, I'm not going to build a factory in

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.320
that co- it doesn't... So there's th- to be honest, I

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.280
think that there was quite a lot of cope really,

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.320
which is people seeing this insane thing happen and not

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.440
wanting to believe that it comes from low competency.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.360
It's difficult for me not to be reminded

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.440
of what happened in the Liz Truss situation.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.280
And what this really made me think of,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.840
and it's the next thing I want to introduce,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.720
is basically questions about theories of change.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.440
How do you improve the economy?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.200
And what this reminded me of was, so I went

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.200
on a podcast with Krishnan Guru-Murthy, who

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.480
is a very well-known news presenter here in the UK,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.360
and we discussed the things I always discuss,

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.560
which are the collapse of the economy

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.840
and the need to raise tax on the rich.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.760
And, Krishnan Guru-Murthy asked me a question which

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.960
I get asked a lot, which is, "If you were chancellor,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.560
what would you do?" And I get asked this question

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.760
quite a lot, and I got quite frustrated because

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.160
I've been asked it a lot and I said, "Listen,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.840
if I was chancellor, there'd be nothing I could

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.560
do." You don't fix this just by one guy becoming

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.800
chancellor, developing a whole economic tax policy in

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.880
a room by himself without any oversight, without any

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.840
discussion, and suddenly applying it on the world.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.040
What I'm trying to do here is not be the

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.920
guy who redesigns the global tax policy

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.400
by myself whilst making YouTube videos.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.040
I am trying to raise awareness of the fact

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.120
that if you do not deal with growing wealth

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.880
inequality by changing the tax system, you will

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.600
see really dramatic collapses in living standards.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.560
And what I want to do is open that conversation up and

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.960
have really an army of ordinary people behind

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.920
me, forcing the rich to have that conversation

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.680
so we can discuss the best way to fix the tax system.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.840
But the way that I constantly get asked,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.960
"What would you do if you were chancellor?

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.880
What would you do if you were chancellor?"

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.360
reveals to me quite an immature, quite a childish

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.240
approach a lot of people, even in the media, seem to

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.600
have towards politics and economics, which is the way

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.160
to fix the economic system is to get one guy or one

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.080
small group of people and ask them to totally rewrite

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.440
the economic rules without any broader discussion.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.520
When I see things like what Liz Truss did a couple

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.280
of years ago and what the Trump administration

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:08.040
have done now, it really looks to me as if that's

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.720
what they think fixing an economy looks like.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.720
And I want to be clear, people like Liz Truss

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.840
and people like the Trump administration,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.960
they are correct in identifying that there

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.000
are massive problems in the economic system.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.640
Bigger and bigger percentages of rich economies,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.160
like the US, like Europe, like the UK, are

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.320
falling into poverty and we need change.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.200
But both of these groups of people, Liz Truss and now

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.040
Donald Trump, seem to think that the way to fix the

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.880
economy is to lock a couple of geeks in a room

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.560
for a couple of weeks and ask them to rewrite the entire

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.600
economic system all by themselves and then to suddenly

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:51.000
foist some crazy, poorly implemented plan on the entire

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.680
world without any discussion and, I think it's

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.240
phenomenally immature way to do politics and economics.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.160
I mean, God knows how many Cambodians

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.920
would have died just to make it so that

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.720
poor Americans can't afford trainers.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.760
And I'm not saying that tariffs are a bad policy,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.400
but when are we going to wake up to the fact that

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.840
we have serious economic problems and we need

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.040
to have a discussion about this as a society?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.280
Why does it have to keep being crazy people with

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.800
crazy hair bringing up crazy policies that they seem

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.240
to have like, made up themselves a week earlier,

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.040
you know, in a little meeting with four people?

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.880
It drives me mad.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.080
Okay, so what happened after Donald Trump's

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.280
mood board tried to explode Cambodia?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.800
Financial markets went totally insane,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.520
stock markets started to sell off really, really

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.880
aggressively, and the reason for this is obvious.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.960
You've got companies like, Nike or, like

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.720
Apple, that build their products or... Yeah, they

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.320
build their products basically in poorer countries.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.000
Apple builds a lot of phones in China, but Nike

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.680
and a lot of cheap clothing manufacturers, build

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.040
their clothes in Bangladesh or Cambodia or Vietnam

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.440
and suddenly the cost of an iPhone was going to,

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.280
like, nearly double in the US or the cost of

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.600
cheap clothes would be increasing by 50%, 60%.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.560
And, you know, if you're selling cheap clothes

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.880
to poorer Americans they can't afford

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.800
to pay 50%, 60% and what would have happened is

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.960
the sales of things like iPhones, which might

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.000
still happen because the China... the China

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.240
tariffs are still on, would have collapsed.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.320
The sales of clothing would have

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.640
collapsed and, you know, you could have

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.600
seen the bankruptcy of companies like Nike.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.280
It's crazy to say but it is possible.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.760
Financial markets went totally, totally insane.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.440
They were freaking out.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.800
Now I traded through the COVID crisis,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.520
at home on my laptop, but I traded in

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.120
the 2008 crisis as a professional trader.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.360
In a lot of ways, markets, to me, felt crazier last

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.360
week than they did during the beginning of COVID or the

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.600
beginning of 2008 and I think the reason for that was,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.600
even in 2008, 2008 was really serious, you know,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.840
we were really talking about, like, a really

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.920
serious potential global economic depression.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.040
We knew that, at the very least, the governments

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.840
wanted to avoid a global economic depression.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.160
But in the last week, we didn't really know that.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.520
I don't, think any of us really

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.680
knew what the US government wanted.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.560
It seemed at points like they

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.720
wanted to make the stock market crash.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.680
It seemed at points like they wanted to

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.000
crash the global economy, and it was crazy.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.400
The markets were crazy.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.720
Stock markets collapsed.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.280
And to be hon- you know what,

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.720
again, what you see here again is another kind of

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.880
legitimate problem recognised but addressed in a mad

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.880
way, which is I think you do, and I speak about this

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.320
a lot, I think you do want assets, like housing,

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.240
like stocks, to be cheaper for ordinary people.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.160
I think you want wages... you want

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.840
assets to be cheaper relative to wages.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.600
But the way to do that, the sensible

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.560
way to do that, is to change your

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.640
distribution and drive wages up over time.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.880
I don't think anybody wants to make Nike go bankrupt.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.600
I don't think anybody... I don't think anybody

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.760
wants to destroy the pensions of pensioners.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.520
But last week, we didn't know for sure whether that was

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.040
what the government wanted, the US government wanted.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.600
And the markets were freaking out.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.040
Stock markets were collapsing.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.640
A lot of rich people were buying.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.360
I was buying, kind of on a reflex, to

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.240
be honest, more than anything else.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.200
Trump seemed happy with that.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.000
Trump seems happy with the markets collapsing.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.320
On Monday, there was a rumor from some

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.480
random dickhead called Financial Juice... I

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.920
shouldn't say that, he might be a nice guy.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.760
From a random guy called Financial Juice,

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.960
said that they're going to pause the tariffs.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.880
Stock markets jumped up immediately.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.320
The White House immediately denied it.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.720
Stock markets jumped like up and

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.920
down like 10% in about 15 minutes.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.360
The White House denied it, they said, "We're not

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.720
going to do any pauses." To be honest, I thought

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.440
there's no way, at the very least, you... The

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.080
attacks on Southeast Asia, and they're the poorest countries in

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.200
the world, are totally not in the interest of anyone.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.720
I thought they had to turn back on that.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.920
But they were adamant they were

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.200
not going to turn back on that.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:33.000
And then we had, I think it was Tuesday evening,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.360
yeah, we started to see government

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.200
bonds sell off, especially in the US.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.480
What this means is... So this is interesting, right,

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.040
and this is something I talk about a lot, right,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.080
so I was an interest rate trader.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.040
In general, when the economy is very weak, you

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.400
expect central banks to cut interest rates.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.080
So you expect the interest rates to fall, it

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.200
should make borrowing costs cheaper, it should

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.600
make borrowing costs cheaper for the government.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.000
But what was happening in the last week was quite

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.200
interesting because if you raise tariffs,

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.480
that will increase prices significantly in the US.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.520
So it's going to increase inflation significantly in the

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.400
US, which puts the US government in a situation of...

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.440
It puts the US Federal Reserve, the

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.440
Central Bank in the US in a situation of, "Well,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.240
maybe we shouldn't cut interest rates because inflation

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.880
is really, really high." And then you're facing this

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.200
potential like double whammy of inflation going up...

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.720
well, triple whammy of inflation going up, you're

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.200
potentially causing a global economic depression,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.800
and interest rates going up at the same time.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.480
Still, the US government seem not to care, which meant

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.440
that traders were increasingly worrying that maybe they

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.840
were intentionally going to blow the economy up, maybe,

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.840
maybe they were planning not to pay the debt back.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.560
Really, like lots of questions were being asked.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.640
The things that they were doing seemed so crazy

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.800
that basically people were talking about maybe

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.640
they're going to confiscate other countries' gold,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.240
maybe they're not going to pay the debt back.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.320
A lot of the debt is owned by America to China.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.040
Maybe they're intentionally

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.360
not going to pay the debt back.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.200
So people started to sell US government bonds.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.560
I don't have any US government bonds, but if

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.600
I had them, I probably would have sold them.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.320
I wouldn't want to be owed money

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.680
by the US government now, like. Would you?

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.600
So basically, people started to sell

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.680
US government bonds, which means

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.840
the US government is in enormous amount of debt.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.840
If that had have continued, it could have meant, if

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.400
it had gotten out of control, similarly to the Liz Truss

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.120
situation, it could have led to the relatively

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.960
short term bankruptcy of the US government, and

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.800
that would have made 2008 look like a walk in the park.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.400
I'm laughing but this is what happened.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.440
This is what happened last week, and

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.080
thank **** they decided to back down because

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.680
honestly this could've gone anywhere.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.000
But then the way they back... even

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
the way they backed down, oh my God.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.120
We are filming this on Thursday, Trump tweeted

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.640
on Wednesday on ******* Truth Social, "Today's

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.360
a great day to buy stocks." And then a couple

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.520
hours later, he reverses the tariffs.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.360
Backs down on everything he did except for

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.880
the tariffs on China, which have gone up.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.200
And obviously stock markets went through the roof.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.680
So basically like Donald Trump is like

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:22.360
manipulating markets on social media.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.240
Yeah, basically it was mad times.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.560
Mad times for everyone.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.160
Um, uh, Lots of people will have lost a lot of money.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.960
Richer people like me who had the money to reach

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.200
at, will have been buying stocks throughout.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.520
I didn't buy stocks on the back of

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.240
Trump's tweet because I didn't see it.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.600
If I'd have seen it, I probably ******* would have!

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.400
This... The last concept which I'm

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.200
going to introduce in this video before I'm going to take

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.760
some questions from Jack, because I'm sure... I can't

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.520
cover everything because this is totally insane,

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.240
is a concept which I used to like during trading, final

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.480
concept of the video, called bias against inaction.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.560
Which is, there's this theory, I don't know if

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.120
it's true, that in football, soccer for my American

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.520
viewers, during a penalty shootout, the statistically

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.880
best thing for a goalie to do is to stay in the middle.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.280
Because if the penalty goes in the corner,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.120
you can't save it anyway, but if it's near the

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.120
middle, you'll save it by staying in the middle.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.720
But goalies very rarely stay in the middle because it

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:23.120
looks stupid, and basically whenever there's like a mad

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.560
crisis, traders, and I don't think just traders,

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.760
I'm talking from back in my time when I was a trader,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.960
they feel that they have to do something because if

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.400
you... if there's a crisis and you don't do anything,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.520
everybody thinks you're an idiot. But the truth is,

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.880
when something crazy happens, like what happened

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.960
last week, you don't know, you don't understand

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.280
in the first moment what has happened.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.360
And it doesn't make sense to take some dramatic action

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.360
or to respond in some dramatic way when something

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.200
crazy happens and you don't know what's happened.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.640
And whenever I was a trader and there was a big

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.880
crisis, occasionally in the initial move you lose

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.840
money and people would ask me, "What are you going to

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.960
do?" And I always said, "I'm not going to do anything

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.560
until I understand what the ****'s happening."

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:18.680
And I think this is a good example because

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.400
this is an ongoing situation.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.080
Tariffs are still there on China.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.280
Technically the tariffs on the rest of the world

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.040
are supposed to be reintroduced in 90 days, although

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.600
I strongly suspect that won't happen, because

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.760
I don't think Trump and his team had expected the

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.040
potentially cataclysmic results which they saw.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.800
But at the end of the day, all of this mad **** show

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.240
and most financial markets are pretty much back the

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.880
way they were last week because he turned

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.720
around and canceled a lot of the things that he did.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.560
And I think this really emphasises a lot of what

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.200
I've been saying since the beginning with Trump,

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.040
which is you need... Most of the time you're best off

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.000
not listening to what he says, because a lot of

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.720
what he says is designed to stress you out, to

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.840
panic you, and cause chaos, and to destabilise you.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.480
Don't be panicked into action.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.720
Stay calm, stay cool.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.360
Have sensible investments.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.240
Don't do anything crazy.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.640
Be aware that tariffs are regressive tax.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.440
Tariff's not necessarily a bad tax, but if they're

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.560
brought in without any support from the poor,

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.320
then it will impoverish the poor.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.160
If you are an American and you are not a rich American,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.560
you don't need to be opposed to tariffs,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.960
but you need to make sure that they are

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.040
not being used to benefit only the richest.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.200
I think what you are seeing here is the rich

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.080
Americans trying to squeeze out rich foreigners at the

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.120
expense of both poor Americans and poor foreigners.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.080
Protect your interests, stand together.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.640
Listen, the rich are protecting the rich.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.200
They're sending out tweets on Truth Social

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.280
helping each other to manipulate markets.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.160
Rich people bought a lot of stocks in the last week.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.440
I bought a lot of stocks.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.200
Trump supporters bought a lot of stocks.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.880
They don't buy them from nowhere.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.840
Somebody's being squeezed out.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.920
That's probably you.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.120
Don't panic.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.160
Stand together.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.760
I'm ******* knackered, but I'll do my best

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.360
to help keep you informed with what's going on.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.200
And, before we finish, we're

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.560
going to take some questions from Jack.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.000
You got any questions?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.160
Well, I was just wondering what like

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.840
what's going to happen next because

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.720
is this a big knock of confidence? Yes, yes.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:25.960
Sorry.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.680
We should talk about that.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.000
Yeah.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.600
So what, what's going to happen next?

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.920
Even though a lot of the tariffs have been canceled,

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.000
first of all, the tariff on China is still there.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.040
They might reach a deal on that.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.160
Assuming they don't reach a deal on that, China's

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.920
a ******* massive country, exports a lot to the US.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.480
It will s- You'll see certain things,

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.400
you know, iPhones, but not just iPhones,

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.240
like, China makes a lot of stuff.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.920
You'll see those prices increase in the US.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.240
You will.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.720
It won't be nearly as much as what would have

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.800
happened if they'd kept the tariffs on everyone.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.000
Certain prices will increase on the US for sure.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.760
And as I've said, tariffs are a regressive tax.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.520
So like for me, as a rich person, if the price of an

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.560
iPhone doubles, like I didn't even really notice that.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.000
You know what I mean?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.920
But it's not just iPhones.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.560
Cheaper phones.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.040
You know, phone is an essential.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.200
You know, it's manufactured goods.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.440
They make basically everything.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.880
You know, manufactured goods, pretty much

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.080
your furniture, your fridge, your oven.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.600
You know what I mean?

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.120
Like, how much in this room

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.360
was, was probably made in China?

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.840
The microwave, this, like,

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.400
almost everything basically.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.400
So, like, yeah, the cost of manufactured

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.120
goods will go up in America.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.880
I should say like it's... The position of like the

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.360
Europe or the UK is quite interesting because in

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.040
theory if the US alone does tariffs, prices in the

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.320
US go up, they import less from China, and China

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.280
has suddenly loads of goods it needs to export.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.320
You could see prices of things go down in the

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.160
UK and Europe, which could be good in a

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.920
weird way for your average British or European.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.280
But of course European and British governments

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.120
will have to protect... If it's the case of

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.080
these are products which will directly compete with

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.000
existing industries in the UK, then our government

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
will probably have to put its own tariffs on.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.600
Because if you suddenly get tons of cheap imports,

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.400
it could see British factories shutting down.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.200
But the truth is Britain doesn't

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.880
have that many factories anymore.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.080
It's probably not in direct competition

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.520
with China in certain products.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.040
So in theory, you could see things get cheaper

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.960
in the UK and you could see interest rates fall.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.480
One thing that was really worrying, I'm almost

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.920
hesitant to mention it, was you saw suddenly

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.400
interest rates in specifically the UK really

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.720
rise and government bond rates really rise.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.480
And of course we've seen that increase in

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.920
government borrowing costs driving austerity.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.480
That was really ******* worrying.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.400
A lot of people are saying, "Don't worry about it,

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.720
markets were just freaking out." But, as

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.080
a British person, I'm worried about it.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:51.920
They might back down.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.280
Listen, I'm not against tariffs,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.920
but this is not a way to do tariffs.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.880
This is not a way to do policy, you know.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.760
This just feels like four or five

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.520
crazy guys in a room made this policy,

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.680
like. If we want to have... We can have a

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.040
discussion about ta- it's the same as when

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.880
I talk about taxing the rich, you know.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.400
I'm not trying to be that crazy guy

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.600
in the room making the whole policy.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.800
What I want is to have a societal discussion about

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.160
a problem and come to a place about fixing it.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.520
The second thing is, who the ****

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.600
is going to build a factory in the US now?

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.360
Realistically.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.600
Like, would you build a factory in the U- like...

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.440
It doe- like, I would be worried that they'll

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.680
******* just, like, expropriate the factory.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.320
These guys seem crazy.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.920
But the third thing is, and, you know, I'm not

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.760
like a defense expert, but like, what does

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.440
Japan do now? What do you do if you're Japan?

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.640
Japan, like, has been, like, basically,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.680
like, a, like, a really unbelievably

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.520
tight US ally for, whatever, 70 years now.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.080
80 years.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.280
You know, the US Army's massively based in Japan,

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.840
and then the US turns round and basically, like,

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.160
seriously threatens to ******* destroy your economy.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.040
What the **** are you going to do?

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.000
Japan, okay, I'm not telling Japan what to do.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.200
It looks to me like they

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.200
have no option but to re-arm.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.840
That's crazy, right?

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.560
But, you know, Japan, South Korea, I mean, Taiwan

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.360
probably has no defense if the US doesn't back it.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.240
But like, you know, okay, so

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.800
you're telling Japan to re-arm.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.440
You're telling South Korea to re-arm.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.320
You're telling the whole of

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.760
Southeast Asia to ally with China.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.280
Like, what... If you're Cambodia, what do you do?

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.960
If you're Cambodia, the consequences in Cambodia,

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.800
you know, and I know Cambodia's a small faraway

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.720
country, but that would have been unbelievable...

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.600
And not, you know, Cambodia, and Laos, Bangladesh, Vietnam.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.000
These guys who have built economies completely

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
fundamentally attached to the US have no choice but

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.640
to reorient their economies to be with China now.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.240
This is insane.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.720
This is like you are trying to cre-... If you

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.640
tell Japan to re-arm, you tell Europe to re-arm,

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.080
you are telling the world, "I want a world war."

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.280
And at the same time, you are telling some key

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.680
strategic allies to not be on your side in that war.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.280
Like, I, it's...

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:07.760
You know what,

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.160
this is a weird analogy, right?

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.640
But you know what it makes me think of?

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.800
Do you remember Fyre Festival?

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.080
Yes.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.640
Fyre Festival, for those who don't know, is this

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.000
American festival where they had this really

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.920
sick marketing campaign with loads of models.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.240
They were like, "We're going to have this unbelievably...

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.040
unbelievable festival on a island." The

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.280
marketing campaign was so good, they spent all

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.000
of their time working on the marketing campaign.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.720
Nobody actually figured out what

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.080
to do with the ******* festival.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.280
So all these people bought these tickets,

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.160
they turned up, there was no ******* festival.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.400
It kind of feels like that because raising

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.760
tariffs to cut income tax is ******* sexy comms.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.280
It's sexy ******* comms.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.080
Like, that sounds great.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.840
But you look at the policy, you're trying to...

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.000
The results of the policy are to crush the

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.680
poor in Cambodia, to crush the poor in America,

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.720
to create a world war that you're going to lose.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.920
It's insane policy, but it's sexy comms.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.520
And I just feel like we're turning the whole

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.800
world into Fyre Festival, which is just like,

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.600
"I don't give a **** because this guy's

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.360
only going to be president for four years.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.400
He just wants to have sexy comms." And I hope, you

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.760
know... And, and I have these arguments all the time

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.320
saying, "I think it's incompetence." And I'm not

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.040
s-... And I just want to be clear, I don't think this

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.760
incompetence is just Trump, you know, and I don't

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.160
think it's even just the US administration.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.880
I think all of the smart guys are *******

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.840
traders at investment banks and the

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.400
governments are run by idiots, you know.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.560
And this is why I... This is why I'm on YouTube,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.960
because I'm... The people who are going to get

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.960
hurt... Donald Trump's not going to get hurt.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.520
I bet... Donald Trump made a ****

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.160
tonne of money last week, I bet you.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.720
And not just him, his whole team, you know.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.560
This is ordinary working Americans.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.080
These is ordinary working Americans,

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.160
ordinary working Europeans.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.200
And this is why I've got a YouTube

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.360
that talks to ordinary people.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.840
So I know I just said what the consequences are.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.920
And maybe, you know, I'm sitting here in

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.360
the immediate aftermath of this and maybe in

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.560
two, three weeks time, things look calmer.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.360
I'll be on a ******* beach hopefully.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.000
It's worrying.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.560
But I think to finish, we need to

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.680
let people know... I'm going to take a bit of

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.600
time off soon because I'm ******* knackered.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.040
I'm going to keep doing this in the long run.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.600
We're going to provide people with the information

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.280
they need, the understanding that they need.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.160
What we're doing here is

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.600
building and growing unbelievably quickly.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.720
I'm not saying I'm going to ******* save the world,

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.920
but what that does show is that there is demand

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.120
in the UK, in America, in Europe, Australia, Canada.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.720
Canadians keep messaging me, "Why you never say Canada?"

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.080
Across the world, we see the demographics.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080
People across the world want

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.000
this, want something different.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.360
we're going to try building it.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.320
But it's not just going to be me.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.440
It's not just going to be us.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.520
There is demand for something different,

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.480
something not insane, something not destabilising.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.640
And it doesn't mean, you know,

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.240
that you can't reduce the trade balance.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.000
It doesn't mean you can't

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.720
protect American working people.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.640
But this, what is happening

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.280
now, is not protecting anyone.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.080
It's not protecting anyone.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.240
And the book's been number one for ten

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.000
weeks, so we'll finish on some good news.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.920
But that's it.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.280
I think we'll end it there.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.240
Sorry for another stressful video.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.880
I think we're only going to... I am *******

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.840
knackered and, the Daily Mail keeps knocking

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.440
on my mum's house and it's stressing me out.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.360
So probably another two weeks, I'll

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.880
go on holiday, but we're still here.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.800
Don't go mad.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.560
Stay cool.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.720
Educate your friends.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.480
Send this video to your mum, to your community.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.720
Let's build something better.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.720
Doesn't have to be ******* mental all the time.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.520
Good luck.
