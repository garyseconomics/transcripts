00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.500
*so again the economy is doing well but 
'we'&nbsp;are not, is it conversely possible for*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.460
*us to do well yeah for the economy to falter?* 
I&nbsp;mean in a sense it's a question on semantics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.220
and a question on linguistics, I personally&nbsp;
think that a good economy is people's lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
being good, I think that's... you know I don't&nbsp;
think... I think they are the same thing but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.800
you can definitely have a situation where GDP is&nbsp;
rising and people's lives are getting worse 100%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.360
you can have that and I think that is I mean GDP&nbsp;
now is much higher than it was 50-60 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.080
but in many ways people's lives are worse&nbsp;than
they were 60 years ago; they work longer hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.840
they have much less leisure time, in many 
cases&nbsp;they're squeezed into smaller housing,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260
they're much more financially insecure; some things 
have&nbsp;gotten better of course you know there's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.880
technological advancements you know holidays&nbsp;
to Asia are cheaper and a lot of white goods are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.860
cheaper you know obviously we have computing 
power&nbsp;we didn't have back then but you know in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.580
of financial security you know I look at my dad with&nbsp;
no advanced education and you know god bless you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.400
dad no particular marketable skills, he was able to&nbsp;
buy a house and raise a family you know nowadays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
you have people who are homeless doing that kind&nbsp;
of job you know what I mean you know so I think in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.720
many ways life has gone worse so I always remember&nbsp;
there was um a great moment in the brexit debate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
where I think it was George Osborne was on I&nbsp;
don't know Question Time saying 'if we leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.560
the EU GDP is going to go down' I don't know 4.7%&nbsp;
or whatever and some woman stood up in the crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.300
and she shouted 'that's your GDP' and um I f***in
loved it I thought it was amazing this is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.120
such a powerful statement for the reclamation of&nbsp;
economics and economic ideas for the f***ing people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.700
who gives a f*** if GDP is going up if life is&nbsp;
getting worse and worse for the majority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.280
of the people, it doesn't f***in matter does&nbsp;it? 
it doesn't f***in matter so um I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.060
because economists tend to focus on very narrow&nbsp;
metrics you know if you look at the last 20 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.940
okay maybe not the last two years but before&nbsp;
that; growing GDP, low unemployment, low steady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.100
inflation; in the eyes of most economists that&nbsp;
is a good economy okay maybe it's not excellent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.640
economy but it's a good economy but if you look&nbsp;
actually what's happening to ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.740
harder to get a well-paying job, harder to be&nbsp;
able to support a family, longer working hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.800
much harder to afford housing, so many parts&nbsp;
of this country and and this continent and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.680
the world which used to be able to house good&nbsp;
reliable jobs for families you can't even live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.220
there anymore it's hard to get a job you know what&nbsp;
I mean? yes it's not working for ordinary people but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.780
um yeah it's it's to focus just on GDP is a&nbsp;
madness and I think I think um you need to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
you know (Thomas) Kane said that to be a&nbsp;
good economist requires a great variety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.040
of skills and I think yeah you need to be able&nbsp;
to look at GDP and understand it but it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.000
one measure and if GDP is going up and life is&nbsp;
getting worse then who the f*** really cares

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.400
*so I mean like it is a case of&nbsp;semantics and 
how you phrase it but&nbsp;if the problem is that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.080
in the public&nbsp;sector we're not very good at finding&nbsp;
out the good economists and rewarding&nbsp;them 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080
but in the private sector they are 
how do they identify good economists?*

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000
predictors! predictors! 
well in markets it's just...

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.680
you set them out you compete against one&nbsp;
another and who's the guy who's getting them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.420
making the predictions right? who is the guy...&nbsp;
that's why I'm so focused on... *what GDP?*

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.400
it could be anything it could be anything so you&nbsp;
know I was specifically and it's it's not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.740
that your predictions are right what they look for&nbsp;
what markets effectively reward is people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:00.900
very good uh making predictions that are right and&nbsp;
everybody thought they were wrong so if everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.220
knows something's going to happen you don't&nbsp;
make no money betting on it so my big trade was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.240
back in sort of early 2011 I said interest rates&nbsp;
will be zero for f***in five years nobody thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.700
that back then, nobody thought that back then, 
but&nbsp;I could see ordinary people are getting f***ed&nbsp;

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.660
here and you're never going to have a recovery if&nbsp;
people don't have any f***in money to spend you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:29.100
know what I mean and um it wasn't that complicated&nbsp;
really but nobody could see that nobody could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.380
see that and I think what you have there is&nbsp;
another big problem in economics which is that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.340
top level economists either ones that come from&nbsp;
prestigious universities and get the prestigious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.520
jobs overwhelmingly living lives where they are&nbsp;
from elite universities, elite private schools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.600
rich families.. everybody I know is from that&nbsp;
background and they have no f***in idea what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.060
happening in the real world they've got no f***in&nbsp;
idea so you have this whole world of economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.220
where nobody knows what's f***in happening&nbsp;
in their lives of ordinary people with regards..&nbsp;

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.880
it is crazy it is.. this is.. It's.. and you&nbsp;know 
you look at it and it's sometimes it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.640
profoundly depressing I think you have to look for&nbsp;
the humour in it in a way you know you look at these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.260
guys like George Osborne and like Andrew Bailey and 
you&nbsp;know they look so smart in their suits they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.540
know what the f*** they're doing they do not&nbsp;
know what the f*** and the worst of it is they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.840
don't even know they don't know that's how bad&nbsp;
they are that is seriously this and and nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.280
no good trader in the city gives a f*** about them&nbsp;
they know we know that they're a bunch of idiots

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:48.300
*scary* it's scary but you know you got me you&nbsp;
got me you know you you know you won't find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.840
many who have a better understanding *in many ways&nbsp;
though and I'm sure maybe viewers would share this..*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:05.040
*I wonder if maybe not having you would be better&nbsp;
 ignorance is bliss* no no I don't I don't believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.340
I don't believe ignorance is bliss I think that&nbsp;
there is a profound strength and dignity that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.720
comes from working hard to understand the&nbsp;
situation that you are in even if it is bad
