00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Okay you good? Yeah

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.160
I'm gonna do this one to you alright

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.240
Alright so I wanna do one called ‘Forget About Money’

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.640
Really the idea behind this is people

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.360
when they think about the economy

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.760
they very often tend to think about it in terms of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.640
money and it stops them from

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.840
really understanding how the economy works

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.200
and understanding that really

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.160
the economy is about real things

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.680
real resources, real people doing real work 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.040
and I call this 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.080
like money obsession, or money centrism and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400
you see this everywhere

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.880
and it's not just from ordinary people

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.480
you also see this from economists

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
so a good example of this is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.960
when we had the 2008 financial crisis

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.000
that led to a massive upward redistribution of wealth

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.560
and how did we deal with it?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.520
Slashing interest rates to zero

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.800
which is monetary policy doing something with money

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.600
printing money and quantitative easing, again

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
monetary policy, printing money.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
Covid, massive economic crisis

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.040
massive upward redistribution of wealth

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.920
what did we do?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.200
Slash rates to zero, quantitative easing

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480
print money, so really... and you know

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.760
these are the economists that run our our countries

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.840
they run our economies when there are crises

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.080
even crises

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.640
that involve massive redistribution of real resources

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.520
they focus on money centric solutions

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.080
and they totally ignore what has happened

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.120
with real resources

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.400
and then you know

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.960
we can obviously see now that the way that

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.240
those two crises were managed

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.440
has led to falling living standards

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480
and I've been aware of this for a long time

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.040
and I've been critical of this for a long time

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.360
and I've been arguing about

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360
this for a long time

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.320
but when I argue with people about this

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.400
very often, regardless of whether they are on the right

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.120
or the left

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.640
or the centre of the political economic spectrum

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.840
whatever you like, they tend to say: ‘No

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120
the problem is not real resources

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.280
the problem is money’

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.720
so I always remember

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.240
I did this Masters at Oxford 2017 to 2019

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.560
and you’re with a lot of like classic

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.920
classic economists

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.800
you know modern elite trained economists

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040
and you know, I was saying, you know

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.120
the problem is massive upward redistribution of wealth

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.960
you know wealth is being lost by governments

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.040
and the middle class is, same stuff I always say

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.160
and this guy said no

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.280
no no

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040
the problem is just that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800
we didn't cut interest rates far enough

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.520
this is a nice guy by the way

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.640
like I would consider him a friend

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.880
you know he's not an idiot

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.920
he's a smart guy

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.240
classically trained elite economist

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.480
and I'm like, ‘dude like we cut interest rates to zero!’

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.440
He's like, ‘no

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.040
we should have cut interest rates to minus three %’

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.720
and it's like

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.520
his criticism is we just didn't cut rates

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.160
far down enough and I don't know if you ever saw

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.960
the interview I did with the IEA

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.120
so the IEA for those who don't know is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.240
it's a very right wing economic think tank

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.440
and I went and did an interview

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.920
on their channel years ago

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.160
when I was a lot less well known

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.120
it's worth watching to be honest quite funny 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.360
and I went on there against, is it Mark Littlewood?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.920
What is his name?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.560
And he was very respectful but 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.480
he came out and this is quite funny

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000
when you consider the story I just told

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.680
he said the problem is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.800
we shouldn't have cut interest rates to zero

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.320
we should have kept them at 3, 4%

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.240
so, and you know, at the time I was there

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.720
it was quite funny because we could

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.160
we could already see at the time

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800
that interest rates were gonna come back up

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.960
because it was, this was like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.560
when inflation was starting to come through

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.320
and I was like, ‘dude

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.480
you're telling me you think if rates go back to 3

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.120
4% that's gonna fix the problem?’

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.160
and he was like yeah and I was like

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.840
‘well you are gonna see very shortly

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.760
that that is not gonna fix the problem’, basically

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.400
but I think this is really interesting right

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.840
that you have this economic context in which

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320
every problem is dealt with

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.960
by fiddling around with money, printing money

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.760
giving out money

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.280
printing out money and that clearly doesn't work

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.720
you know in the aftermath of 2008

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.000
I talk about this a lot

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.520
that cutting rates to zero was considered a super

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520
unusual, extreme, emergency policy

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.480
and everybody

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.440
thought it would have this really powerful

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.720
economic rebound effect, same in Covid

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.320
by the way

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.760
so everybody thought these massive moves

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.320
in money would have these massive real effects

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.760
and they just didn't have the effects

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.960
that were predicted, right

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.120
so even though we are now, we're like 15 years on

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.680
more than 15 years on from 2008

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.400
the lesson

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.800
and in a context of academic economists

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.120
basically being fixated on

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920
the way to fix every problem is money

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.840
the last 17 years should really have shown us

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.800
economists have overestimated 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.040
the power of money

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800
specifically and monetary policy

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.760
that should be obvious and yet even within that context

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.720
the main criticisms of the policy are that

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.880
are not that there was an

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.320
excessive focus on monetary policy

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.960
but on the one side, rates should have been cut further

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.400
and on the other side, rates shouldn't have been cut

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.640
there's money centrism from the establishment

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.520
which is failing

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.120
and there is money centrism from the critics

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.840
on both sides of the political spectrum

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.040
like it's just an absolute inability

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.480
to view the f***ing real resources

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.280
and all the time that that is happening

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.480
that the sense that the establishment

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.040
and the left and the right are all fixating on money

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.840
that wealth distribution is just going out of control

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.280
so you'll see like

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.360
money money money money money money money money money

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.600
money money money money money

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.280
no one is looking at real resources

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.320
and at the same time

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.080
government wealth is f***ing collapsing

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.200
so you're just like losing

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.280
you're losing your real resources

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.560
and all you're talking about is money

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.200
money money

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.680
money money

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.640
money and 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.880
I'm gonna wind in here like 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.240
because I'm trying to get more medieval history

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.800
into this, let's put like some bits here

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.640
so if you wanna skip the medieval history part

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.640
there was this...

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.520
there was this, so there's this idea in like 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.400
Abrahamic religion. Christianity

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.480
Judaism, Islam

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.040
it's one of the 10 Commandments

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.640
you should not worship graven images

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.520
and it led to this

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.080
which means you shouldn't worship images of god

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.400
and it led to this like

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.600
big discussion of whether you should

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.280
be allowed to make a statue of god

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.800
or draw a picture of god

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880
and this is why to this day in Islam

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.360
you can't have a picture of god

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.320
and there were wars in Greece

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.680
in the 8th century and 9th century

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.600
people are killing each other

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.120
over whether you should have a picture of god

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.600
and it was because you know

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.120
people worried that if you make a picture of God

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.160
people will confuse it for actual God

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.600
and I think what you're seeing here is people

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.240
have confused money for real resources

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.840
and I think I think we live in an age where like

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.440
money is kind of the new religion

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.640
and people confuse money for real resources

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640
and this is like

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.560
this confusion really prevents people from seeing

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.960
you know

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.400
seeing the forest in front of their eyes basically

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.680
because all they think about is money

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680
they don't think about real resources

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.280
so you see these amazing things happen

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.720
which is monetary policy fails to deal with the crisis

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.880
real resource distribution collapses

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.000
nobody notices the best example of this is Covid

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.280
so Covid, we knew

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.160
and obviously I’ve talked about this a million times

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160
we knew

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.840
the government was gonna give a trillion pounds out

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.520
which it did, trillion pounds, f***ng lot of money right

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.920
20 grand per person, US numbers even bigger, and 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.920
when that happens, when you know

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.480
tons of money is given out

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.600
and there's been no change in

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.080
what's happened to real resources

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.440
you should know distribution is gonna change

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.960
probably inflation crisis

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.720
probably a big increase in asset prices

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.640
it should be obvious right

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.120
cause you printed tons of money

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.840
you haven't done anything to real resources

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.160
but what was the media actually saying

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.960
the media was saying, ‘oh my God

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.000
people have got so much money now

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.800
we're gonna have such an economic boom when we reopen’

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.960
like how idiotic is that?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.160
But this is like

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.200
it's like, you must have had this conversation

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.520
when you were a kid at some point where

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.640
where you or somebody says hey

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.280
like why don't we just make more money?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.400
Why don't we just print more money?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.600
Give everybody more money

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.760
why don't we just do that?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.480
Or there's this US film called 

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.360
Idiocracy where 

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.560
is it Terry Crews that like really hench Black actor

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.440
you know the guy? 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.880
And he tried to become president and he's like

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.960
we're gonna be billionaires, and he's just like

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.400
we're just gonna give everyone a billion dollars

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.040
and it's like

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.440
it's basically what we did during Covid right

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.760
we print all this money, we give all this money out

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.360
nothing could have been more obvious than

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.880
that was gonna be an inflation crisis

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.600
and a massive increase in asset prices

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.960
and I made tons of money betting on these things

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.520
and I spoke about these things happening

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.120
and yet the media narrative at the time was

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.880
we’re just gonna have an economic boom

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.320
because everybody's got so much money

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.120
and that is again

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.520
just like this really idiotic money obsession

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.120
and it always reminds me of this

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.280
understanding that they had in medieval Europe

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280
which is if you make too many

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.520
if you make pictures of God

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.560
people are gonna confuse it for actual God, you know

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.200
money is not and I've said it before

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.320
money is not real resources

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.360
money is not real resources

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.880
but this confusion between money and real resources

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.600
causes so

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.920
many problems and 

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.600
it's connected to the current

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.600
I believe

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.120
quite naive Labour economic policy of just build build

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.760
build, grow grow grow

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.680
and this idea is kind of based... and

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.400
they're even trying to do things like

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.640
they're trying to convince

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.240
ordinary people to not hold their savings in cash

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.440
but to buy stocks and shares

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.400
and they think it's gonna grow the economy, like it's...

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.880
I can't explain to you how idiotic this is, right

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.520
if you think that the only thing that matters is money

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.160
then what you see is oh my God

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.640
people that just have money sitting in their accounts

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.600
it's just being wasted, like

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.400
let's get them to invest the money

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.280
and the economy is gonna grow, right

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.880
money is just a system, it's a spreadsheet

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.320
like, it balances

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.560
it has... some people are in credit

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.440
some people are in debt

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.680
it has to balance out. If people wanna know about that

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.040
we can we can put in the description

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.800
our videos on money and our videos on debt

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.840
so you can understand that, like obviously

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.280
when the government printed and gave out money

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.560
people would accumulate money

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.000
that doesn't mean that you can just

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.200
suddenly have a load of investment

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.240
because if you want actual investment

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.720
what you need is to build more real resources, okay?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.040
it's not just about money

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.560
People might have money sitting in their accounts

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.360
but there are no unused real resources, okay?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.560
We don't live in a world now where there's like

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.240
a million guys who are unemployed

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.800
and there’s like a huge like land out there.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.720
Like there are times in history

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.600
where you kind of have unused resources

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.760
the best example probably is like the US

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.640
the European colonization of

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.840
of the US okay

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.360
so obviously there were Native Americans in the US

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.800
but the Native Americans were like basically driven out

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.200
they were like, there was a basically a genocide

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.760
they were all killed

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.760
and then you end up with like almost this empty land

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.400
empty land, and then you have

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.960
you know a lot of unemployed Europeans

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.240
and then it's, okay, we take the unemployed people

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.560
we send them to America

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.360
they expand into this infinite land

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.720
and you can just grow and grow and grow

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.560
when you have these unused resources

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.960
you can just grow like this

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.240
but the truth is we don't have

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.680
you know, we don't have like unused resources

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.000
we don't have loads of people who

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.280
don't have jobs, you know

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.440
all of the resources are used, right?

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.000
If you want, for example

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.480
to have more houses

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.680
then you need to take those resources

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.200
from somewhere else

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.880
we don't just have a ton of builders

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.320
and a ton of building materials

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.640
just sitting by the side of the road

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.880
to build the houses right

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.040
you need to deal with the question

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.480
of the distribution of real resources

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.560
and you see this all the time

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.720
we get people in the comments saying

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.160
oh ‘Gary Gary

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.440
Gary, you're talking about zero sum fallacy

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.440
we can always make more resources’. Okay...

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.200
how? Because at the moment everything is being used, okay?

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.200
If you want to build more resources

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.160
that's fine, somebody is going to have to consume

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.000
less for you to be able to do that building

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.160
because the resources have to come from somewhere

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.600
those builders that you need to build the houses

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.760
they are currently making f***ing kitchen extensions

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.640
and renovations for rich people's houses, okay?

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.080
So you need to somehow get the resources from them

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.680
you see what I'm saying

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.560
the obsession with money

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.480
leads to an Assumption that there are...

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.880
that we can just do things like building new housing

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.160
or growing the economy

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.760
without taking anything away from somebody

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.840
which you just f***ing can't because, obviously from the...

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.840
and it's, it's this

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.600
small minded attempt to extend

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720
the economy of the individual

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.680
to the country which is

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.040
if I am here

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.560
and I have half a million pounds or whatever

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.280
say I've got £2 million in my account

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.520
I can buy a plot of land and all the resources

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.640
and I can build a house

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.280
and what that is doing is I'm taking resources

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.320
I'm outbidding somebody else for those resources

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.000
so from the perspective of an individual

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.080
I have money I can build

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.360
I can create a thing, fine

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.560
in a society

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.680
where all of the resources are already used

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.000
you cannot simply grow that economy

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.080
build those houses

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.800
without taking those resources from somebody else

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.560
and what I am saying is

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.160
in an economy where you have this tiny group of people

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.600
who increasingly own all of the resources

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.080
all of the assets and have unbelievably

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.200
enormous amounts of luxury spending

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.160
we should be reducing their consumption

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.120
so we can grow the economy

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.600
and there's no other way to do it

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.880
there's no other way to do it, listen

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.680
in the short term it is a zero sum economy

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.360
you cannot suddenly grow the economy

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.640
you need to devote resources to growing the economy

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.800
and those resources need to come from somewhere

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.080
you do need to deal with the competitive nature

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080
and I think it's this money

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.800
centrism that allows people to forget

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.280
that the world is being used

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.920
there's no, you know, you cannot go into the wild

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.240
and f***ing chop down the trees

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.560
and build your own f***ing house anymore

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.400
like everything is owned, everything is owned

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.040
you cannot grow the economy

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.480
without getting the resources

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.040
from the guys who own the resources

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.560
the people who own the resources are the f***ing rich

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.120
either you tax the rich, or you don't get the growth

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.640
and you have this, you know

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.240
these very naive policies which is like

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.520
we're just gonna grow, we're gonna grow

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520
we're gonna borrow from the rich

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.480
and we're just gonna grow

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:33.760
you know

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.640
but the rich are only gonna lend to you at profit

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.480
so they are gonna take the growth

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.800
you know the growth is all gonna be for them you know

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.600
either you deal with this distribution

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.160
or you don't get the growth 

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.640
so, to conclude the video

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.720
money centrism gives the illusion

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.800
that we can grow at no cost to anybody

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.240
it is not true, we exist in a world of real resources

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.240
what really matters is the real resources

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.360
I would encourage people to go down the street

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.400
look at the buildings

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.160
look at the high streets, understand real resources

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.000
real people doing real jobs

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.120
making real things

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.480
and the distribution of those things matters

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.760
At the moment

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.560
real resources are being aggressively transferred

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.120
away from the middle class

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.920
and the working class

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.040
and the government towards the super rich

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.000
that will lead to a loss in the consumption

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.960
of the middle class

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.720
of the working class and of government services

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.440
assets are not sitting on the sidelines

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.200
assets are not money. What matters is real resources

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.120
what matters is real distribution

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.280
If you do not focus on

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.000
protecting your share of the distribution

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.320
I guarantee you

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.920
the people who have passive income of 1 million

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.760
£2 million a week will increase their share

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.680
over time, your share will decrease

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.160
money is not the only thing that matters

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.880
you need to protect your share of real resources

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.960
thank you.
