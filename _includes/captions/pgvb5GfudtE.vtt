00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.160
Okay.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm back.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.800
Okay, so I've been gone about four months.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
Thanks for waiting.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.520
Lots has happened.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.720
Today we're going to talk about where I've been,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.200
what I've been doing.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.240
The things that I've missed.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000
Mainly the two big elections

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
and what we're going to do for the channel this year.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.040
So we kept the videos going out on this channel

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.120
until about the end of August,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
but I actually went away, just before the end of June,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.840
which was just before the election here in the UK.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.720
And I went away

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.640
just before the election on

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.760
purpose, to be honest, because,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.120
it was very obvious before the election

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.360
that Labour would win.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.880
And Labour would win by quite a significant margin.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.120
And some people who watch this

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.800
channel and see me supporting

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240
wealth taxes and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960
increased tax on the rich and trying to reduce

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.000
inequality, might have assumed that I was

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.440
some big Labour supporter,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.000
but in reality, I think it was clear

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.160
and has been clear for quite a while,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.720
that it's very unlikely

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.440
Labour are going to do anything significant

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.920
on inequality or wealth tax or tax on the super rich.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.640
And for that reason,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600
the election was a little bit depressing for me,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.920
and I was getting quite down, to be honest

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.400
coming into the election.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.040
Because I'd been expecting the election

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.320
to be

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.600
in sort of November, it came in June,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.480
and I felt at the time like we're not

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.360
big enough to put any pressure on the government,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080
or the incoming government.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.000
They're not going to offer us anything.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.880
They're not going to give us anything.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.840
And it was just quite depressing to see

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.080
after sort of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.840
working really hard on this channel for a long time,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.160
that it's going to be another

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.320
five years, another government

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320
that are probably not going to give us anything.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.040
And I think in a sense

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.800
it was easier emotionally in a way,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.760
when we had these kind of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.440
comedy villains in charge of the country.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.360
You know,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.520
Rishi Sunak, son-in-law

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.240
of one of the richest men in the world,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.280
Boris Johnson,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.720
David Cameron, Liz Truss,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.800
George Osborne,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.280
these guys that look like bad guys in a Disney film.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.680
Because when you have these kind of...

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.000
kind of obvious villains in charge, it's very easy

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.400
to point the finger at these guys and say,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.720
these guys are the bad guys.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.200
Let's give these guys a good kicking.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320
Let's kick him out and then let's changed things.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.280
But the truth is, and it is obvious now

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.400
that the problem is and always was deeper than that.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
And it is made obvious

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.040
by the fact that the Labour government have come in.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160
And if you saw my video on the election before

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.280
I went away,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.880
I said very clearly in that video,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.040
we will get a new Labour government,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.360
they will get a big mandate,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.840
they'll get a big majority despite being unpopular.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.120
And they will fail on inequality,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.440
which means they will fail on the economy

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.560
and they will be very unpopular very quickly. And that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.920
at this point is kind of obviously true.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.160
What it makes clear is that the problem

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.560
is bigger than left or right.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.200
The problem is bigger than Labour or Conservative.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.240
We have a problem

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.320
in this country, but it is not only in this country.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320
And I think the situation in America

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960
and in many other countries proves

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.480
this problem goes way, way beyond just the UK.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.600
There is a problem of a broad consensus of economists,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.520
but also of these kind of semi idiotic

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.840
upper middle class, elite university

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360
academics and intellectuals and elites

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.800
that are simply very, very unwilling to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.400
even talk about inequality as part of the problem.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.560
And they want to talk about things like

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.360
economic growth and efficiency

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840
and increasing GDP and,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.040
pulling our socks up and all working a bit harder.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.920
All the while, wealth absolutely floods

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.640
to the rich and the super rich,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.760
and nobody seems to fix that problem.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.600
So yeah, it was a bit depressing going away.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.400
Well, it's a bit depressing seeing the election come in

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.360
and just knowing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.960
the problem is way bigger than one election.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.360
The problem is way bigger than just winning.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.000
We're just kicking a party out of government.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.200
It's very easy to kick a party out of government,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.600
but it's much harder to fix a problem.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.440
So

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.760
I went away to sort of sit down and have a think about

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.320
what can we do, what can we do to... to fight this?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.480
Because the truth is, we are going to have five years

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.160
of Labour government now, and I hope I'm wrong on this.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.480
And I want to make it clear

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.960
before I say what I was about to say.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.840
I don't think that

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.280
the Labour government is full of corrupt villains.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.320
There's probably one or two in there.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.400
Some of these guys want to do the best thing

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.160
for their country.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.480
And, despite that, the fact is

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.920
I really don’t

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.520
think we're going to get anything from them.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.080
So what do we do? What can we do?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.440
What do you do when you live in a two party

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.680
political system,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.800
and both parties

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.440
are absolutely incapable of recognising

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.840
an enormous

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.520
gaping hole

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.640
in the bottom of the economy

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.560
that just grows and grows day after day.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.640
And that's what I went away to think about basically,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.440
what can we do?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.920
What can I do?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.480
What can you do?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.960
And also, to be honest, just to like

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.920
get a bit of a rest. It's been a bad year.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.720
Like the growth of the channel has been insane.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.320
I get recognised like 6 or 7 times a day.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.560
I get like tons of emails from loads of people.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.080
People who want to help, people

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.720
who want to like, work for us.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.760
People who want to do stuff.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.680
And,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.560
I get so many messages that it's impossible

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.280
for me to basically read all the messages and,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.160
you know, people stop me in the street

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.240
and they say, you know,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.400
we're counting on you to do something.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.840
You know, we believe you can do something.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.760
And it's hard when people say that

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.640
when you know, my like,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.240
honest assessment of the situation is

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.520
it's just going to get worse.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.040
So I needed to take a bit of time away,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.200
basically to figure out like, well, what can we do?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.280
Can we do anything? Just clear my head basically.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.640
But now we're back.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.160
We're going to be back with weekly videos,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.440
and we are going to try,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.960
whether we succeed or not I don't know,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.800
we're going to try to get into a situation

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.160
where we could change things.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.200
And the channel is growing a lot,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.760
which genuinely gives us

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.800
a little bit of political power. But it's not enough.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.360
The truth is, if we want to really impact change here,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.440
we need to be bigger.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.760
And this is the kind of thing

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.720
which I've been rolling around in my head,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.000
because the truth is,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.520
like even

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.160
the level of kind of

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.200
fame and scrutiny and attention that I get

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.640
now sometimes makes me uncomfortable.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.120
But if we want to have a political impact

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.960
and we want to stop this from getting worse and worse,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.880
we need to be much bigger.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.600
We need to be much bigger,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.720
the channels needs to be much bigger.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.080
So I honestly think

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.480
there is a massive

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.600
gap in our media for just communicating economics

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.120
in an ordinary,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.840
simple, plain speaking, understandable way

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.680
to ordinary people.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.080
I think that 80, 90% of people in this country

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.440
don't have any economic communicator

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.760
that is communicating to them on the news

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.560
what's happening in a way they understand.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.880
Never mind the way

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.160
that is like welcoming and accessible.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.320
And I think in a world where the economy

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.720
has gotten massively worse

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.360
and will continue

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.800
to get worse, and living standards

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.840
will continue to get worse for ordinary people,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.640
and there is continuing financial insecurity.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.720
People want that.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.720
People want somebody who can explain what's happening

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.040
in a way that is clear

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.640
and in a way that makes sense to them.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.400
And I think that is the reason

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.240
why the channel has grown so much with,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.560
you know, with very few people working on it.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.440
We've never had

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.840
even a single member of full time

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.320
staff on this channel,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.840
full time paid staff is including me.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.560
With no full time

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.120
paid staff with very, very little funding,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.200
we've managed to build this channel

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.320
up to more than half a million subs now, and it's grown

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.280
something like six or seven

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.200
or eight times in the last year,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.360
and it's not going to go eight times every year.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.960
But if we can keep growing at anything like that speed,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840
then maybe we can

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.920
get a little bit of political influence.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.200
Labour are already very unpopular.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.720
There's a degree to which they won't care

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.600
about that at the moment,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.360
because there's not going to be

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.480
another election for four and a half years.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.480
Two, three years down the line

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.200
when they're still very unpopular

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.160
and when it starts to become clear

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.680
that you cannot improve the economy

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.920
without, well,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520
when it starts to become clear to them that

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.320
what they're doing is not working,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.400
politically they will have to have a rebrand.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.640
They will have to have a rebrand.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.960
They will have to have a new offer.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.640
I have to try to get this channel to a position where

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.480
the obvious common sense amongst the public is,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.800
you need to deal with inequality,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.240
and you need to do what Gary's Economics

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.960
says, you know,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.200
and I know maybe that sounds egotistical, but

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.640
what else can I do here,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.440
the thing is going to collapse.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.480
It's going to get worse.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.480
There's going to be really broad poverty.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.360
Labour are not going to stop it.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.720
We need to raise the voice.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.040
We need to raise the voice.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040
So I have to think about

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.480
what can we do to grow the channel.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.440
And, this year, we are

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.240
going to get another big publicity campaign

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.160
from Penguin.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.880
The paperback of the book is coming out,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.080
and I've just received it in the mail by courier.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.880
So I will open and show it to you,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.000
then new cover at the end of the video.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.320
You know, we have to try to grasp that and to grow it.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.680
We're going to be doing another

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.520
a public tour around the country.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.320
So hopefully some of you will get a chance to meet me

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.200
and ask me whatever questions you have.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.120
We have to try and take that and run with it.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.680
But what that means is

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.680
we have to professionalise the channel.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.600
Basically. I don't think we we have a choice.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.280
If we are going to be politically powerful.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.160
We need staff and I need staff.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.320
I just don't think there's any way

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.040
that I can cope with making it

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.360
significantly bigger than it is

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.400
without any full time staff, Basically.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.200
And that means we are going to need funding,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.840
and that means that we are going to open a Patreon.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.960
I spoke about it just before I went away.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.120
We're going to open a Patreon

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.680
and we're going to see what we what we get.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.520
And, you know, I don't know, it will get a lot.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.840
I don't know whether we'll get a little,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.400
but if we want to be politically powerful down

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.320
the line, we're going to need staff.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.480
And if we need staff...

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.920
we need staff, we're going to need funding.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.000
Just help support me

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.360
and help us to get a little bit more ambitious

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.080
and diverse with the creativity of what we do.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.200
Help us to work with different creatives,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.480
help us to get different people on the channel.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.520
So it's not just like me

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.480
every week in my No Face hoodie,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.520
but that's what I'm going to do.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.960
We're going to open a Patreon.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.840
We're going to put a list of like

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.560
prices in there.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.880
So I think, I think we're going to do £5 a month

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.720
or £20 a month.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.720
I want to make clear right now,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.880
we are never going to pay wall these videos.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.000
The Patreon doesn't mean, like,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.120
you need to pay towards the channel.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.520
We're never going to do that.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.520
I think I'll write a newsletter and I'll do, like,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.880
a, like a video Q&amp;A

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.840
once a month for people on the Patreon.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.800
But that Patreon is going to be there

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.560
so that we can fund staff, fund these videos.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.520
And these videos will always be free

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.440
and open to the public.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.400
But we just have to do it like it's... it's

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.560
difficult for me to run this thing

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.040
without any full time staff.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.960
And I'm very grateful for the guys who do help me.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.040
And we got a part time manager.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.120
We've got Jack here doing the camera,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.240
but we're going to need, we're gonna need more

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.360
if we're going to be serious.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.040
And I don't know if it'll work.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.160
You know,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.760
maybe we won't get enough money for staff,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.800
and maybe we won't be able to expand it. And then...

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.760
And then probably we'll never be able to have

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.920
a massive political impact.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.360
But either way, I'll keep making the videos.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.680
But it's kind of

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.800
I need to see whether we have a shot

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.600
to have an impact here.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.120
I think I have a responsibility to myself

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.800
and to the country to see, to see if I can.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.240
I'm not saying I'm going to change it by myself,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.880
but if we get a bit of funding

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.480
can maybe make a proper like professional

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.640
organisation here that can just help me,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.680
help me grow it, help me make more cool videos

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.040
and help me feel more supported and have a good run.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.480
So what what we're going to do.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.720
So I've been thinking about this while I was away.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.480
Some of you might want to know about my time in Japan.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.040
My time in Japan was amazing.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.840
It was really, really hot.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.240
I cycled from Tokyo to Hiroshima.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.680
But I've been back a few months, actually.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.720
I got back, around about the end of August.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.520
I've been working on basically setting up a company

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.680
because, I want the Patreon....

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.000
I don't want the Patreon money to come to me.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.240
I want it to go into a company

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.760
that we can release the accounts,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.520
and you can see that

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.960
none of the Patreon money goes to me.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.360
All of the Patreon money will always be used to cover

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.280
the cost of the channel.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.400
The plan at the moment is

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.800
I won't start using the Patreon money

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.920
immediately as it comes in.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.560
We'll start to like pool it a little bit there

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.960
so we can see basically how much we're getting,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.640
and then we can figure out, like, what can we do?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.560
Can we get a full time

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.640
staff member, can we get a couple?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.720
And basically try and figure out

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.600
like how much income we have

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.320
and what we can do with it?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.160
But don't expect to see any massive changes

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.800
like imminently.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.000
It's just a question of...

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.920
Really, it's a question of just professionalising it.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.560
You know, I look at sort of,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.520
what we have achieved this year with the growth.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.120
A big part of the reason we've grown so much

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.600
this year is because we've had a professional publicist

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.320
from Penguin working to publicise the channel.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.360
She's been amazing.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.960
I won't mention her name

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.360
because I don't know if she wants me to mention her,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.200
but she's been great.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.360
And, you know, the whole team at Penguin

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.880
have been great, but

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.320
the massive growth from last year,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.440
because we've had a publicist

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.160
and the publicist

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.720
ultimately doesn't work for the YouTube

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.600
or the political project.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.840
She works for the book and,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.760
you know, the book is amazing.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.000
I encorage you to buy the book.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.040
The paperback is coming out

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.680
Jan, so the paperback will be...

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.920
if you were waiting for the book to be a bit cheaper,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.280
that's going to come out in Jan 30th

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.240
and I think that's going to be something

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.200
like £11 or £12 maybe,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.880
but much cheaper than the hardback.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.640
That will come out, we'll get a big publicity campaign,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.120
but at some point,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.920
you know, Penguin are going to stop publicising us

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.840
and we need to have somebody who works for the channel

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.800
to help us publicise it.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.240
We need someone who helps us to YouTube optimise,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.240
and we need someone who just helps us make banging

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.800
videos week after week, basically.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.360
But yes,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.280
the thing I wanted to make clear

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.520
is we're going to set up a company

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.800
and all of the Patreon money will go to the company.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.960
None of it will come to me.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.280
It's not going to be used to pay me.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.720
I'm not going to take a salary.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.400
The Patreon money will always be ringfenced

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.800
for supporting production of content and

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.520
if we get enough,

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.640
ultimately trying to push a bit of a political project,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.600
trying to grow it as a political project,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.400
trying to put pressure on politicians in the long run,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.880
but basically trying to...

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.040
trying to achieve something

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.960
rather than just making videos.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.960
But we will keep making videos and good videos,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.480
and I would also, if we get enough, like to be able to

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.240
support some other creatives to help make good stuff.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.800
Like I've been making a video

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.040
with a friend of mine called Stefan.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.240
I think that's really good

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.720
and we're going to put that on the channel.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.080
He's a filmmaker,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.240
but yeah,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.600
make better content,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.840
make more frequent content,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.920
be more effective, grow quicker.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.000
But also importantly, to help me feel more supported

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.720
because I do find it difficult making these videos.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.800
I do find the kind of a level of fame I get difficult.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.480
But, look,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.360
you know, I've put this off for a long time

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.000
because, I know there's going to be like

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.960
some people that kickback...

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160
Oh this guy’s trying to make money.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.000
I'm not going to take money from the Patreon.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.160
You know, we've never put adverts in these videos

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.520
because I'm not in this to make money.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.520
I’m in this to try and educate people

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.800
about what's happening. If you don't do anything,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.160
this gets worse.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.800
But we can do something.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.040
I think if we

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.880
provide the space where the public can come

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.000
and be educated

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.760
in a way that is clear about what is happening,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.160
people can understand the reason

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.240
for their worsening living

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.280
conditions; is growing inequality.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.800
And if people understand that,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.800
they will feel empowered to fight against it.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.840
There's tons of more things I can say about that,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.080
and we will say them, but this video is getting long.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.600
But listen,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.360
nobody has to subscribe to Patreon.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.640
Like, these videos will be here

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640
like they've always been,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.120
and they'll be free like they've always been.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.560
Watch the videos, understand

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.120
the videos, share them, and support them.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.560
Share them with you friends,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.160
share them with your family.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.040
I'm not putting no pressure on nobody.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.880
If we want to grow this, we are going to need staff.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.320
And if we're going to need staff, we need funding.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.440
The funding is not going to go to me.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
It's going to go to staff.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.720
But, I'm back. I'll keep making weekly videos,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.200
for as long as I can.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.280
Last year I took a break of six months,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.000
and when I came back,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.360
the views were like higher than before I went away.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.440
And,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.920
I was quite emotional about that, to be honest,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.120
because I find it difficult

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.920
making weekly videos like, I'm not really like,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.480
you know, my background is maths and economics.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.560
I'm not like a creative

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.480
and it stresses me out

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.960
trying to do like new videos every week.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.080
And I don't like talking to camera.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.400
But the fact that people are still there

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.840
after six months really

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.600
made me feel like

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.400
I was being supported

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.600
to take the time out of that need,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.320
and it made me feel

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.560
that I can stick around in the long term.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.720
People who read my book will know

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.880
that I've had difficulties

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.800
in the past in my mental health,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.400
and I don't like being attacked in the newspapers.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.520
But this is important, and it's worth it.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.520
So...

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.600
I'll keep doing it.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.720
Thank you for your support. Happy new year.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.200
Oh, yeah.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.840
Oh, my days!

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.000
So I've got the new paperback,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.600
and you guys are going to love the cover.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.720
Good that Jack reminded me otherwise Penguin would have

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.320
chopped my balls off.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.880
So we’ll do an unboxing here.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.160
We're going to keep this

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.800
and put it on my first ASMR video.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.120
So this is the paperback.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.120
I think it's £11 or £12.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.040
I probably should have asked. Anyway, there you go.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.160
You got that focus on that alright?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.520
So they put my face on the cover,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.040
which, as you can see, it's beautiful.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.360
And I'm delighted about.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:26.520
I was...

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.040
I was a little bit, concerned about this

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.400
because obviously this will be in the window of,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.200
like, every bookshop in the country.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.440
With my face on the cover.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.160
But, at the end of the day.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.200
That's going to help us grow

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:40.640
the channel,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.120
and it's going to help us grow the political project.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.080
And I think it's important.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.160
And I'm really proud of this book

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.360
and this book has helped us grow massively this year.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.400
Well, yeah. Last year, yeah, I would recommend it.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.480
It's probably the thing

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.520
that I'm most proud of, of things

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.400
I've done in my life, really.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.160
But, yeah, this is the book.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.280
Thanks to Penguin. Thanks for all your support. And,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.520
yeah, look, we're not going to grow

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.320
eight times every year,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.440
but if we can keep growing anything

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.480
like what we've been growing,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.240
then they'll have to listen to us sooner or later.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.400
So, yeah. Thanks for your help. Good luck.
