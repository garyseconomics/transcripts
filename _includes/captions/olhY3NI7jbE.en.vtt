00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.782
Jo Coburn: *is this going to transform 
people's lives in&nbsp;these areas?*

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:08.320
Gary: well I mean if I take £15 off you and then 
give you £2.80 is that going to&nbsp;transform your life? 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.760
these guys found £2.8billion to give to local councils 
in the&nbsp;last 3 years they've given £700billion to the rich

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.800
*I know you made...* 250 times as much! listen 
is it levelling up if I&nbsp;give a poor person £2.80&nbsp;&amp;

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:31.500
I give a rich person £250? No...sorry £700! 
250 times as much, listen&nbsp;this government has

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
resided over the largest and fastest ever increase 
in inequality in the history of the country and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.040
the most Orwellian thing you've ever heard;&nbsp;
they call that 'levelling up'

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.560
*what'd you say?*

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.040
okay let's talk about what I&nbsp;
learned from going on the BBC

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.780
okay for those of you who haven't seen it I&nbsp;
did my first live BBC appearance last week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.800
on Thursday 19th of Jan on politics live um if&nbsp;
you want to see it we'll put a link to the show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.220
in the description on BBC iPlayer um we'll also&nbsp;
put a link to like a reel of my highlights that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
someone's posts up on YouTube so if you want&nbsp;
you can check that out um first thing to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.040
is that basically the reason that we've had&nbsp;
this opportunity to go on bigger shows like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
this is because of the growth of this channel&nbsp;
and all the other social media that we have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
thank you to you for everyone who subscribed 
to&nbsp;this channel to all the other channels Twitter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.780
Facebook, Instagram, TikTok... people who've shared&nbsp;
the videos who've encouraged other people to to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.120
watch and to get involved because it's that growth&nbsp;
that has enabled us to go on things like the BBC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.240
and to spread the message further so thank you&nbsp;
the second thing I want to talk about is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.620
what I learned from doing&nbsp;
the show because I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.900
from what I saw on that show it's made me&nbsp;
realize there are some ways that we could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
communicate in a way that is a bit more&nbsp;
aggressive a bit clearer and could really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
hold the government to account and get more&nbsp;
people to realize the importance of what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.780
are doing which is trying to reduce wealth&nbsp;
inequality to prevent this economic collapse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.360
so when I went on the show what I really wanted&nbsp;
to do and this would be no surprise to people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.200
who've watched the channel from the beginning&nbsp;
is really highlight the enormous amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
money that has gone from the government to&nbsp;
the richest since the beginning of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.839
that was the reason we started this channel&nbsp;
from the very from the very beginning of Covid

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:42.420
I realized that there would be an enormous transfer&nbsp;
of cash from the government to the rich that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.280
lead to a big increase in government debt which&nbsp;
would mean we'd have things like austerity and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.240
big increase in cash accumulation by the richest&nbsp;
leading to inflation and cost of living crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.140
we're seeing those things now something needs to&nbsp;
be done about it what always frustrates me is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.100
every day on the news especially in the economic&nbsp;
news there tends to be a fixation whenever some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.520
small amount of money is changing hands that day&nbsp;
in the meantime this enormous amount of money that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.440
has gone to the rich is completely ignored so in&nbsp;
the clip you saw at the beginning of this video I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.160
was asked you know what do you think about the 2.8&nbsp;
billion pounds that the government is giving to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.560
fund local services this is after they have cut&nbsp;
local service funding by 15 billion pounds and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.800
transferred 700 billion pounds to the rich I&nbsp;
think it's really key to understand that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.100
enormous amount of money that's gone to the&nbsp;
richest is at the very heart of our economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.140
crisis I think it's also important to understand&nbsp;
that that amount of money is so much bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.740
than basically any individual problem we&nbsp;
have now even when the government needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.640
to deal with the energy price crisis the&nbsp;
costing of that was about 40 or 50 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.840
pounds which is a lot in terms of government&nbsp;
funding but the amount that has gone from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.940
government to the richest in the last three&nbsp;
years is 700 billion pounds enormously more so

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.380
what I want you to know is that this amount&nbsp;
of money that has gone to the rich is much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.920
much bigger than basically anything you hear on&nbsp;
the news so whenever you see whenever you hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.120
any amount of money such as the £2.8 billion&nbsp;
going into local funding compare it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.880
£700 billion and realize it's not even nearly&nbsp;
enough to fix the massive increase inequality

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.580
second thing that I wanted to point out is&nbsp;
when I confronted the conservative minister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.100
who was on the show I said to her you know 
your&nbsp;government's given out 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.060
did you do an analysis of who has the money&nbsp;
now? do you know where the money is now?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.020
and she had nothing to say and I realized when I 
asked&nbsp;her she didn't even know that she didn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.920
where that money had gone until I asked the&nbsp;
question you know and that is because nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.620
on the media is asking the question where is this&nbsp;
money who has this money now you know this is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.020
this is like you know you came home and you&nbsp;
found your house has disappeared and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.000
worried about the fact that you dropped a tenner (£10)&nbsp;
on the floor this is an enormous amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.280
the government has given away it would be 
£14,000&nbsp;for EVERY single adult in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.780
if you don't have £14,000 more now than you&nbsp;
had at the beginning of Covid someone else has it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.360
and the government has no idea who has that&nbsp;
money now and I think I think that this could&nbsp;be&nbsp;

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:46.000
a really profitable way for us to criticise the&nbsp;
government and also to spread the message &nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.960
because it is clearly totally indefensible that they&nbsp;
do not know who has that 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.000
that's 14 000 pounds for every adult in the&nbsp;
country they've given it away and they do not know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.840
who has it and if you ask them where's the 700&nbsp;
billion pounds there's literally nothing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.120
they can say because number one they have no&nbsp;
idea who has it. number two if they did know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.200
they would have to tell you it's all gone to the&nbsp;
richest people in the country and they don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.880
to tell you that and number three it's totally&nbsp;
indefensible that they don't know so I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.280
this is you know people message me a lot&nbsp;
recently saying what can we do to help and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.200
I think the main thing that you can do is educate&nbsp;
yourself and spread the videos but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.380
more directly criticise an attack this is the&nbsp;
thing you can do you know you can call into LBC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.940
you can call into you can go on question time&nbsp;
you can go on you can post on your socials and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.200
you can say listen the government has given that&nbsp;
700 billion pounds since the beginning of Covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.040
that is £14,000 pounds for every&nbsp;
single adult in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.240
if we took that money back we could fix these&nbsp;
problems who has the money now? you can just say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.680
to the conservative government 700 billion pounds&nbsp;
14 000 pounds per adult in the country who has it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.500
now and there is nothing they can say so I think&nbsp;
this is you know when you have a big campaign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.780
ultimately you do need to be able to boil it&nbsp;
down to very simple messages and very simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.980
sound bites that can spread around and I think&nbsp;
this is a sound like that that could really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.680
legs you know I think I've mentioned before in a&nbsp;
video I was in um I was in Parliament at a meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.640
of MPs trying to convince them you know about the&nbsp;
importance of this money &amp; it was a conservative&nbsp;MP&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.680
that stood up and said who has that 450 billion&nbsp;
pounds and that that is a line of mine from an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.480
earlier video when it was only 450 billion pounds&nbsp;
and that's coming back from a conservative MP&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.880
I think what that shows is this is a message that&nbsp;
if enough people say it could really get resonance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.860
if we get enough people saying where's the 700&nbsp;
billion pounds where's the 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.660
you know that can appeal to people on both the&nbsp;
left and the right because it's a clear attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.200
that the government should know the government&nbsp;
should have an answer to that question they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.480
so I think if you want to do something now and&nbsp;
you have the time and you have the energy now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.160
get out there tell your friends tell&nbsp;your 
family post on your socials you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.500
call into the phone in shows go onto&nbsp;question 
time you know go on to whatever it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.800
whoever the guy Jeremy Vine that&nbsp;
does channel five in the mornings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.260
call in and say listen the government's given&nbsp;
that 700 billion pounds since the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.640
Covid who has that now because we need that the&nbsp;
NHS needs that ordinary families who can't pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.600
their bills need that and it's sitting in the bank&nbsp;
accounts of the richest people in the country so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.180
what I realise I'm going on *BBC* is that&nbsp;
the government has a massive weakness here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.120
and we the ordinary people of&nbsp;
the country who are struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.740
um and people who should be criticising the&nbsp;
government in the media are not making the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:57.300
of it so here's a fantastic opportunity to attack&nbsp;
the government and force them to give us an answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.820
because if they look into it and actually&nbsp;
find out who has that 700 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.480
they will find that it's sitting in the&nbsp;
bank accounts of the richest people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.920
the country driving up the prices of the&nbsp;
things you need of the houses you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.420
and making it increasingly impossible for&nbsp;
ordinary families just to live their lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.220
so I think this is a great opportunity&nbsp;
and you know I've said in recent videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.160
I'm really planning to challenge the government&nbsp;
in the longer term here but I know there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.000
people that have the energy now to do&nbsp;
something now here is a real weakness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.280
attack them tell your friends tell your family&nbsp;
they're giving out 700 billion pounds and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.980
don't even know who they've given it to they&nbsp;
do not even know who they've given it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.400
um and what I'm going to do now we're going 
to&nbsp;film uh today a series of videos about the&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.160
£700 *billion* to help you understand better what&nbsp;
it is, who has it and how it's been affecting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.920
economy um I will keep you updated because that&nbsp;
number 700 billion because the government is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.380
having to pay so much money to support ordinary&nbsp;
families who often can't take care of themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.860
because of this massive inflation caused by&nbsp;
that mass increase in cash by the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.000
the government is churning up more and more money&nbsp;
which means they will go more and more into debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.900
um so it will become 800 it'll become 900&nbsp;
eventually it'll become a trillion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.680
I'll keep you updated with that and I'll&nbsp;
keep you educated about what it means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.260
um but it's a great opportunity you know use it&nbsp;
use it use it as a line post it on your Facebook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.040
where's the where's the 700 billion pounds how&nbsp;
do we get it back because that is enough money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.740
to solve this economic crisis and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.200
make life livable for ordinary families and&nbsp;
instead all it is doing is making the richest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.560
people in the country unbelievably richer um so&nbsp;
yeah um we'll put the links in the description&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.840
for the appearance on BBC if you haven't seen&nbsp;
it um check it out I hope you enjoy it thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.800
um you know the Channel's growing the voice&nbsp;
is growing and um hopefully eventually we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.640
can we can stop this economic disaster and&nbsp;
that's because of your support so thank you

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.820
at the moment these guys are profiting from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.820
crisis that is going to keep our&nbsp;
economy in a slump for 50 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.580
there's one other thing they can do with that mass&nbsp;
amount of income they can buy your mom's house
