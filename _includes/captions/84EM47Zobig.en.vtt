00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.380
my plan is to get people to understand&nbsp;
if we don't act things will get worse

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
that is really powerful right because things&nbsp;
are bad now but people are willing to accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.960
it because they think it's temporary&nbsp;
and they think things will get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.160
if people were aware simultaneously&nbsp;
that things will get worse which they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
will and that is fixable which&nbsp;
it is they would demand action

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.260
for me change is still the goal but&nbsp;
it's a long-term goal because I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.740
you know what what I'm want&nbsp;
to do what I'm trying to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
is it's a big thing it's difficult it's not easy&nbsp;
it's not just something you're going to go out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.240
there and you're going to achieve like it's&nbsp;
um you know the situation is really really bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.360
um and it's it's a situation which is enriching&nbsp;
most powerful people in the world right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.360
a lot of them want it to continue um and&nbsp;
there are some rich and powerful people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
are saying we need to reduce it we need to do&nbsp;
something about it but most people most rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.120
people feel they're benefiting from it right&nbsp;
so if you if you're trying to do something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.740
which most rich and powerful people&nbsp;
oppose it's difficult right so for me

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.420
I want to achieve change but

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.340
I know that that is a massive task and we will&nbsp;
only achieve that if we have long term thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.340
so I guess now is a good time to talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.020
a question we've got getting a lot on the channel&nbsp;
recently which is what can we do what can I do um

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.680
and for me

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.240
I think it's really important&nbsp;
that people understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.440
we cannot win this fight in the short term it's&nbsp;
too big it's too difficult and me personally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.880
I'm not thinking short term because I&nbsp;
don't think we can win this short term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.340
I think that but I do think we can win it&nbsp;
and I think the the way that we can win it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.440
is by spreading the message

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.040
that if nothing is done about growing inequality&nbsp;
and growing inequality of wealth things will get &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.260
really seriously worse not just for the poor but&nbsp;
for 70 80 90 percent relatively quickly um

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:58.260
and the power of that message is that it's&nbsp;
true and I remember when we first started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.380
this channel which was around about the&nbsp;
same time I first started writing articles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.920
I remember my second ever published article which&nbsp;
is for the website open democracy they they called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.800
me up and they were like your first like was&nbsp;
really good do you want to write a second one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.980
and I said what I want to do is just make a list&nbsp;
of predictions just a list of predictions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.340
partly that was because my professional&nbsp;
history as a trader is making predictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.260
making predictions which people don't think are&nbsp;
right but will turn out to be right that's how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.400
you make money as a trader so as a trader all&nbsp;
I was trying to do was think what is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.300
going to happen that people don't realise and you&nbsp;
know all those predictions were terrible things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.740
massive increase in inequality, massive increase in&nbsp;
house prices, massive increase in inflation, massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.980
decrease in living standards right but the reason&nbsp;
I wanted to make those predictions is because

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.680
there's a power in being right that you&nbsp;
can only get from understanding the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.700
if your arguments are wrong then your predictions&nbsp;
will be wrong but the power that we have is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.160
this generates correct prediction so these things&nbsp;
I say I'm gonna are gonna happen they will happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
so if we keep going out there and making these&nbsp;
predictions and saying this will happen this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.660
happen this will happen this will happen specific&nbsp;
things like I'm saying now house prices are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.200
to go through the roof you know I mean &amp; living&nbsp;
stands will continue to fall these kinds of things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.460
um you know people can go out now and look&nbsp;
at video from two and a half years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.960
of me basically saying everything that's happened&nbsp;
has happened that's powerful you see what I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.720
saying um that's the strength of the message&nbsp;
the strength of the message is that it's right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.820
the weakness of the message and the&nbsp;
trouble we're going to have is this&nbsp;is a&nbsp;

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.980
f***ing bleak message right it's a bleak&nbsp;
message and people don't want to believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.020
that society is headed into a disaster an&nbsp;
explosion in poverty you know collapse in living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.340
standards people don't want to believe they are&nbsp;
I don't want to believe that you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.800
um so that is what we have to fight&nbsp;
against and I think the way that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:19.080
fight against that is we have to first of all&nbsp;
we have to speak with compassion all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.000
and we have to speak with an awareness that&nbsp;
other people are getting hit more than us and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.080
you know you said yourself you came into this&nbsp;
channel because you're aware you're in a much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.480
better situation than others you know what I mean&nbsp;
and I'm always aware of that you know so we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.500
to be compassionate when we speak and understand&nbsp;
that people are struggling but on top of that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.540
need to provide this positivity of message which&nbsp;
is if we do something about this wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.000
if we manage to reverse that motion of increasing&nbsp;
wealth inequality and start driving wealth in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.940
other direction we can really see living standards 
and&nbsp;quality of living improve and I think that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.740
100% true as well so we need to combine with that&nbsp;
positive message I think that's probably something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.540
that we haven't done enough that I haven't done&nbsp;
enough to provide that positivity on the side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.540
um and I think that's partially because it's hard&nbsp;
for me person you know this is something which you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.000
know I've gone around for 12-13 years now betting
that society is going to go to s*** you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.880
what I mean and being right and making millions&nbsp;
of pounds doing that and um you know people can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.620
point to me and say well that's great for you but&nbsp;
you know what I mean I've known since I was in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.440
mid-20s that society is you know is collapsing&nbsp;
and I have to carry that around you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.520
mean you know it's not dinner party conversation&nbsp;
you know you go on a date and people say what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.000
your job and you know and if they what do you do&nbsp;
what do you think you know are you going to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.320
them well what I think is poverty is going to&nbsp;
explode the middle class is going to disappear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.920
there's going to be you know living standards&nbsp;
will collapse you know you want to tell somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.840
that this is a thing I have to carry around&nbsp;
with me so I think that sometimes that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.060
difficult burden for me to carry maybe I want to&nbsp;
share that but like we need to be able to find

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.060
some hope and some positivity to bring&nbsp;
people in um but I think at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.220
what I would say to the people who are saying what&nbsp;
can I do what can I do what can I do is firstly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.320
that I'm mad grateful for the support that these&nbsp;
people provide ultimately like my plan is to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.180
and make my voice as big as possible and this&nbsp;
platform as big as possible so that we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:34.260
have power to force politicians to act that's&nbsp;
my plan so my plan is a 100% dependent on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.480
support of the people who watch and and people&nbsp;
who watch sharing and helping it to grow so it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.280
we absolutely 100% need them they are the whole plan&nbsp;
and I appreciate that they want to help me now um

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.080
but what I need to tell them is we are not strong&nbsp;
enough to win this now we are not strong enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.960
to win this now and I'm not planning to win this&nbsp;
today I'm not planning to win this tomorrow I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.560
not planning to win this next year I'm not&nbsp;
planning to win this the year after this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.460
going to be a massive fight a massive fight and&nbsp;
I'm thinking long term I'm thinking long term so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.860
really that's why all I'm thinking about is growth&nbsp;
grow the voice, grow the power, grow the message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.720
and you know I'm writing this book because&nbsp;I 
think that's going to give us growth down the&nbsp;line&nbsp;

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.160
and that's taking me away from being able to&nbsp;
promote the YouTube as much as I would like to&nbsp;

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.560
but ultimately I'm not trying to be big next month&nbsp;
I'm trying to be big in five years time you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.200
what I mean because I want to be big enough that&nbsp;
I can force these politicians to do something so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.220
I know there's people out there want to do&nbsp;
something now I want to do something now and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:45.180
you know it's frustrating for me that all I can&nbsp;
really say is look push us help us to grow you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.140
know that's I wish I could give more and you&nbsp;
know there are people you know there's there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.040
that there's this guy's made a song for us you&nbsp;
know what I mean and I would love to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.020
support and push that I appreciate this stuff that&nbsp;
people are doing and really I appreciate it but

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.920
there's only so much I can do to support other&nbsp;
people at the moment I'm trying to grow it you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.980
know what I mean I've got to write this book I'm&nbsp;
writing the book every day we're making the videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.840
um so what I would beg for people watching 
is&nbsp;support us be patient we're building this&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.760
is a long-term project and I know like you&nbsp;
know I know like if we had time if we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.600
energy we would do a meet-up we would do a&nbsp;
rally this kind of stuff but ultimately like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.260
this is about power this is about power you&nbsp;
know and and the only way we have power to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.840
force change is that is to build is to grow&nbsp;
more people more people long term um

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.920
so yeah that is the strategy and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.260
at the moment I'm not even really able to even&nbsp;
reply to all the messages right but it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:54.300
the reason that I keep emphasizing&nbsp;
when people ask community is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:04.680
ultimately my plan is to get people to&nbsp;
understand if we don't act things will get worse

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.680
that is really powerful right because things&nbsp;
are bad now but people are willing to accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.260
it because they think it's temporary&nbsp;
and they think things will get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.600
if people were aware simultaneously that things&nbsp;
will get worse which they will and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.380
fixable which it is they would demand action so I&nbsp;
think this single message that wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.920
if it is allowed to get worse will&nbsp;
make people's lives worse and worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.240
that message can take the whole thing down
because if people knew that they wouldn't accept it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.440
but the way we disseminate that message is by&nbsp;
spreading this message on this channel through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.380
people's links of community you know I don't&nbsp;
have enough money to build a social movement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.880
with my money what we have is a message and I&nbsp;
am depending upon ordinary people to spread it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.060
through their links of community you see what&nbsp;
I'm saying so I need people to be together

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.920
because that is how we build the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:13.440
and I see in things like for example the way the&nbsp;
government is allowing the strikes to go on that

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.940
many people what they want is to&nbsp;
create division amongst ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.920
Ordinary working-class People because if&nbsp;
people in the private sector are hating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.580
people in the public sector are people who are&nbsp;
not striking hating people who are striking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.700
then we can't come together and we&nbsp;
can't build this positive message so

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.400
I wish I could do more and you know once the 
book&nbsp;is done we'll sit down and we'll think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.320
you know how can we better utilise the things&nbsp;
we want to support and how can we be better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.660
help them spread the message but at the moment&nbsp;
like you know it's just me and you and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.240
resources are limited you know um but we will grow&nbsp;
it we will grow it but at the moment because I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.040
prioritizing that medium long-term growth it means&nbsp;
I'm taken away a little bit from the short-term&nbsp;growth&nbsp;

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.640
but um yeah I think I honestly think we've&nbsp;
got a shot to create change but I think the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.200
watching it you know you know we live in a now 
now now culture right you know people you&nbsp;know&nbsp;

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.140
this is not Celebrity Big Brother you know&nbsp;you 
don't watch it for 10 weeks &amp; then I get&nbsp;famous

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.360
you know I mean it's not how it works right&nbsp;this 
is a big project this is a big project but um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.260
you know right now we've got what 50-60,000 subs&nbsp;
you know if we have a million subs then we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.880
start making s*** happen but we we need to get&nbsp;
that you know what I mean you know 100k-200k&nbsp;

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.380
subs is not enough so we need to get that growth&nbsp;
and then then we can make it a movement you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.960
know and then there'll be money coming in&nbsp;
and then we can hire people to help us grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:45.900
even more you know what I mean um but that's&nbsp;
that's how it has to be man it's it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.720
we have to be looking for long-term growth&nbsp;
we have to be looking for long-term growth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.500
because we will not win this in the short&nbsp;
term we'll not win this in the short term and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.820
that is a bleak message but we're gonna have&nbsp;
some bleak times man we're gonna have some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.840
bleak years and that is the other reason why&nbsp;
I tell people to focus on community because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.640
it's you know you can see it right now right you&nbsp;
can see in the increase in long-term illness in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.940
the increase in mental illness man like things are&nbsp;
tough things are going to get tougher and if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.980
you know they can take our money away from us and&nbsp;
they can make our lives more materially insecure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.400
and I'm aware that it's not happening to me you&nbsp;
know I'm aware that I'm comfortable but that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.400
what's going to happen to ordinary people&nbsp;
but they can't take away is your connections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.200
with your friends and your families in your&nbsp;
community so I think these are the things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.320
people are going to need number one to fight 
back&nbsp;politically in the long term and number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:50.760
two just to make life livable man like you that&nbsp;
is what people are going to need so um I think

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.600
people need to fight back against the division &amp;&nbsp;try 
&amp; communicate with one another with compassion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.900
and I know that's difficult um and in terms of&nbsp;
supporting us man just just keep doing what you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.760
doing spread spread the message share it around um&nbsp;
I wish I could give you more things and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.300
I see people that post you know call into LBC get&nbsp;
on the TV whatever you can just spread the spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.680
the word spread the word but also like be aware&nbsp;
this is a long-term fight so don't burn yourself&nbsp;out&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.240
hold yourself in help us grow we're going to&nbsp;
grow and then when we're big enough if we ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.940
get there then we will try to make change happen&nbsp;
but you know we don't want to shoot the load too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.560
early man we're building we're building for power&nbsp;
so we can get change that that's that's the plan

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.760
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.960
many more options in how we live our lives 
some&nbsp;of them put a lot of money into paying 

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.440
economists and think thanks to tell you that 
inequality&nbsp;is important for the economy

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.140
that is not true!
