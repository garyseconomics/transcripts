00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.360
Okay.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.040
Today we are going to introduce

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.520
the first part of our online course.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.880
Video number one, which is going to be What is Wealth.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.200
Okay so I was at a conference

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.400
the other day, a conference about economics media,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.440
and there was a guy who basically spoke about how

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.760
when people watch Jordan Peterson's videos,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
they don't just watch his recent videos,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.920
they go back to the beginning

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.040
and they watch it through.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.320
Because what people want is an online course

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.520
where they can follow the subject through

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.920
so they understand it completely.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.080
And he could do a MOOC. Massive Open Online Course.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.360
And it got me thinking about this channel.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.640
Basically,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360
this channel in my eyes is an educational channel

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.400
which is to teach

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.160
and educate ordinary people about economics,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.440
basically pushing a specific narrative,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440
which is that living

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.920
standards are falling

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.800
because wealth inequality is increasing.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.320
If you want to stop the decrease in living standards,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.760
we need to stop the increase in wealth inequality.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.280
But obviously I'm out here every week, making a video

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.880
every week.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.240
You see a different video every week.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.000
And I kind of worry that if somebody actually comes in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.360
and they want to,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960
you know, understand exactly what we're doing here,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080
they just see like 100 different videos.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.240
They don't know where to start.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
And it becomes quite difficult

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.560
for people to educate themselves.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.160
And, you know, we often get people asking us questions

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800
which have been addressed in previous videos.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440
Like, for example, people say,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.440
what do you mean when you say government gave hundreds

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.840
of billions of pounds to the rich during Covid?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.800
The question we get asked tons recently is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.120
can you really tax the rich?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.040
If you tax them, won't they just leave?

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.400
We can asked questions about money,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.600
questions about debt,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200
which are answered in previous videos,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.800
and I suppose I could try

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.440
and go back to historical videos

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.160
and try and link something together.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.360
But what I wanted to do was start creating

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.560
in amongst the other videos

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.400
we make,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
a set of videos which are structured

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.120
and designed to be watched in order

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.960
such that anybody who comes to this channel

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.600
in a year's time or in two years

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.440
time, can go and watch basically this online course

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.720
that is really structured

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.600
and explains everything in a step by step fashion

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.400
about what

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.840
I'm saying and about my ideas

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600
about wealth inequality in the economy,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.120
so that you can understand things

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.640
in a really structured way, basically.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.000
I wanted to add

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.680
basically a structured element to the channel

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.080
so that we keep the videos every Sunday.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240
But over time we start to build up

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.200
certain videos

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.120
which are designed to be watched in order,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.800
and we put them together as an online course.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.880
And today we are going to start that

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.680
and we are going to do video number one in the course.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.280
And video number one is going to be called

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.800
What is Wealth, which is a very simple video

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.040
which is introducing the concept of wealth to people.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.240
Because often economists don't talk much about wealth.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.440
They talk about things like income.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.560
They talk about things like jobs,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.760
they talk about things like unemployment,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.240
but they don't talk about things like wealth.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.560
When I talk about inequality,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.240
I'm always talking about wealth inequality

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.040
rather than income inequality.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.640
And then in order to understand that,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.440
you need to understand wealth.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.880
So what is wealth?

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.400
First thing is wealth is different to income.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.560
Now I think for most ordinary people

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.280
their financial situation

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.360
is basically about their income,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.200
which is about what job they do.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.080
When I was a kid,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
I thought that if you wanted to be rich,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.920
you got a job in a bank and you made,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.360
you know, £100,000 a year.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.960
If you can make £100,000 a year salary,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.840
you're super rich.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.240
And the difference between financial positions

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.960
of most ordinary people

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.240
is largely about what job do you do.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.880
It's important to understand

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.960
there are a group of people

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.600
whose income does not come from their work.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.960
Their income comes from wealth.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.280
What is wealth?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.600
Wealth is about ownership of things, of assets.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.080
Now, the most

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.440
practical and close to ordinary

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.560
people's lives example of wealth is housing.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.040
So some people own their own house they live in.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.640
Some people don't own their own house

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.800
they live in and they rent their house.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.280
Some people own their house with a massive mortgage.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.560
Some people own the house

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.880
with a very small or no mortgage.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.360
This is the most obvious example

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.080
of how some people have wealth and some people don't.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.720
If you own your house

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.120
with no mortgage, you don't need to pay interest.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.600
You don't need to pay rent.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.920
You simply can live in that house essentially for free.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.600
If you don't own a house, you will have to pay either

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.320
interest on a very large mortgage,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.120
or you’ll have to pay rent.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.520
So these houses exist the house that I live in exists.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.920
Outside there's lots of houses and lots of flats.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.320
Everything exists. Everything is owned by somebody.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.040
That's the first thing.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.880
If you don't own your own house, somebody else owns it.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.160
Either through lending

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080
you money for your mortgage or directly

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.760
they own it and you pay them rent.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.720
So the first form of wealth, housing, it exists.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.320
It's everything... it's everywhere.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.640
Everything is owned by somebody.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.240
I think this is quite visible.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.880
People know that housing is important.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.600
People know that either they own their own home

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.160
or they don't own their own home.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.120
If they don't own their own

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.080
home, they have to pay rent.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.520
I think what

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.000
people often fail to realise

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is that there is much more wealth

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.560
other than housing in our society.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.600
So I'm looking out here through this window.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.120
I can see Whitechapel, there's a massive hospital right

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.920
there, that's Royal London Hospital,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.720
that's worth an enormous amount of money.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.480
It's owned by somebody. That's a form of wealth.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.360
If I look out here back then to my right,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.600
I can see Canary Wharf.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.720
There's a bunch of enormous skyscrapers.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.040
These skyscrapers are worth

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.400
an enormous amount of money.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.400
They are owned by somebody. That is wealth.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.520
There's a railway line out here

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.480
that is owned by somebody, that is wealth.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.600
If I go just out here onto the main street,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.040
that's Commercial Road,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.600
there's lots of shops, there's lots of restaurants.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.240
If I go over there

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.360
to Stratford, Westfield,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.600
there's an enormous shopping centre.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.840
In the centre of London there are tons of skyscrapers.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.920
There are theatres.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.080
There are pubs, bars, restaurants, shopping centres.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.480
This is commercial wealth.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.400
Now, what is interesting about commercial wealth

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720
is ordinary people don't normally own it, right?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.280
Ordinary people often struggling to own their own home.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.960
They don't consider when they go to work in an office

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.760
or whether they go to shop in Tescos,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.720
whether they go to a restaurant

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.360
that these commercial buildings are also owned as well.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.760
Now, this is a massive part of wealth

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640
and the fact that ordinary people

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.320
often don't own their own homes.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.040
But more...

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.480
but

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.480
very often

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.760
don't own a significant chunk

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.720
of the commercial property

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.680
tells us another real fact about wealth,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.240
which is that

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.160
property in many cases

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.520
is owned by ordinary people, by the middle class.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.520
But commercial property is overwhelmingly owned

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.160
by the rich.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.600
So what is wealth?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.800
Largely in this country it's property,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.280
residential property, but also commercial property.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.400
Residential property is often owned by ordinary people.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400
Commercial property

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.120
is overwhelmingly owned by the rich.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.760
One other big form of wealth

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.120
which is important to recognise is debt.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.400
Now when you first hear that,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.200
that might sound a little bit counterintuitive

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.080
because you think, okay, debt is not wealth,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.560
debt is like a bad thing to have.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.680
Debt is like negative wealth.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.880
One thing you need to understand

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.880
is that debt always balances out.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.880
If one person is in debt, another person is in credit.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.240
So if you owe £400,000 on your mortgage,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.680
that ultimately is owed to somebody.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.960
One form of debt which gets an enormous amount of press

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.520
at the moment is government debt.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.200
So the government has an enormous amount

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.960
of debt, it's equivalent to something like,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.160
I haven't done the numbers recently,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.360
but I think it's like £30 - 35,000

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.240
per person in the UK.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.400
This enormous amount of government

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.360
debt is owed to somebody.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.680
Debt often confuses slightly

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.960
the real ownership of wealth,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.280
because the main form of wealth

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.360
which ordinary people own in this country,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.640
the UK, it’s the same in

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.800
a lot of other countries, is their home,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.880
but very often

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.040
they own their home

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.440
by using an enormous amount of debt.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.520
So if, for example,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.160
you live in London

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.840
and you own a home that costs £500,000,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.120
which is a pretty

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.680
average cost for a home here in London,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.400
you might have a mortgage of 400,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.640
maybe even £450,000 on that house.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.640
If you own a £500,000 house with a £400,000 mortgage,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.960
basically you only own

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.280
20% of the wealth in your home,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.360
and the other 80% is owned by

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.200
essentially whoever owns your mortgage.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.200
Debt, like commercial property,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
unlike residential property,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.120
is another form of wealth

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.120
which is overwhelmingly owned by the rich.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.720
Now, there are a lot of ways which...

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
there are lot of misunderstandings

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.480
about wealth, firstly, a comment

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.480
we often get is, no actually ordinary people own

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.520
their commercial property,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.520
they own the debt to their pensions.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600
And to a tiny degree this is true.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.000
If you have a pension, if you have some savings,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.880
you will own some other people's debts.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.120
If you own some stocks and shares,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.760
you will own some small

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.720
share of the commercial property.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.680
But really, it's a little bit of a red herring,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.520
because overwhelmingly,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.240
the amount on which ordinary people own

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.520
is tiny compared to the amount that the rich own.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.560
Rich people have enormous funds, stock and share

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.120
portfolios, enormous pension

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.040
funds through which they own these things.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.000
Ordinary people do own a little sliver

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.200
through their pension funds, but ordinary people own

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.400
only a very small percentage.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400
So what is wealth?

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.040
Wealth is not about income.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.640
Wealth is not about your job.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.080
Wealth is about who owns the physical

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.480
things in your country, the buildings, the property,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.640
the natural resources.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.600
You know, we didn't mention farmland.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.360
The kind of wealth that is relevant

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.200
is different in different countries.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.800
You know, if you're talking about

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.320
a country like Saudi Arabia,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.160
like Qatar,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.840
who owns the oil is an enormous part of the wealth.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.840
You know, in a very agricultural country,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.080
who owns the land is a big part of the wealth.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.400
In this country, the UK, and it's similar

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.960
to a lot of

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.960
developed countries, it's largely about properties,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.640
which is residential property, commercial property.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.400
In some countries you might have a lot of factories.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.960
You know, obviously China has a lot of factories.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.920
Germany has more factories than we do.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.200
But basically there is a lot of physical wealth

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.400
in the country.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.480
Properties, buildings, natural resources, land,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.560
productive things like the energy production capacity,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.040
the windmills, the coal plants,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.080
the oil plants, the nuclear plants.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.880
There is all this physical wealth in the country.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.720
Ordinary people

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.680
in most cases own only their own property.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.000
And in many cases that's only through debt.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.400
All of the rest of the wealth is owned by

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.520
essentially very wealthy people.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.160
And this leads to cash flows.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.480
The people who don't own the wealth

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.440
have to pay the people who do own the wealth

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.240
in order to use the wealth.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.520
The most obvious example of

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.000
this is if you don't own your own home,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.400
you will have to pay rent

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.640
to the person who does own your home.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.920
If you do it in your home,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.800
but using a massive mortgage,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.280
you will have to pay interest

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.200
to the person who does own your mortgage.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.800
And we spoke about the commercial property.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.880
So this extends all through the commercial property.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.840
So when you go shopping at Tesco,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.040
part of the money that you pay

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.760
will go to the owner of that physical building

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.120
that your Tesco superstore is based in.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.240
Some of it will go not just to

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.600
the farmer who maybe produced the food you buy,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.520
but also to the landowner who owns the land.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.440
Some of it will go to

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.640
the people who owned the energy resources that

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.480
transported the food to the supermarket.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.400
When you pay your taxes, a big chunk of your tax

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.160
goes as interest payments

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.720
to the people who own the government debt.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.640
So real wealth exists.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.320
Debt exists.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.560
Ordinary people have to pay the wealth owners

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.400
every single time. They basically spend any money.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.440
Your rent, your mortgages, your food,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.480
your bills, your taxes.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.400
When you go to a restaurant,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.280
when you go to a pub, when you go on holiday,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.560
when you go to the supermarket,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.800
a little chunk of every single thing

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.720
you spend is going to the wealth owners.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.440
Which means there is a big net flow of cash

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.760
every day, every week, every month, every year

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.120
from ordinary people who don't own much wealth,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.640
to very rich people who do own wealth.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.240
These are basic concepts.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.560
But it's important to understand,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.120
because I think a lot of people

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.160
who are not rich don't

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.720
realise how much wealth there is,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.760
and they don't realise they're paying to use it.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.880
Mainly, they don't realise

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.000
how wealthy, wealthy people are.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.320
And we're going to go in

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.520
in our next video in the online

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.160
course to how that affects you

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.600
and how that affects the economy.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:36.960
Okay.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.000
So that's video one of the online course,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.080
What is Wealth.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.600
We’re going to keep doing these videos

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.320
alongside the other videos.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.640
We’re going to put them up on the YouTube

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.480
in a separate...

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.520
what do you call them, those things?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.680
Yeah. In a separate playlist.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.320
We're going to put them up

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.040
in a separate playlist on the YouTube,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.240
so that over time

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.760
we build up a course that people can watch

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760
from the ground up

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.480
and start to understand everything

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.000
in a really clear, simple way what we're doing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.640
We're not going to stop the other videos we're doing.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.320
The more topical videos, the more salacious videos,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.760
which I know you all love.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.120
And the more,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.040
yeah, educational videos

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.720
pushing for changing the tax system.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720
But hopefully this will give newcomers over the years

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.040
a place to really develop all of their understanding.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.280
Okay. Thank you.
