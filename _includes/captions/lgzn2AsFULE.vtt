00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
Okay welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.720
This week we are going to answer the question

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.280
are Labour unlucky or are they just rubbish?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.080
Okay so this week is Labour conference 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.800
Labour for anyone who is not in the country

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.080
are the traditional centre left party of the UK

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.760
they are in government, they won an election last year

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.080
so just before the election last year

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.120
I did a video

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.880
saying that Labour would win a massive landslide

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.080
and then become incredibly unpopular very quickly

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.120
which is exactly what has happened

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.960
a lot of polls show it's the biggest and fastest

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240
ever fall in popularity

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.920
for any new government in the country

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.040
and this has led to the question of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.240
why are Labour perceived to have been doing so badly?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.880
Why are Labour so unpopular so quickly?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.040
And a narrative is kind of forming from Labour

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.720
or people have supported from Labour

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.480
which is basically that Labour are unlucky.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.120
Today we're gonna ask the question whether that is true

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.120
I think it's a really really interesting question

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.680
because I think it is actually

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.360
true that Labour are unlucky

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.560
but completely

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.360
not for the reasons that they think they're unlucky

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.160
or that they say they're unlucky. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
So what is the Labour argument?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.240
The classic Labour argument is basically

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.440
that they are unlucky

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.000
because they inherited an extremely bad

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.320
financial situation

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120
from the conservatives and that is true

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600
government debt is very high

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.040
inequality increased massively during Covid, in fact

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.480
the reason that I started this channel

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.840
at the beginning of 2020 was because I was predicting

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.600
that the economy would collapse

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.720
that government finances would collapse

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.960
that we would have a massive cost of living crisis

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.600
The fact that government finances were so bad

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.600
was basically exactly the reason

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.360
I was able to predict that Labour would be

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.000
really unpopular really quickly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.800
Basically if you go back and look at my video

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.400
maybe we'll link it here from before the election

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.320
What I basically said was

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.400
we are in the midst of an economic crisis that

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.520
is being caused by economic mismanagement

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.200
inequality has increased massively

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.760
the assets are increasingly owned by the rich

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.240
If you don't tax the rich

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.120
living standards will keep falling

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
and this is why basically

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.680
we could predict very easily that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.440
Labour would become very unpopular

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.800
for this very simple reason

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.800
living standards are falling

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200
because of rising inequality

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600
Labour wasn't gonna take action on inequality

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880
for that reason living standards would keep falling

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.480
which would mean Labour would be very unpopular

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.840
very quickly and this is basically the argument

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.680
which Labour politicians have been making

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.880
I was watching Sky News this morning

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.360
as I make my breakfast, as I do

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.880
and there was a Labour advisor there saying

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.360
you know this is not really our fault

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.640
there was no way of us knowing this would happen

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.560
we didn't know

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.000
for example that Trump would would bring his tariffs in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.360
we didn't know these things would happen and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.600
we were left a really bad legacy by the conservatives

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.000
and this is not really our fault

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.360
and what this reminded me of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.680
was a speech given by Jeremy Hunt

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.440
two and a half years ago.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.240
Jeremy Hunt was a Conservative chancellor

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.520
so different 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.760
different prime minister, a different government

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.040
Where at the time people were very unhappy

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.120
because living standards were falling

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.520
the economy was weak and what Jeremy Hunt said was

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.280
we know that living standards are falling

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.760
and the economy is weak but it's not our fault

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.440
because there have been a series of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.800
of black swan events and what a black swan event is,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.720
is just something very unfortunate and very rare

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.160
has happened. Black swans are rare

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.840
so a black swan event is a rare event

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.520
and I did a video on this idea cause I found it really

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.160
really interesting because when Jeremy Hunt said that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.560
at that time, I had been saying very consistently for

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.080
three and a half years that living standards would fall

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.600
that we'd have a cost of living crisis

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.040
that we'd have an inflation crisis

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.240
I was explaining exactly why

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.640
I was betting on it I was making a lot of money on it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.680
so it's kind of interesting

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.080
and kind of funny for me to see Jeremy Hunt

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.640
come in and say oh my god

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.280
the economy is collapsing

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.320
aren't we terribly unlucky

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.840
who could possibly have predicted this

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.720
and now here we are two and a half years later

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.720
with a Labour government who are in power

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.240
that have failed on the economy in the exact precise

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.080
specific way that I predicted that they would fail

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.600
one year ago, two years ago

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.160
four years ago, five years ago

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.840
and they are now saying the same thing

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.000
which is, ‘oh my god

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.440
aren't we terribly unlucky

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.360
how could we ever have predicted this’.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.760
So let's be clear, was this avoidable?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.640
In one sense, no

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.800
which is the sense that I predicted

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.120
these living standards would collapse, five

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.080
sex years ago. Well,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.600
five years ago at the beginning of Covid

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.720
At the beginning of Covid

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.520
we knew that we were going to significantly increase

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.640
wealth inequality

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240
in this country, in your country

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.520
wherever you are across the world

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.160
we knew that government finances would collapse

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.560
we knew that the rich would get much richer

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.320
It's not rocket science right?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320
If you massively

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.840
change the wealth distribution in your country

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160
if you massively impoverish the government

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.560
and you massively increase the wealth of the rich

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.560
that will affect living standards in a predictable way.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.080
Your government will be poorer

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960
your government services will get worse

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.240
the rich will get richer

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.600
their living standards will increase

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.440
and ordinary people will get less

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.680
this is like really really

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.200
really really

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.680
really obvious. So in that sense

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.000
what is happening now has been obvious

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.600
ever since the beginning of Covid

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.920
Was it avoidable? 100% yes

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.760
there's this really frustrating way

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.680
that people talk about government finances

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.400
and government debt as if this is just like money

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.120
which has just disappeared and

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.480
and we can never get it back

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.360
and like, god has it now, we've sinned

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.200
we can never get it back. That money

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.280
which the government gave out

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.840
is sitting now in the bank accounts

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.920
of the richest people in the country

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.160
and the richest people in the world

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.000
What I said, you can go back and watch it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
in the beginning of my video was

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.680
if you want to avoid a cost of living crisis

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.200
a massive economic catastrophe

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.040
and massive decrease in living standards

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.280
you need to start working now to fix your tax system

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.320
so that we, the people of the country

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.040
can reclaim that wealth back from the rich

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.320
If you do not deal with the problem

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.520
you have in your tax system

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.360
which is that you're not really ready

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.320
or willing or able to tax the rich

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.640
you will have no choice

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.520
but to accept decreased living standards.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.840
We said this publicly

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.360
we got a decent bit of press even back in 2020

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.560
you know, I wrote in the Guardian

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.680
I wrote for a lot of publications

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.760
by the time of last year's election

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.720
this YouTube channel was quite big

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.200
and we and the people that we work

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.560
with were lobbying Labour pretty aggressively

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.120
saying basically this exact thing

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.640
which is, you know

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.760
when you come in, if you do not take action on

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.800
massively increased inequality

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.520
inability to tax the rich

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.280
you will end up in a situation where basically

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.640
you have no choice but to either slash the state

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.000
or try and tax the middle class

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.600
which is exactly where the government are now

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.240
so was it fixable? Yes

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.200
if they had listened to us

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.520
could they fixed it? Yes

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.760
so are they unlucky? No

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.520
was it predictable? Yes

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.440
could something have been done? Yes

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.720
are Labour unlucky? No

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.560
I've been screaming about this for five or six years

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.760
something could have been done

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.400
something hasn't been done

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.880
Labour should have been thinking about it

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.960
when they're in opposition

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.760
Labour should have been thinking about it

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.640
before the election, they didn't

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.160
that is why they're failing now

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.480
it's not bad luck. It is incompetence

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.320
But the truth is

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.280
actually much more interesting than that

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.160
in my opinion, which is once you look at things

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720
once you take a bit of a step back

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.880
and start looking at things on a grander scale

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.560
there is another way in which Labour

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.680
actually have been unlucky

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.240
and what has happened is not Labour's fault

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.120
and that is the fact that this mistake

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.800
which has been made by Labour

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.400
which is neglecting to look at the wealth distribution

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.800
to think about changes in the wealth distribution

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.200
to worry about changes in who owns the assets

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.280
is not at all a mistake which is unique to Labour

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.560
I didn't just predict that Labour would be unpopular

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.400
I also predicted that Rishi Sunak would be unpopular

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.240
and I predicted Rishi Sunak would be unpopular

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.200
for the exact same reason that I predicted

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.320
Labour and Keir Starmer would be unpopular

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.400
so what you have here is two political parties

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.960
opposite sides of the political spectrum

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.520
making the exact same mistake

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.400
and I did a video earlier this year

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.920
might have been back end of last year

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.720
where I explained that Labour

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.720
and Donald Trump would both fail again

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.840
for the exact same reason

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.640
which is the exact same reason

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.520
failure to consider meaningfully

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.840
the wealth distribution

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.560
changing the wealth distribution

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.880
changing inequality.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.560
So what you have here is centre left Labour

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.640
centre right Conservatives, right

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.440
I guess you could even call it far right

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.400
Donald Trump. But it's not

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.920
it's not even just these parties

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.400
the Democrats made the same mistake under Joe Biden

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.320
Macron made the same mistake

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
in France

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.680
the centre left

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.360
and the centre right made the same mistakes

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.280
in Germany, in Italy

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.120
in Spain, in Japan

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.520
the governments making the same mistakes

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.680
So really

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.680
once you step back and you realize this mistake

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.080
which Labour is making

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.840
is the same mistake that the conservatives made

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.040
is the same mistake Trump is making

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040
is the same mistake

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.920
basically every established traditional political party

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.560
even new

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.680
political parties like Macron's party in France

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.720
When you realise these

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.920
all of these parties made the same mistake

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.480
you have to accept that really

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.680
what is happening here is not at all

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.480
in any way Labour's fault

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.520
in particular this is really quite obviously

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.240
not a failing and not a mistake specifically of Labour

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.200
but really of

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.360
of the broader western political class as a whole

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.120
and if you take a step back even further

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.760
it's even bigger than that

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.520
because this is not a case of the politicians failed

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.920
and for example

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.120
the economists were right or the journalists were right

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.360
or even the traders were right

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.920
you know at the beginning of Covid

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.240
because of my background as an inequality economist

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.200
I was able to recognize very quickly

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.400
that wealth inequality would increase a lot

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.440
and I was able to predict relatively easily

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.240
that we would see the things that we have seen.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.920
Big increase in asset prices

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.400
big inflation crisis, cost of living crisis

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.840
all of these things were predicted

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.760
If you don't believe it

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.560
you can go and watch our first video on the channel

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.120
in which all these things are predicted

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.960
but it wasn't just the politicians

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.000
who didn't really notice it at the time

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.440
basically nobody in the media was speaking about it

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.840
I didn't see almost anyone in academia

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.880
speaking about it, with maybe a few exceptions

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.320
and even the traders who I think I often talk about

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.000
as maybe being a little bit better informed

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.680
a little bit more on the ball than the academics

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.600
of the politicians

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.440
the vast majority of the traders didn't notice it

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.200
I've made a huge amount of money

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.520
betting on these things since the beginning of Covid

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.360
that wouldn't be possible if the traders knew

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.560
so this mistake, this

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.960
what I'm gonna call, naivety, about wealth

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.720
and naivety about wealth distribution and inequality

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.480
it's not just specific to Labour

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.280
It's basically

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.840
every established political party in the western world

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.720
and it's not even just unique to the political parties

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.760
this is basically a failure of understanding

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.920
of pretty much the entire western intellectual class

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.080
What is happening here economically

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.080
is not that complicated

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.880
the big picture story is all there.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.720
Government wealth has collapsed

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.240
that wealth has gone to the rich

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.680
the wealth of the richest has increased massively

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.760
You can see that

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.480
in the massive increase in stock prices

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.520
the massive increase in gold prices

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.840
the change in distribution is not that hard to see

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.760
if you look at it

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.160
Nothing really made it clearer than Covid

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.880
in Covid we had this

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.560
unbelievably clear example of a period where we were

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.040
obviously

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.640
going to pause the economy for a period of time

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.560
and massively increase inequality

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.360
Nothing could have been more obvious than the fact that

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.280
that would be immediately followed by a massive

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.840
fall in living standards for most people

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.080
This is not rocket science

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.880
if you massively change the distribution of wealth

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.080
that will be relatively quickly followed by a change

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.200
in the distribution of living standards

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.760
for relatively obvious reasons

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.880
and I think in my whole life

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.960
I'm 38 now

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.200
I've never seen anything as interesting really

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.240
or as amazing happen as the discourse

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.560
or perhaps it would be fair to say

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.160
the lack of a discourse

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.280
around the change in distribution during Covid

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.920
because if anybody had taken the time to consider

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.360
how will Covid change the distribution of wealth

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.760
anyone would have come to the conclusion

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.480
that Covid will massively increase

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.080
inequality of wealth and yet nobody had that discussion

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.200
so I often talk about the total amount 

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.240
of money given out by the UK government

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.280
since the beginning of Covid

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.520
which is over £1 trillion now, £20,000 per adult

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.640
the US number is over $13 trillion

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.960
we knew at the beginning of Covid these huge

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.880
huge huge

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.240
huge huge amounts of money were gonna be given out

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.080
which means that we knew with certainty that somebody

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120
some group in society

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.040
was gonna accumulate a huge amount of money

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.120
We knew

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.880
with certainty

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880
that the distribution of wealth would change

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.840
that the distribution

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.680
of living standards would change

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.200
and yet nobody

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.240
not Labour obviously

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.800
but also not the Conservatives

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.800
not the Democrats not the Republicans

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.440
not the centre left party where you live

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.040
not the centre right party where you live

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.160
not the academics, not the journalists

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.320
not the central bankers

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.520
not anybody, even ask the question of

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.800
where is this enormous amount of money gonna end up?

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.320
Who is gonna get richer? Who is gonna get poorer?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.920
How is that gonna affect living standards?

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.480
And it was so amazing that

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.160
I would say it verges on beautiful

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.000
and what that shows us is very

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.720
very clearly this problem is much

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.360
much bigger than Labour

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.400
It is a problem of the whole western intellectual class

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.720
I've often used in some of my interviews a metaphor

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.640
which I think really captures

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.160
really quite well what is happening here

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.080
which is I say we have an economy which has cancer

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.280
and we have a group of doctors

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.520
who do not believe in cancer

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.920
and I think that that really captures really

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.680
very nicely what's happening in the economy

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.240
because what you do have is a small group in society

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.200
really the problem is really the very rich

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.120
you know the top point one percent that are rapidly

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.120
rapidly increasing their wealth share

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.840
they're growing and they're growing

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.520
and they're growing and they're growing their wealth

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.240
and they're squeezing everybody else's wealth out

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.240
and that has really obvious consequences

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.680
the most obvious consequence is just that

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.440
other groups in society lose their wealth

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.600
and what we are seeing most sharply at the moment

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.960
is the loss in government wealth

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.120
and the consequence of the loss of government wealth

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.480
but we've also seen loss of

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.840
ability of ordinary people to

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.360
for example, own homes without taking big mortgages

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.440
massive increase in debt of ordinary families

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.800
what you're seeing is their wealth is increasing

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.720
everybody else's wealth is decreasing

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.040
and that is really

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.480
the primary cause of most of our economic problems

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.800
but most modern economists and politicians

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.720
and journalists simply do not think of the economy

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.760
in terms of distribution and inequality

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.400
and we'll discuss that more in this video

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.640
and in next week's video

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.960
but I want you to think now

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.800
what would it look like if you had an economy

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.480
that was being destroyed by growing inequality

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.320
and you had a political class and an economic class

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.160
which never ever considered the distribution

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.320
what you would have is

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.440
because of that inequality growing really

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.320
really quickly

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.840
you would constantly see bad consequences

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.280
affecting the economy

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.080
Things like unaffordable housing

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.360
things like unaffordable state services

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.320
things like government austerity

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360
these are all obvious things that would happen

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.640
as inequality increases. But if the political class

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.880
and the economic class wasn't able to recognize

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.800
that it was being caused by inequality

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.280
what they would see is we're doing everything right

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.240
and yet bad things keep happening

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.400
and we don't really understand why

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.840
We think what must be happening

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.400
is that we are just really

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.880
really consistently unlucky.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.240
Bad things keep happening

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.840
to the economy

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.680
it must be because of the Trump tariffs or

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.480
I think Jeremy Hunt spoke about the Ukraine war

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.520
or because of Covid or the aftermath of 2008

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.160
or the aftermath of the 2011 sovereign debt crisis

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.200
this is what you would expect to happen

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.680
if you were constantly misdiagnosing the problem

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.160
if you had a patient who had cancer

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.680
but you didn't know cancer exists

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.800
you'd tell them, you know, eat healthy

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.120
exercise, rest

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.520
drink water, and your patients would keep dying

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.720
because you haven't correctly identified the cause

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.600
So once we zoom out

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.000
and we recognise the problem for what it is

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.680
which is that

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.920
it wasn't really a problem of the Conservative Party

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.320
it isn't really a problem of Labour

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.520
it's not even a problem of Donald Trump

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.600
it is a problem of a failure to recognise the

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.800
correct cause of the problem

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.520
by the western intellectual class

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.520
that will probably feel initially

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.360
a little bit overwhelming, because

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:17.560
you know

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.640
when we had the Conservatives in this country

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.760
there was a big like let's keep the conservatives out

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.640
things will get better

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.200
and that feels achievable

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.440
it feels relatively easy

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:27.720
I mean

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.240
it was done, the Conservatives lost the election badly

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.040
they were kicked out

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.400
they're not in power anymore. 

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.560
Now we have Labour, they're unpopular

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.080
if the problem is Labour, we kick Labour out

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.120
we're gonna fix the problem

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.640
if the problem was

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.520
isolated to one specific political party

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.720
it would be relatively easy to solve

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.320
by kicking that political party out

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.040
if the problem is a failure of the entire western

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.520
intellectual class to correctly identify

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.280
what is causing falling living standards

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.680
that feels a lot bigger and that feels a lot scarier

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.760
and it feels a lot less easy to resolve

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.600
but actually in many ways

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.520
it is a massive massive source of opportunity

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.280
because I think it is become increasingly clear that

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.000
in many ways and in many countries across the world

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.320
the public is starting to recognize this fact

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.600
which is that the problem is really a broad problem

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.960
of the political class, intellectual class

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.600
just not really understanding what's happening

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.560
and what that is doing is creating this massive

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.600
massive demand for new ideas

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.840
and this enormous space is opening up

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.000
and this enormous demand is opening up from the public

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.120
not just here in the UK

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.640
but across the world for new ideas

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.560
different ways of thinking

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.400
different ways of managing the economy

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.000
and it creates this massive

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.600
massive opportunity to do something new

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.920
to do something different

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.960
and I think that is one of the reasons why

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.520
like amazing things can happen

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.480
like me and Jack

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.600
sitting here in my kitchen

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.120
can have a political show

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.400
that is basically

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.240
the biggest political show in the entire country

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.840
you know, because there is this massive

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.440
massive demand for new ideas

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.000
in politics

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.240
and it means that the the opportunities are are really

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.240
really huge. And I'm often reminded

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.360
I'm trying to get more medieval history

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.320
into these videos

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.840
this reminds me of, you're gonna like this one

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.520
the collapse of the Roman Empire

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.560
So the Roman Empire

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.280
obviously is a massive empire in early medieval Europe

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.240
and there was another massive empire in Asia at the time

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.360
the Persian Empire

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.360
and they fought each other

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.880
loads and loads and loads and loads and loads

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.120
until they exhausted each other

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.760
and then what you saw was this massive expansion of

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.800
in the north

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.760
German tribes who were considered like very

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.000
very weak, not powerful, divided

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.840
and in the South, Arabian

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.680
Muslim tribes

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.800
who were considered like very weak and not powerful

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.440
suddenly expanded and took over

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.680
basically the whole of Europe

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.560
the whole of North Africa

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.400
the whole of the Middle East

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.960
like totally conquered this enormous space

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.680
from these massive massive empires

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.520
and that was basically what happened

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.960
When the big existing powers fail

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.840
it creates this enormous vacuum

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.800
for new ideas to come in and take the space

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.680
and I think that is basically where we are now

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.440
There was a book written by, is it Francis Fukuyama?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.400
End of History in, I think the 90s

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.360
where he spoke about, once communism collapsed

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.320
that basically we were at the end of history

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.520
and we had figured out

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.120
what the best way to run the world was

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.000
and it was capitalism

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.280
and it was this new kind of modern economic management

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.400
and that's it we're done now

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.280
we figured it out, nothing ever has to change

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.320
and now we are at the kind of the end of

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.920
the end of history where suddenly

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.880
we have realised that the ideas of the western

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.640
intellectual class have failed

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.000
and there is this massive

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.720
massive demand from your ordinary people on the street

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.280
here in London here in the UK

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.400
across the world for something

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.720
new, something different

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.080
and it is this massive massive

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.200
massive opportunity to establish really

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.960
what will be the economic ideas

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.920
on which the future of this country

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.640
the future of the world will be run

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.600
and that is there to win

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.440
that is there to win basically

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.720
and that is why you know

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.120
often even though it can be depressing

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.320
to look at the falling living standards

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.880
and I think things will get worse

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.240
I get kind of excited really here doing this channel

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.080
because I know that the world is gonna change

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.320
the new economic ideas are gonna be built

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.960
and we have an opportunity here to build a new economy

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.000
that is based on relatively simple ideas

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.880
such as, it is important to prevent wealth and power

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
from being monopolized by a tiny elite

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.640
we need to protect the wealth

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.480
and the power of ordinary people

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.880
we need to protect wealth holdings of regular families

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.400
of government and what I think is really

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.640
really interesting is you say this here and now

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.840
this sounds like a really

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.200
really new idea but if you go and look upon

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.640
like the sort of

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.000
founding principles of the United States of America

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.840
one of the big principles there was

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.360
we need to make sure we have division

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.840
and separation of powers

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.120
to prevent power from being concentrated

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.840
to prevent power from being accumulated

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.600
and this was a big idea that existed

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.560
in the early United States

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.840
because people had come from a Europe

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.880
which was being destroyed by massive inequality

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.320
so it's been done before we can do it again

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.200
the opportunity is absolutely massive

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.080
all we need to do is convince somehow

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.640
the western intellectual class

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.200
just to understand

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.360
the reason living standards are falling

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.760
is growing inequality

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.240
if you do not stop inequality from increasing

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.520
living standards will continue to fall

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.280
That simple understanding

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.400
can stop living standards from falling

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.120
and can save the world. But unfortunately

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.840
we are, we're not quite there yet

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.960
at the moment we're at an interesting space here

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.200
where on this channel, we've really

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.040
I think

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.640
we've done a really great job of educating the public

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.160
and I'm really proud of what we've done

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.120
but we have repeatedly failed to win over basically

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.840
these intellectual elites

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.640
and what that has meant really

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.840
is that the intellectual elites

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.800
are collapsing in popularity

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.480
and it is leading to this massive

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.440
surge in popularity of the far right

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.440
and I think that is, really on this channel

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.880
we've had a massive success

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.440
sort of building a political movement

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.600
but I think where we have failed

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.120
is in really establishing this intellectual movement

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.240
which is getting people to understand

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.240
this just simple economic idea

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.800
that if you allow wealth

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.480
inequality to grow very quickly

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.920
living standards will fall

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.040
and I'm constantly reminded when I do this channel

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.200
of my time at Oxford

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.600
So people who don't know

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.080
I actually quit finance in 2014

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.560
and I tried loads of different things before

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.720
I started this channel in 2020

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.920
including a two year masters at Oxford University

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.520
and I turned up at Oxford

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.280
like perhaps quite naively

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.640
having been a very successful trader

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.760
trading interest rates

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.080
thinking I could talk to the professor at Oxford saying

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.200
look you know

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.000
you've got a very bad track record

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.560
of understanding interest rates

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.000
you know we can talk about why

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.760
I've made loads of money doing this

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.400
you can make loads of money doing this

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.840
I can show you the data, I can explain it to you

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.280
and basically these guys had had totally no interest

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.920
and that reminds me of

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.640
where we are now basically

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:22.880
which is

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.560
you have this really interesting situation here

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.360
in this country

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.840
of a Labour Party that is desperately in need of money

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.680
desperately unpopular

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.400
desperately in need of more social media reach

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.960
and we turn up with a really

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.200
really popular

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.960
money raising idea with loads of social media reach

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.800
and we say 

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.480
do you want to do it and

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.000
they for some reason have

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.840
have no interest

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.880
and it really reminds me of

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.960
of this

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.000
this situation

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.360
this stubborn unwillingness of the intellectual class

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.200
to basically accept or even really countenance

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.360
the idea that they might be wrong

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.280
on the big ideas about the economy.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.040
So the message is clear

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.480
I think the problem is actually shockingly simple

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.920
and it goes way

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.040
way beyond just Labour or just Donald Trump

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.880
or just the Conservative Party or the Democrats

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.440
or whoever the party, parties are

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.280
where you are

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.000
there is a relatively simple problem of understanding

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.240
in our western intellectual classes about the economy

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.920
they're very naive about the wealth distribution

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.360
about wealth in general. They tend not to look at it

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.680
they tend not to think about it

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.080
and as a result they have allowed

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.360
and are allowing

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.840
the wealth distribution to become very unequal

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.960
if we don't do anything about that

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.880
living standards will fall further and further

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.480
and further and further. That will create

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.440
and is creating massive demand for new politics

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.400
new politicians and until

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.520
and unless

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.320
the western intellectual class is willing to adapt

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.480
willing to change or the political left is able to

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.120
to build something powerful and popular

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.800
this will inevitably go the way of the far right

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.040
and as living standards fall

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.920
and fall and fall

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.800
I suspect it will end up in a situation of

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.680
in the end very extreme poverty and

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.440
and relatively extreme fascism

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.320
so on that very optimistic message, what do you do?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.160
So last week, or is it two weeks ago now

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.160
two weeks ago I split my my message into two messages

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.360
and one was to people who don't want Reform to win

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.000
and one was to people who do want Reform to win

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
so today I'm gonna again split my message into two

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.320
which is one message to the public

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.520
and one message to people who are in

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.040
or might be able to get into this kind of

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.960
intellectual elite. So people who have

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.360
can get university degrees and get fancy jobs in

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.280
in universities or government

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.880
or political parties or the media

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.480
So to the public what I wanna say is

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.800
you need to understand this problem

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.640
I know if you haven't gone to an elite university

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.920
if you haven't studied economics

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.440
you you might be used to being told

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.080
this is a problem for experts

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.320
this is a problem for intellectuals

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.240
this is not a problem for you. If this is not fixed

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.920
your living standards will collapse

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.560
and the intellectuals are not gonna fix it for you

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.760
don't be ashamed into silence

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.520
understand it, the public

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.240
is desperate for a new vision for the future

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.760
and in the absence of leadership from the

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760
political elite and the intellectual elite

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.440
you have a massive opportunity to fill that gap

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.040
I've spoken before on this channel

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.760
about the importance of citizen journalists

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.960
ordinary people, conversations between ordinary people

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.440
the economy is gonna change massively

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.360
the emperor has got no clothes

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.080
everybody knows the existing political class

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.160
the existing intellectual class has failed

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.760
but the new future is yet to be built

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.720
the future is there to be built and to be fought for

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.680
you need to build it, understand the simple problem

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.040
the reason that living standards are falling

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.200
is because of growing inequality of wealth

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.040
if nothing is done about growing inequality of wealth

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.880
living standards will fall further

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.720
the only way to fix that

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.400
is to fix an unfair tax system

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.560
understand that yourself and be ready to push for that

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.720
for a long time the existing elites have failed

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.240
the space is there to be won, win it okay

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.440
and now to the existing intellectual class

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.920
people who might have fancy jobs

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.800
fancy names, come from fancier places than me

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.880
listen

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.720
I know we maybe don't come from the same background

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.080
and I know when you see somebody like me

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.880
who maybe didn't come through the right channels in

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.080
in the way you see it or

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.280
or doesn't speak the right way

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.280
or maybe you feel speaks disrespectfully

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.720
and maybe you feel

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.800
criticizes your group and your group's understanding

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.320
you can get mad I understand that

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.920
and I know

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.800
you might have invested a lot of your self worth

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.400
and your belief

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.440
in the understanding that your class is good

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.720
and your class has good understanding

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.520
if you are not willing to be flexible

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.080
and change your ideas about the economy

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.720
and about the way to run this country

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.400
I guarantee you

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.480
living standards will continue to collapse

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.920
and you will be displaced by the far right

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.360
I guarantee you that will happen

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.560
I'm betting on it every year and I'll be right

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.760
you must be willing to bend or you will be broken

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.480
not by me but by the far right

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.160
you will be displaced, that is what will happen

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.160
if you are not willing to be open minded

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.680
about the causes of falling living standards

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.080
OK I know when you see me and when you hear me

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.040
you think this is some crazy working class

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.960
left wing guy

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.200
you think I'm like Lenin or Trotsky or something

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.760
I've got the qualifications okay

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.520
I've been to the best universities in the world

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.040
I was one of the best traders in the world

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.360
one of the biggest banks in the world

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.640
I've been predicting this correctly

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.880
from the very beginning

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.640
go and look at those predictions

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.720
go and watch my video from the beginning

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.240
read my article in the Guardian June 2020

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.400
I've been predicting this right from the start

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.480
I've been betting on this right since 2011

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.840
I have a very very

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.480
very good track record here

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.760
you guys are comfortable

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.880
you get paid well

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.200
you have a good situation in today's society

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.080
if you are not willing to countenance

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.240
the fact that inequality could be driving

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.440
falling living standards

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.880
living standards will continue to collapse

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.560
and you will be displaced

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.200
open your mind, open your eyes

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.720
or you will lose your comfortable positions, okay

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.920
So to conclude

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.400
what we have right now is not a Labour Party problem

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.240
it is a much much bigger problem than the Labour Party

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.480
it's basically happening to every

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.880
single political party in the western world

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.200
so it's obviously much

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.000
much bigger than the Labour Party

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.520
I'm not saying that to defend the Labour Party

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.320
I'm not saying that to protect the Labour Party

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.960
I think the Labour Party has done a bad job

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.520
but I am not at all disappointed with the Labour Party

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.320
because I knew exactly that this is what they would do

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.360
it's exactly what I predicted that they would do

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.000
it's what I bet they would do

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.760
but it's important that you understand

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.960
accurately what is happening

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.320
otherwise you will make the same mistake

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.960
that the Labour Party is making

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.480
The Labour Party's basic mistake

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.440
is an incorrect diagnosis of the cause of the problem

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.360
they think that the problem is

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.360
I don't know, a lack of productivity

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.280
incompetence from the Conservatives

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.160
they think they can sensible their way out of it

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.080
and they can't

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.680
that is because they don't understand

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.240
what is really happening

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.720
if you don't understand what's happening

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.960
you will also make a bad diagnosis

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.840
a classic example of that was two years ago

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.840
everybody thought the Conservatives were the problem

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.840
they thought if we kick the Conservatives out

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.640
things will get better

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.200
they did kick the conservatives out

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.720
things won't get better, the same thing is happening now

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.520
everybody thinks Labour are the problem

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.120
they think if they kick Labour out and get Reform in

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.040
things will get better and again

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.360
it will not work, you need to understand correctly

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.560
the cause of the problem

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.360
it is growing wealth inequality

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.960
and you need to drive that into the political narrative

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.360
so that is it basically

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.280
what I want you to do is to understand

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.200
build that understanding as much as you can

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.640
build that understanding every single day

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.360
with your friends with your communities

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.160
simple nice and simple

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.040
the reason living standards are falling

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.640
is because of growing inequality

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.360
if you don't stop growing inequality

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.160
living standards will continue to fall

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.920
listen, Labour will get more and more

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.440
and more and more unpopular

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.600
until and unless they accept that

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.080
and if they lose and Reform come in

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.440
I guarantee you Reform will fail

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.680
and become more and more and more unpopular

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.680
Until and unless they accept that

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.000
the space will open up

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.880
more and more and more for this idea to come

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.000
so that's it

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.560
build that understanding in your communities

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.000
use our videos

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
but also if you can throw yourself into it

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.080
we need to get ourselves into

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.520
those intellectual classes

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.200
if you

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.760
or your kids or your friends are able to get jobs

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.760
as academics, as economists

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.440
in the media, in government

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.760
in civil service

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.480
go and get those jobs

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.240
and drive these ideas into the narrative

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.400
until people accept and understand

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.280
that the cause of the problem is inequality

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.920
things are gonna get worse and worse

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.520
but ultimately

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.600
understanding itself is not gonna be enough

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.440
we do need to get these ideas into policy and

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.000
ultimately that's gonna mean

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.200
both in this country or wherever you are

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.800
that we do need to somehow break into government

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.560
and in this country

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.680
that means either influencing the Labour Party

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.000
or replacing them somehow and

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.920
that is what we're gonna discuss in next week's video

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.520
which is gonna be one of the last in the series

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.200
the big question, can Labour be saved?

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.440
Thank you very much. Tax wealth not work, thank you
