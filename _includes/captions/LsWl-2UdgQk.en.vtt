00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
the truth of the situation is your kids and&nbsp;
your grandkids are not going to be all right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.400
they're not like most young people in this&nbsp;
country will will live lives of of relatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.200
severe poverty that's the way we're going and&nbsp;
that's like the future and you know your kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.680
and your grandkids will probably be poor or very&nbsp;
poor that's the way this country is going right

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
okay there's a few things i would like&nbsp;
to say about this the first thing is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.520
yeah... i'm not... that old... yet myself&nbsp;
i'm very very aware that um it's often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.960
that the poor that are... sorry not poor&nbsp;
the young that are being put in like a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.360
difficult situation here so like if you take&nbsp;
even my family um we're always a poor family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.960
but my parents you know were very thrifty&nbsp;
and they you know they lived like a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.720
basic life their whole life and they saved up&nbsp;
everything they could and now they basically own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.360
their property without a mortgage you know they're&nbsp;
in their 60s now um and my dad's got a pension so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.040
even though they've been like low income their&nbsp;
whole lives that and my mom didn't work for most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.200
of her life they are now able to live like you&nbsp;
know they still live like a they don't live a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
life of luxury by any means right but they're able&nbsp;
they're comfortable they're financially secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.720
um and that's you know they don't have any&nbsp;
university degrees or any special qualifications&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.520
just with one parent working they've been able&nbsp;
to do that and the young people don't have that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.600
security right so like my sister she works way&nbsp;
harder than my parents ever worked and she's got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.080
like two degrees and she's like struggling to&nbsp;
get by sometimes right so i think that really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.200
captures like what's changed in generations um&nbsp;
so i'm totally totally aware and i talk about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.880
lot of how difficult the situation is for young&nbsp;
people now and how important it is that we find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.600
ways to communicate to older people right because&nbsp;
we have this a voting division in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.120
where a lot of older people vote&nbsp;
for this conservative government um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.880
which means that to some degree they're happy&nbsp;
with the way things are going and that's because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.080
i think they're they're a little bit lied to&nbsp;
you by the media saying oh if your kids stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.240
buying avocado toast they're going to be all&nbsp;
right the truth of the situation is your kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.800
and your grandkids are not going to be all right&nbsp;
they're not like most young people in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120
will live lives of of relatively severe poverty&nbsp;
that's the way we're going and that's like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.480
future and you know your kids and your grandkids&nbsp;
will probably be poor or very poor that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.440
way this country is going right and i think if&nbsp;
older people knew that they wouldn't accept it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.000
so on the one hand like i totally understand&nbsp;
that what we are building here is a system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.280
which hits the youngest worst and protects&nbsp;
often old but you need to add look there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.640
a lot of very poor old people in this country so&nbsp;
we shouldn't we shouldn't be just like young old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.760
you know what i mean um but not only that&nbsp;
like if we allow that to become a division&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.360
and especially if we allow likes to some degree&nbsp;
of hatred to fester in that division if we allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.320
young people to get angry and to hate the old&nbsp;
then that will become a division which prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.800
all of the ordinary people of this country from&nbsp;
coming together to push them back and i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.720
that that is what that is what the billionaires&nbsp;
want right they want us to fight each other and be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.360
angry at each other because if we were not angry&nbsp;
at each other then we would point out the true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.760
villains here who are destroying our lives and our&nbsp;
economy which is the super rich so um of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.360
like young people have my sympathy and this this&nbsp;
channel is often primarily targeting young people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.560
but it's very very very important that we do not&nbsp;
exclude or fight against older people and in fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.480
the big part of what we have to do is to learn how&nbsp;
if you're young learn how to communicate to older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.520
people who are close to you like your parents&nbsp;
or your grandparents your friends parents your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.520
friends grandparents what is happening to your&nbsp;
generation and explain to them look this is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.840
about us being profligate it's not about being&nbsp;
idiots who spend all our money on cappuccinos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.560
you know our lives are being destroyed our&nbsp;
futures are being destroyed because if the older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.240
generation knew that you know they want futures&nbsp;
for their kids and their grandkids and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.040
there's real potential there to build a&nbsp;
connection so i see it in the media like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.240
the another story that was out this week was um&nbsp;
oh pensioners are having their incomes protected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.840
while ordinary workers are being screwed okay&nbsp;
and be that as it may you know that might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920
true to a degree but you know prices are going&nbsp;
up ten percent almost everyone's being screwed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.360
and what they want is is us to fight each other&nbsp;
like cats in a bag you know what i mean because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.240
while that is happening the fastest ever increase&nbsp;
in millionaire and billionaire wealth in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.360
country ever in the history of this country it's&nbsp;
obvious where we need to get the money from and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.760
if they can get us as poor and ordinary people to&nbsp;
fight each other then they can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rob us blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.960
while we're doing that so it's very very important&nbsp;
that we do not accept any level of division&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.080
be that based on age be that based on ethnicity&nbsp;
be that based on whether you're from the north or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.560
from the south be that based on gender we cannot&nbsp;
accept those divisions because those are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.440
divisions that ultimately are going to keep all&nbsp;
of us poor and drive us all further into poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.040
so like the way i see it you have to build bridges&nbsp;
amongst ordinary working people because that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.720
the only power that ordinary people have&nbsp;
the only power is that there's more of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.840
and if they start fighting each other instead of&nbsp;
fighting the rich then they lose the only power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.920
they have which means they will lose which means&nbsp;
they'll lose their houses which means they will go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.880
get driven further but they're in the poverty&nbsp;
so for me whenever i hear anything about all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.600
the young are getting here the older getting&nbsp;
protected blah blah blah listen i understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.200
listen a lot of people are getting hit here and&nbsp;
some people are getting hit worse than others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.320
but we need each other you know i mean you&nbsp;
know we can fight ourselves and we can fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.480
each other until the till the lifeboat rolls&nbsp;
over it doesn't help anybody you know i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.880
like people need to find ways to build&nbsp;
bridges and unite across division&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.560
and um yeah i think that's important so um and&nbsp;
you know we have younger and older viewers on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.720
channel and um you know we have men and we have&nbsp;
women and we have people of all different races&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:05.840
and ethnicities and that's what we will need&nbsp;
so it's very important that we stick with that
