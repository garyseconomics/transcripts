00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.320
we do need to see in a moderation&nbsp;
of wage rises now that's painful

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.920
okay we've got to talk about inflation

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.960
food prices are going up energy prices are going&nbsp;
up house prices are going up the rent is going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.360
everything's going up except for your wages and&nbsp;
andrew bailey the governor of the bank of england&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.960
who earns half a million pounds a year&nbsp;
by the way is telling you not to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.640
for a pay rise you need to understand&nbsp;
what is happening here with inflation

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.360
okay the first thing you need to understand is&nbsp;
that the mainstream media has no idea what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.600
causing this inflation they're talking about it&nbsp;
as if it's some sort of natural disaster that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.120
just dropped on the country a cost of living&nbsp;
crisis listen this inflation crisis was easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.520
predictable right at the beginning of colvin and&nbsp;
in fact i predicted it in my very first video on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320
this channel look covert was the biggest economic&nbsp;
disaster for a hundred years since the great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.920
depression and how did we deal with it well the&nbsp;
government just simply printed £45 billion 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.000
okay that's £10000  for every single adult&nbsp;
in the country okay and if you're not sitting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.880
ten thousand pounds more in your bank account now&nbsp;
than you were before colby or someone else has got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.360
your £10000 and the facts are they probably&nbsp;
do because all the statistics show us that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.600
vast amount of that money was accumulated by the&nbsp;
very richest people in the country that means the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.600
richest people in the country stacking up 60 70 80&nbsp;
£100,000 more than they had before covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.040
okay look if that's how you deal with&nbsp;
the disaster then you can't be surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.760
when prices go up these guys are sitting&nbsp;
on 70 80 100 000 pounds more cash okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.440
that means when your kids go to buy a house&nbsp;
they're competing against these kids who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.960
a hundred two hundred thousand pounds more&nbsp;
cash in the bank of course prices are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.360
to go up these guys have a huge amount of cash and&nbsp;
they're going to use it to push up the prices of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.640
food energy houses that you your families and your&nbsp;
kids need okay and that is not going to get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.840
unless we do something about the huge amount of&nbsp;
cash stacking up in rich people's bank accounts

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.280
is the government going to do anything about&nbsp;
it well when you consider that the chancellor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.720
father-in-law is a billionaire and he himself&nbsp;
is worth an estimated 200 million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.640
i suspect he's probably pretty happy about&nbsp;
the fact that millionaires and billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.960
in this country made a bigger increase on their&nbsp;
wealth during the first year of colvin than they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.840
ever have gotten in any other year in the&nbsp;
history of this country has he raised taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.840
on those people well actually he's raised taxes by&nbsp;
two and a half percent on you and your wages and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.320
he's done it in such a way that it specifically&nbsp;
excludes the incomes of billionaires i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.840
think he's going to fix his crisis of inequality&nbsp;
and for that reason things are going to get worse

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.000
okay so what are the economists who as always have&nbsp;
no idea what they're doing going to do instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.560
taxing their rich well it looks like they're&nbsp;
going to and in fact they've already started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.640
raising interest rates what does that mean that&nbsp;
means people who have debts are going to pay more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.880
money to people who have savings okay well who&nbsp;
has debts well if you've got a mortgage it's you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.840
and if you are the government who borrowed&nbsp;
a massive amount during kovitz it's you as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.880
well which means the taxpayer the homeowners and&nbsp;
the taxpayers are going to pay more money to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.160
cash holders and who are the cash holders here&nbsp;
as we've said it's the rich and the very rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.760
these guys are gonna try and fix the&nbsp;
crisis by making you and your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.520
pay more money to the rich do you&nbsp;
think that's gonna work i don't

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.600
okay so what happens next the amount of&nbsp;
money in society has permanently increased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.480
that means prices need to permanently increase but&nbsp;
money is no longer pouring in so eventually prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.160
will stabilize that means inflation will come&nbsp;
back down does that mean the problem is fixed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.000
no inflation will come back to normal but prices&nbsp;
will stay permanently higher permanently higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.320
cost of food permanently higher cost of&nbsp;
energy permanently higher cost of rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.720
permanently higher cost of housing the only price&nbsp;
which is not going to become permanently higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.920
is your wage that's what happens when the&nbsp;
rich get richer but ordinary people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.760
your quality of life decreases permanently that's&nbsp;
you and your family the rich will be permanently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.160
richer ordinary people be permanently poorer&nbsp;
and quality of life we permanently decrease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.480
we have to do something about this

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.960
okay so what do we do number one educate&nbsp;
yourselves and understand what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.840
don't let them call this a cost of living crisis&nbsp;
like it's some sort of natural disaster understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.240
that this is being caused by our government&nbsp;
using the kovitz crisis to allow millionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.720
and billionaires to accumulate literally&nbsp;
hundreds of billions of pounds at your expense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.000
understand that we can't fix it unless we get&nbsp;
that money back watch the first video on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
channel which explains clearly how that happened&nbsp;
number two is push back don't let andrew bailey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.800
tell you that you don't deserve a pay rise push&nbsp;
for higher wages for you and your work colleagues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.520
don't let billionaire rishi sunac raise your&nbsp;
taxes on you and your family and not raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.640
taxes on billionaires push for higher taxes on&nbsp;
millionaires and billionaires and lower taxes on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.320
ordinary working people and number three is spread&nbsp;
this message share this video with your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.200
your family or work colleagues look there's a&nbsp;
fight going on here and the super rich are winning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.320
the only way we are gonna fight this&nbsp;
is if we come together to push back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:51.840
okay well i'm here to do my grocery&nbsp;
shopping if i can afford it keep watching

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.680
so it's intentionally designed national&nbsp;
insurance so that very rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.320
pay a very low percent there is one other thing&nbsp;
they can do with that mass amount of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.200
they can buy your mom's house
