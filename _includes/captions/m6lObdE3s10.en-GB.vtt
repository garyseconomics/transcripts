00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Okay.

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome back to today's special bonus

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.800
edition of Gary's Economics,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.600
where we are going to talk about truth, lies and games.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.480
Okay, so today is the 30th of January,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.840
which means it is the release

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.760
of the paperback of my book,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.560
this, new paperback version. It's much cheaper.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.640
I think it's about £10, something like that.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.920
And to commemorate the release of the paperback,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.960
I wanted to do an edition

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
where I speak about a story

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.720
that happened to me when I was a trader,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.240
which I write about in the book,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.880
which really helped me to understand, in my mind,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.200
Donald Trump during the last Donald Trump presidency.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.920
So obviously Donald Trump is back.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.880
And I wanted to share a story

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
from the book which helped me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.680
think about it, deal with it, and understand it.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.760
Okay, so towards the end of my time at Citibank,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000
I decided I wanted to leave.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.080
And, the opening scene of my book is,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.640
my boss at the time, basically, pretty strongly

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.800
threatening me that,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.160
I could get in quite a lot of trouble

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.520
if I tried to leave the bank.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.600
That led to the beginning

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
of kind of a crazy period in my life

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.640
where I was quite frequently

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.920
threatened by senior management at Citibank.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.680
And I entered this period at work,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
which I call the meeting period,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.320
which was where

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.040
for about 3 or 4 weeks,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.160
every single day,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
I would have 2 or 3 or 4 meetings

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.520
with senior management at Citibank.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.720
And at the time I was living in Tokyo,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.800
working in Tokyo, in Japan.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
And Citibank is obviously

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.320
a massive, massive, massive organisation.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.600
And there's all these different members

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.440
of senior management.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.840
And every meeting

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.240
would have like, a different combination

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.000
of bank senior managers in the meeting.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So one day might be a one-on-one

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.800
with a specific manager in Tokyo.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.280
And then the next meeting might be four guys,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.880
one in New York, one in London,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.960
one in Tokyo, one in Singapore.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.760
Then there might be a big zoom call with like ten guys.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.440
And each one of these meetings...

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.880
what was interesting about these meetings was

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.680
each one of these meetings,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.360
the management would have basically

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
a different kind of strategy

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.160
of what we're going to do in this meeting.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400
So you might, for example,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720
have a good cop, bad cop meeting.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.880
So for those who don't know,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.560
you're meeting with two guys

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.720
and one of them just like shouts in your face.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.280
And then he takes breaks and the other guy

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680
says, listen,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360
I want to help you, I want to be on your side,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.040
I want to deal with this.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.480
But then you might have another meeting

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360
where you just have

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.800
6, 7 top senior management,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.400
and beforehand they've decided with each other,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.040
what we're going to do

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
is we're just going to be really,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.640
really supportive to Gary.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520
We're going to tell him we're behind him.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.320
So you would have this like

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.480
really weird combination

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.920
of, you go into to one meeting

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.520
and a guy would, like, scream in your face for an hour

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.480
and you go into the next meeting.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.440
Sometimes these meetings

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.040
could be like even directly back

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.080
to back in the same kind of like zoom office room.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.800
And everyone would be like,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.320
we love you, we support you.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.040
And, sometimes you would get this amazing situation

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.800
where the same guy

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.080
who had just been shouting you for an hour

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.520
was also scheduled to be in the next meeting,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.400
which was immediately afterwards.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.440
So you'd have a guy stop shouting at you,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.960
sit down,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.160
turn on this like zoom call on the big screen.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.320
And one by one, everyone, including him, would say,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.440
we believe in you, you know, we’re really behind you,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.480
we really support you.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.960
And,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.680
you know, when I told Jack about this earlier,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.960
he said, oh it must have made you go mad.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.480
But actually, these little weird features

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.080
were kind of what kept me sane in the period

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.400
because they were so funny.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.640
It was so funny to see this guy

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.120
immediately switch from being like,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.360
like a crazy animal,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.120
just shouting at you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.080
to being like a kind of cuddly teddy bear.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.760
Just because he's turned a zoom call on

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.800
and it's a different meeting.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.640
And what this made me realise,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.600
and it wasn't just this,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.520
it was a lot of things when I was working at Citibank,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.880
is that

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.320
rich and powerful people

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.040
have quite a different attitude and approach to truth

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.040
and lies and games compared to ordinary people.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.800
So I think most ordinary people,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.920
when they are having a conversation with somebody,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.520
there is a kind of assumption

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.840
that if you say something, it is because you

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.880
believe it,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.920
and it is because you think it,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.840
it is because you feel it.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.640
That is why you say things.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.680
And there's a kind of assumption

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.520
that people say things because they're true

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.240
or it's what they think.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.240
But a lot of rich people and a lot of powerful people,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.560
they don't

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960
approach their conversations in this way,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.600
especially if it is conversations

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.680
which have any relationship

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.720
with money or power or their work.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.960
They will often go into

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960
a conversation with a kind of a game playing mentality,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.480
which is what is our objective from this conversation?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.960
What is our objective from this meeting?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.360
So in the case of the story in my book,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.240
they didn't want me to quit.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.600
So it's like,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600
what is our strategy

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.880
to stop Gary from quitting basically.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.600
And then you'll go in basically

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.160
playing a character and trying to think, what is the...

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.440
what do I need to say

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.200
in order to get the things that I want?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.720
What is the optimal choice of words, choice of strategy

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.120
to try and get the outcome that I want?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.360
And because I spent a lot of time at Citibank,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.240
working with very rich, very powerful people,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.200
you start to realise that this is a very normal way

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.440
of interacting,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.560
of human interactions

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.400
in this world of rich and powerful people.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.000
And for that reason,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.680
when Donald Trump came into power,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.480
I was not really surprised at all

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.720
by the way,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.000
the things that he said and the way that he behaved.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.360
So Donald Trump

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.760
and of course, you've also got Elon Musk

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.360
now in this new administration.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.640
They both tend to do this thing

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.320
of saying an awful lot of things.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.360
They say, we're going to do this.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.120
They say we're going to do that.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.040
And sometimes the things that they say seem crazy.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.200
And you get people in the media saying,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.280
oh my God, if they do that policy,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.320
how is it going to affect us?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.960
What's it going to do?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.000
And then what you would often

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600
find in the last administration is

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.160
he would say, we're going to do this thing.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.000
And then nothing would come of it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.680
There would never be any actual policy

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.040
or ever even any attempt at a policy. And this

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.960
confused people because a lot of people assumed

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.760
that if somebody like Donald Trump says,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.880
I want to do this thing, or I'm going to do this thing

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.160
that means that he wants to do this thing,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.560
or he's going to do that thing.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.120
But from somebody who's

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.880
been in these meetings

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.240
and seen how people basically say

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.120
whatever they think works in that specific meeting,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.160
I was not surprised at all, really.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.080
This is a very, very common way

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.720
of rich and powerful people behaving.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.040
So what that means is we shouldn't really read anything

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.960
in terms of what rich or powerful people

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.280
actually say, or actually want,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.240
or actually are going to do from what they say

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.000
they want, or what they say they're going to do.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.600
When people...

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.640
when rich and powerful people say something

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.800
really more than anything,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.200
it tells us something about what

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.320
they want us to believe.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.560
And this also explains often why

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.600
what people say is so at odds with what they do.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.240
For example,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.880
you've got the Conservatives

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.480
who continually said

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.440
they were anti-migration and yet enormously increased

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.520
the number of legal migration into the country.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.720
You have Elon Musk,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.760
who again, is trying to fund anti-immigration parties

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.200
and yet is trying to increase

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.440
immigration of many kinds into the US.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.280
When these rich and powerful people speak,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.360
we should always be asking us

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.560
fundamentally, at the very heart,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.440
what do these people want?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.720
And in the vast majority of cases,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.040
what rich and powerful people want

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.760
is more wealth, more power,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.160
not just for them, but also for their kids.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.360
So a few years ago,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.360
when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.400
I won't lie, I was surprised.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
I'm not a Putin expert,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.960
and I was surprised he did that

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.000
because I thought immediately,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.680
he's already super rich, he's already super powerful,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.560
that jeopardises

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.800
his situation, it jeopardises his future.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.440
Why would he do that?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.360
And the first thing I did was

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.880
I went onto Wikipedia, I looked up Vladimir Putin.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.240
I wanted to know how old he was.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.480
Does he have any kids? Does he have any sons?

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.800
And that is because I understand that most

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.720
elderly, wealthy, powerful

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.760
men are primarily concerned

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.000
with successfully transferring their wealth

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.640
and their power to their kids

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.120
and in many cases,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.720
they're focused on getting it to their sons

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.600
or one particular son.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.760
And I think this is

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.080
the way that you can primarily understand

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.000
people like Musk, people like Putin, people like Trump.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.720
You need to understand their motivations.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.280
What do they want? What do they want?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.160
What do they want?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.360
And of course, everyone is an individual

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.440
and people want different things

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.520
and you can't perfectly know what Putin wants.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.960
We can't perfectly know what Trump wants.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960
We can't perfectly know what Musk wants.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.360
But most of the time

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.080
it is about amassing further wealth and power

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.000
for themselves, for their kids.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.600
You know, they always say in football,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.960
you know, don’t watch the man

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.760
watch the ball

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.520
because he's going to throw all kinds of feints.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.160
Pretend he's going to be this way,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.160
pretend he's going to go that way.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.080
Ultimately, he wants to get the ball into the goal

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.440
and most of the time, getting the ball into the goal

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.520
means getting more money, getting more wealth.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520
And I wanted to say like, this is not...

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.480
if you want to understand,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.560
I spoke to a friend about this

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.320
and he said, you know, I can't really understand

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.520
this way of being, where you’ll basically say anything

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.080
if you think is going to get you what you want,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.200
because most people don't do that.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.000
But the truth is,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.600
when you are in a game situation, this often happens.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.960
I was around a friend's house

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.960
playing Catan a couple of months ago.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.160
Good friends house, I’m good friends

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.000
with both her and her husband.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.600
And her husband was trying to do this trade with me.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.360
And he said, look, I'll trade this with you.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.120
And I said, no.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.880
And he said, listen, I've got this card.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.040
If I use this card, I'm

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.800
going to take that resource anyway.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.480
So whether you do the trade

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.960
or I'm going to take it anyway.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.320
So I did the trade with him

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.400
and it later transpired

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.080
he didn't even have the card that he said he had.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.360
And I was kind of shocked,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.560
basically because it was a lie

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.440
and I was sort of like, wow, I can't believe you lied.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.640
And he said, look, it's a game.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.200
You know, I'm trying to win the game.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.120
You know, that's... 

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.360
that’s the way that it is.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.160
And I'm reminded also of a friend of mine

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.080
when we were teenagers,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.920
I used to play a lot of Monopoly,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.000
and I played with my high school friends.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.600
And I think the first three games

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.040
I won, I was quite good at monopoly,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.440
which is quite a big deal because it’s

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.960
a 5/6 player game.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.320
And then one of my friends decided that the way to win

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.840
Monopoly is to specifically stop Gary from winning.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.040
And he would attack all of...

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.640
every time I tried to trade with someone,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.120
he would just attack that other person,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.640
like brutally insult the other person.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.120
And I would ask him afterwards, like, why, why,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.280
why are you telling everyone these deals are bad?

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.320
You know they're not bad deals.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.480
But he would genuinely believe in his heart

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.040
that they were bad deals.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.040
And I would start doing a thing where

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.760
if he attacked a deal,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.800
I would start saying to the person

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.200
I was trying to trade with, okay,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.240
if you think that's a bad deal,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.000
let's completely flip the deal.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.560
I will take everything you were going to have,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.280
and you can have everything I was going to have.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.880
And this friend of mine would immediately

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.840
switch on an instant

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.120
into attacking the other side of the deal,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.400
and he didn't think it was at all consistent

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.640
to attack both sides of the deal.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.920
Whichever side of the deal I was on.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.800
I think what this shows is

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.600
when people really, really want something,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.240
they will

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.360
basically believe

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.400
whatever they need to believe in that moment

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.640
and say whatever they need to say in that moment

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.880
to get that thing.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.560
So don't expect consistency.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.000
Don't expect consistent ideology.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.720
Don't expect consistent beliefs.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.040
What you should expect

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.600
consistently is a consistent drive

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.120
to accumulate wealth and power.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.680
And what I want you to do when that happens

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.840
is to not get sucked in to the games

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.800
that are being played.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.200
Lots of words are going to be thrown around.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200
Lots of stories are going to be thrown around,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.880
lots of ideas are going to be thrown around,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.760
which are generally going to

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.160
be designed to destabilise you

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.440
and make you weak

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.560
so that your wealth

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.320
and your resources can be transferred

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.160
to the powerful over time.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
Don't get sucked into the game.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.680
I think if you can be dragged

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.520
into a game playing mentality,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.640
we can end up in a situation where it's a straight

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.120
shoot out in a game between the powerful and the weak,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.240
and unless you're a multi-millionaire,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.840
you are one of the weak.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.880
The way you win this game is to not play the game.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.240
Step outside the rules of the game, and realise

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.720
you need to ally with other poor

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.720
and ordinary people because if you don't,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.280
the rich will win the game,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.600
they will take your resources.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.880
And ultimately,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.960
in a crazy way,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.200
I think that's how I won my battle with Citibank.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.320
I went a little bit crazy.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.200
I broke a few of the rules, I stepped outside the game,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.360
and I never got sued, and I never went to prison.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.840
I never got bankrupted.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.280
And that is why I was able to write this book.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.160
It's out today.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.400
I'm very proud of it. It's called the Trading Game.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.400
I wanted to talk about truth, lies and games

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.880
because for me, a big part of the story is about

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.920
how I got sucked into a game,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.600
how young people get sucked into a game,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.080
and how when you get sucked into a game,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.440
an obsession with the game

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.600
can basically kind of kill your humanity inside.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.920
And it's that journey for me.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.880
I don't want it to happen to you.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.000
I don't want to happen to us.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.040
Listen,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.760
the next few years are going to be a difficult time.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.000
And they're going to be difficult

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.400
for your mental health,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.280
and they're going to be difficult for society.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.040
And they're going to be difficult

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.000
economically as well.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.800
I think the most important thing

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.800
is that you try to stay mentally healthy.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.440
And that means talking to each other,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.840
trying your best to be compassionate

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.760
and understanding of each other. Very rich and very...

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.520
very rich

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.400
and very powerful people

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.480
are going to be trying to drive us apart

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.840
and to make us unstable and to make us angry

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.080
and to make us hate each other.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.200
There's a great section in a great book about this.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.800
I think it's the two minutes hate

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.680
or the three minutes hate in 1984 by George Orwell,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.480
but he's basically talking about how

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.480
if the powerful can convince the poor to hate,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.040
not even anything specific, but just hate in general,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.640
then it's very easy to control them.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.320
Because people who hate are not people who can unite.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
And who of you can't unite,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.440
are not able to be powerful.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.480
Stay strong, speak to each other.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.920
I'll finish by just saying

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.360
thank you to everyone who supported us

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.680
so much since the comeback.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.280
The views have been just crazy.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.280
And the amount of attention has been crazy.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.400
But I'm really appreciative.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.400
And I will try my best

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.040
to build something that can help us,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.560
but you need to build things to,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.240
be there for each other.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240
Thank you for support.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.800
Thank you

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.760
especially for everyone who signed up for the Patreon.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.840
We really appreciate that.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.840
If you can buy the book, it's a very good book,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.880
but if you can't,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.800
then just support us

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.080
and then help us to drive forward

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.600
and help us try to make things better.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.400
Thank you. Good luck.
