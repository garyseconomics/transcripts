00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.680
I think it's important to understand that
because of the enormous increase

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.680
in house prices, primarily in this country
and in a lot of countries,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.800
people's financial positions now

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.520
are very largely a function
of the decision of how much debt

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.040
their parents
or their grandparents chose to take.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.560
Okay.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.280
So I wanted to start with explaining
the relationship between debt

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.760
and money, because we did a video
a couple of months ago

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
called What Is Money,
which a lot of people watched.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.080
And in that video,
I basically explained that

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.680
our modern monetary systems,
the money system of the UK,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.200
the US or Europe of basically
the whole rich world at the moment

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.000
is a debt based money system,
which means that money is debt.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.720
And what I said
at the beginning of that video was that

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.720
if we added up the total amount of money
in the whole of society,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.320
it would add up to zero.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
And that is because we have a debt
based money system,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280
which means that for every one person
with £1 of money,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.320
there has to be somebody somewhere
with £1 of debt and it cancels out.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.240
I think that can be a little bit confusing
for some people.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.560
When we think about it
from the money perspective,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.640
but now we can look at it
from the debt perspective.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.040
And I think that makes it a bit clearer
because it should be easy to understand

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.880
that the total amount of debt in society
is equal to zero.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.760
And the way that you should be able
to understand that is because we know

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.760
that it is impossible to be in debt

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.360
without being in debt to somebody.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760
So if we add up the total amount of debt,
it will equal the total

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.720
amount of money owed to somebody.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120
The amount of money
that everybody owes is equal

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.960
to the amount of money
that everybody is owed.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.560
And that is because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.480
every debt has somebody who is in debt
and somebody who is in credit.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.800
And we're going to use that term ‘credit’
to refer to having money owed to you.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.960
So if I borrow £100 from Simran,
then I have £100 of debt.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.560
I'm in debt.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960
And Simran has £100 of credit.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.680
He is in credit because I owe him money.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.320
So this is the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.480
first thing that debt adds up to zero.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.080
And it's obvious when you think about it
because you know that if you owe money,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.440
then you owe that money to somebody.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.720
Is it possible to owe money to nobody?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.520
But I think as much as it's obvious
when you think about it very often in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.880
our conversation about debt, it becomes
clear that we don't really think about it.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.320
Because, for example,
we know in the last three years

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.800
that the UK government debt
has increased by £700 billion.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.200
This very clear, we can check that.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.560
We know that the US government
debt has increased by £8 trillion,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280
sorry, $8 trillion,
and yet we very frequently act

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.280
as if that money has disappeared
and not gone anywhere.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360
And that is impossible.
That's not how money works.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.760
That's not how debt works.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.200
If the UK Government has gone £700
billion into debt,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.360
we know that somebody
must have accumulated

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.000
£700 billion of money
because that is how debt works

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.600
and that is how money works is always
a perfectly balanced system.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.080
If somebody is in debt,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.040
somebody has money, If somebody has money,
somebody is in debt.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.280
We have a debt based monetary system
debt is money.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.680
Money is debt the total amount of debt
adds up to zero.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.560
And I think this is super interesting

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.680
because in a sense,
as soon as you understand this,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.800
you understand our current economic crisis
much better,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.560
which is that, yes, it is true,
our government has gone £700 billion

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
into debt, into more debt
than it was already in.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.080
The US government has gone
$8 trillion more into debt.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.720
But those debts are to somebody
and the money that the government

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.520
has spent to go into that
debt has gone to somebody.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.600
If we were to find those people
who have that money, we will see that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.920
they have gotten enormously richer,
if we were to tax it back

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.040
the government debt would decrease.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.280
I think it's often when we think of debt,
we think of it as sort of wasted resources

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.960
resources that have disappeared

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.520
We say the government has spent 
that £700 billion, it's gone.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.400
That's not how debt works.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.920
If the government goes into debt,
somebody goes into credit

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.440
and we can match these things exactly.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.080
We know with certainty
that it will match up.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.680
And I think
when you think about this, it's actually

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
quite amazing because the total
amount of debt in society

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.760
is so enormous
that it's almost difficult to believe

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.480
that that money is owed to someone
and somebody has that credit.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.720
And the other side of that,
because the government

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680
debt alone in the UK is £50,000
for every UK adult.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.680
It's enormous.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.080
Five zero, £50,000, which means that
the average amount of money

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.520
held in the form of government
bonds must be £50,000 per adult.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.080
And it sort of blows the mind who has
that, that that's just government debt.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.960
All of the mortgages,
your mortgage, your friends mortgages,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.040
your parents mortgages, 
your children's mortgages.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.200
Every single mortgage is owed to somebody.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.720
And I think that there's sometimes
a slightly misleading understanding

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.560
that these this debt is just appears
and is owed to nobody.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.600
But in reality,
all mortgages are owed to somebody.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.880
And even though your mortgage is
owed to the bank,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.320
banks are in most cases
just intermediaries.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.680
Ultimately, they are lending you money
that comes from the depositors

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.120
or from their investors.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.040
So all of this money,
all of your mortgage money,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.480
all of the government debt,
all of the student debt, which is massive,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.320
especially in America,
is all owed to somebody, credit card debt.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.880
And I think when you consider
just how much debt there is,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.080
it becomes almost hard to accept.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.200
I remember the first time
this sort of thought occurred to me

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.880
that, you know,
all of this debt is owned by somebody

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.920
and the people who own that debt,
they often own it in the form of money.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.600
So let's let's talk about what

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.360
it looks like to the owners of the debt,
the people who are in credit.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.440
It looks like holding bonds
in an investment account.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.000
It looks like holding bonds
in your pension.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.960
It looks like holding money
in your bank account.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.520
So if you

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.920
if you have money in your bank account,
you probably think you just have money.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.360
But what actually happens
is the bank lends that money out.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.360
And essentially that money in your bank
account is somebody else's debt, is money

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.200
which has been lent to somebody
and you are a money lender.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.560
You are someone who is in credit
and you are on the other side.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.760
So I think it's

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.480
it's worth

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.240
realizing that all of this money
is owed to somebody and somebody has

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.480
all this money just simply
because the amount of debt is so enormous.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.960
And I think we often sort of
just internally assume

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.680
that debt just is to nobody
the debts, the aliens.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.960
We're in debt. Everybody's in debt.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.720
That's impossible.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.000
Society as a whole
has to have a total debt of zero.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.960
And the reason why it seems impossible
is because ordinary

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.920
people tend to be on a debt side,
the debtor side of the coin.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.160
So you have your share of the government
debt, you have a mortgage,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.320
but not many people have enormous piles
of cash in the bank or enormous investment

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.640
accounts of bonds, and that is because
of the inequality in society.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.760
So bonds and credit

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.640
tend to be overwhelmingly held
by rich people.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.760
Now we will get some people commenting,
and it is,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.200
of course, true that if you have a pension

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.360
or if you have a large bank account,
you are in credit.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.360
You are one of the people
who has the credit.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.360
But if you look
at the overall distribution

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.000
of credit of money
owed to people is overwhelmingly owned

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.800
largely by the richest people in society
of course, there will be some owned by,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.880
for example, pensions
and things like that.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.200
Another comment we get
is that we owe all of this money to China

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.360
or to foreigners.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.240
And it is, of course true that the UK
as a whole does have a debt to China.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.280
It also has a debt to Japan, but most of

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.360
the debt is own is owed internally

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.360
and there's a situation happening where

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.600
increasingly financial assets are owned
by a kind of international super elite

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.720
and they own

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.120
the debt of many, many countries,
which means that there are very wealthy

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.680
people to whom money is owed by British
people on the British government.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.520
But there are also very well
wealthy British people

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.760
who will have the credit
of foreign governments and foreign people.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.720
So don't allow yourself
to be sort of lured into this trick.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.440
Of all the money is all owed overseas

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.040
because overseas people also owed money
to British, wealthy people.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.880
The reality is more a situation

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.320
of ordinary people
and ordinary governments are in debt to

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.240
a kind of international,
super rich elite of which many are British

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.000
and many are American,
because America and Britain

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.840
and Western Europe are rich countries
and they are creditors.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.360
The money is largely
owed to wealthy people.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.040
In the rich world.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.560
And of course,
what is important to understand

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.280
is that every year, every month,
every day, the people who are in debt,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.440
which is you, if you are a taxpayer,
which is your government,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.800
which is you, if you have a mortgage,
pay money to the people who own credit.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.680
So every single day,
a big chunk of your taxes

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.440
goes to the wealthy debt holders

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.640
and a big part of your
your mortgage payments

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.800
go to those people as well.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.000
Now, the next thing I want to explain

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.080
is a little bit tricky, but I think it's
important to understand the function

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.400
that debt plays in our economy,
which is that debt is a form of ownership.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.520
It and I think the best way to understand
this is to consider

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.880
the way in which corporations
finance themselves.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.760
So we tend to know about shareholders,
which is if corporations need money,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.760
they sell shares,
they get money from the shareholders,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.200
and the shareholders give the money
to the company that it needs.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.240
But in actuality, corporations

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.000
choose largely
between two ways of raising funds,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.720
which is selling shares to shareholders
and selling bonds, which is essentially

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.320
borrowing money from wealthy people
who want to lend money.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.600
And in many cases
they take more than 50% of their funding

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.080
from people
who lend the money to them, to creditors.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.200
So when you are running a corporation,
you have a choice between

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.720
how do you raise funds from stockholders
or from bondholders?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.280
Who are the people who lend the money?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.560
And when you think about it
like this, you realise that

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.080
stockholders and bondholders 
are really not that different.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.920
They are both people
that give money to a corporation

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.920
and then take a share of the profits
of the corporation.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.520
The way in which the profits are shared
is different.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.600
So the company first has to pay interest
to the bondholders.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.240
Then if there's any money left,
it pays the rest of the profits

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800
to the shareholders.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.040
But in a sense, it's not that different.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.600
If you are a bond holder or stockholder,
you give money to the company

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.720
and they give you a share of their profits
going forward.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.960
So we consider often in our mind

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.760
the stockholders
to be the owners of the company,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.120
but in a very real way, stockholders
and bondholders are not that different.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.040
And it's the same if you own a house.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.720
So obviously, if you buy a house,
you think you own the house.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.960
But if you buy a house
using a huge amount of debt,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.080
then really your situation is in many ways
similar to when you were still renting.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.840
Right. You know, of course,
there are differences.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840
You can choose what to put on the walls
and things like this.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.200
But if you're renting a house,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.120
you live in the house
and you have to pay a chunk of money

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.800
every month to the owner of the house
to live in the house.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.160
If you're owning with a mortgage,
you live in the house and you have to pay

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.560
a chunk of money to the moneylender
every month to live in the house.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.360
So I think it's important
to understand that really

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.880
debt is

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.960
a form of owning assets.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.840
It's it's not that dissimilar
to simply owning the asset and renting it.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.680
And in both cases, you'll see
if you stop making the payments.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.520
So if a corporation stops
making the payments to the debt holders,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.400
what will happen is legally
the debt holders will be given

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.400
possession of the company
because there is a form of ownership.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.120
And if you stop paying your mortgage,
what will happen is your mortgage

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.520
lender will take
legal possession of your house

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.000
because debt is a form of ownership
and I think it's

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.760
it's important to understand that

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.640
that basic fact really
that that debt is a form of ownership.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.960
And if you own an asset
with a large amount of debt,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.400
essentially
what is happening is a wealthy person

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.520
who has the money to lend you
is buying the asset through you.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.160
And of course,
debt is not the same as ownership, right?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.640
If you own the property with debt, you
you take the price risk on the property.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.760
If the price goes up, you make that money.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.960
If the price goes down,
you lose that money.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.480
Also, you have the the legal risk.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.720
So we have a situation in this country
where a lot of people bought property

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.600
and then found that they had to upgrade
the cladding on their property

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.160
and the owner had to take the
loss on that.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.720
So if you own

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.280
with debt, then you take

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.600
price risk, you take legal risk
and you also have to manage the property.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.640
But in a very real sense, you
if you have to pay to use that thing,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.080
be that through owning it or through
having debt, you do not own that property.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.520
So debt is a form of ownership
and it is a way of rich people

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.320
buying assets
and not having to worry about the price

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.000
going down,
not having to worry about management,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.160
not having to worry about about legal
risk.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.880
Really,
if you think about it from the perspective

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.120
of the wealthy lender, it's
kind of he's kind of running a business.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.640
He's saying, look,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.960
I have two ways of getting property.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.800
Either I buy it and I read it to you,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800
but then I take the risk
of the price falling.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.560
I take the risk of damage, I take legal
risk, or I'll lend you the money.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.800
And I probably won't make

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.360
so much money on it because interest tends
to be cheaper than rent,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.640
but you have to take the risk of price
falling.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.880
You have to take the risk of any damage
or legal problems and you have to manage

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.320
the property. So really

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:49.880
and I said this

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.000
many times, but I think it's interesting
to understand that is a form of ownership

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.920
is a way of wealthy people owning assets

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.480
and having you manage them.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.120
So in a way,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.840
this way of owning assets through
debt is quite good for the rich, right?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.800
Because I don't have to worry about
if the price goes down.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.160
I don't have to worry about managing it
every day.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.760
I don't have to worry
about any legal risks.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.880
You manage it for me and you still pay me
the interest every month.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.720
I don't have to do anything.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.120
It's pretty fantastic
way of owning assets.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.680
And yet

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.680
people overwhelmingly prefer

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.600
to own their property, even through
a massive amount of debt than renting.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.200
Why is that

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.640
So there are a couple obvious reasons
why people prefer to own with debt

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.880
rather than to rent, such as

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.040
You know, you can make your own changes,
you can, you know,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.080
paint the walls, these kind of things.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.840
But let's try and focus
on only financial reasons.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.480
Why is it that people
prefer owning property

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.520
even with a huge amount of debt
to renting property?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.560
The primary reason, in my opinion,
why people prefer that

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.760
is because in the last 30 years,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.720
property prices have gone massively up.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.320
And as

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.320
I said when I spoke about debt
as a form of ownership,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.280
when you own with that,
you take the price risk.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.120
So if prices go down, you lose money.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.040
If prices go up, you make money.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.480
And in the last two years, prices
have gone up massively.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.680
So buying assets with debt has been

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.920
a really, really good financial investment
for people in the last 30-40 years.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.560
And for that reason, I think
we've kind of internalised this idea that

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.400
taking on debt to buy assets is good
because prices always go up.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.400
And I think

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.080
an interesting thing is happening here,
which is that

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.600
basically

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.720
people who

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.360
I think it's important to understand that
because of the enormous increase

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.360
in house prices, primarily in this country
and in a lot of countries,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.480
people's financial positions now

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.200
are very largely a function
of the decision of how much debt

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.720
their parents
or their grandparents chose to take.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.680
So if my parents

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.040
had chosen to take on four
mortgages or five mortgages,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.320
they would be much, much richer

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.600
now than if they did
what they actually did do,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.880
which is to only take one mortgage
on a small house.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.720
And we've created this quite interesting
set of financial outcomes

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.720
where we've really, really rewarded
people who took

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.560
quite risky economic actions,
which is to take on huge amounts of debt

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.840
and to buy huge amounts of assets
and take huge amounts of price risk.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.600
But they have made money
because prices have gone up.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.760
And I think those people often
think that they've made money

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.240
because they are very effective
property investors.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.480
But it's probably worth
realising that in the last 20,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.800
30 years it's not just property
that has gone up in price.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.400
Basically every asset has gone up in price
and in most cases

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.440
the stock market has outperformed
the property market.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.720
It depends what country
you look, but in most cases that is true.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.800
We've also seen
massive increases in land prices.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.520
Luxury art, luxury cars.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.840
So what really happened
in the last 30 years is

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.960
anybody who bought a

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.280
tonne of assets will have made money.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.040
It's not actually about property prices
rising.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.360
It's more about asset
prices rising in general.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.280
And this brings me to my final point,
which is the reason that people

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.600
who have taken a lot of debt
have made a lot of money in the last 34

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.480
years is not really
because asset prices have done well,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.120
but it's because money has been devalued.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.040
And since money is debt and debt is money
debt has been devalued as well.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.600
So anybody who took a huge amount of debt
and then saw the prices of everything go

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.520
up, essentially have made money

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.960
on the fact that they took
debt and debt has been devalued.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.760
So people who think they made money
in the property market,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.640
they would have made just as much money
if they borrowed

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.240
money and bought stocks
or borrowed money and bought land.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.360
So what they really made money
on, when you look at it,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.280
is they made money on their mortgages.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.360
So we have we've created a country
of people who thought they made money,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.120
probably speculating, but really
they made money betting on interest rates.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.920
Essentially, they made money
betting that money would be devalued.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.960
They made money

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.920
essentially shorting

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.880
the value of money
because they borrowed money and then they

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.160
they sold the money
and then the value of the debt went down.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.800
So I think it's quite interesting
in a way that

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.520
we've created this
financial incentive structure

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.960
that really rewards people
for taking debt,

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.280
even though they take on a huge
amount of debt

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.960
is not particularly sensible thing to do.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.280
So you know I'm I'm going

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.560
to put a video out after this one
about why money's being devalued.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.120
I think it's very true that money
continues to be devalued in our society.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.680
That means debt will be devalued.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.560
That means people who have taken large
amounts of debt will continue to do well.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.600
But it's important to understand
that it's a phenomenally risky

00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.320
way to make money, and increasingly
it's only accessible to rich people.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.440
You know, if you're

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.680
if you're a poor person,
you can't get a mortgage,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.960
you can't buy a house,
you can't do this thing of taking on debt

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.040
and buying assets,
which which has made a lot of people rich,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.880
Okay, so that's debt.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.800
Basically,
debt is the opposite of of money

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.920
as debt has accumulated,
money must have accumulate.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.600
And this is not really well understood
in the media.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.040
You know,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.200
a lot of sort of stupid things

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.440
have been said
like during the COVID crisis

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.760
when the government was going
massively in debt, the media was saying,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.080
you know,
we're going to have an economic boom

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.280
because people are accumulating money,
people are accumulating savings.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.000
Other people would say

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.800
once people spend their savings,
that the economy will go back to normal.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.640
But once you understand that 
debt is money, savings are debt,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.320
you would understand that

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.920
if the government goes massively into debt
like it did into COVID,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.000
somebody has to accumulate money
and it's impossible for society

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.160
to get rid of that money
unless the government pays down that debt.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.680
So I really want to understand
the symmetry here between debt and money.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.120
Money and debt. It's the same thing.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.640
And I think what that allows us to see
is the COVID experience

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.280
in a different light,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.480
which is when the government goes into
debt, somebody has to benefit.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.880
And if the government is now
in a situation,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.320
it can't pay for basic services,
That is because somebody has benefited.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:13.760
And that's why

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.840
I continually harp on in this channel
about who has the £700 billion.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.640
It would be enough

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.000
that £700 billion to give £14,000
to every single person in the country.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.880
So when the government goes £700 billion
into debt and you don't get £14,000,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.680
it's effectively
the same as the government

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.400
taking £14,000 from you
and giving it to the rich.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.960
Okay, so that's it.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.840
Debt is money.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.840
Money is debt 
the government has gone into debt.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.520
The rich have accumulated
huge amount of money

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.760
that has
led to a massive increase in inequality.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.560
The last final point

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.280
I would like to add is
that debt is not the only form of wealth.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.240
There exists real wealth, property,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.800
land, natural resources, factories,
productive machinery.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.560
And who owns
these things is important as well.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.200
So debt
is extremely unequally distributed.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.720
But I think sometimes
people focus on the debt system

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.960
and the monetary system
as the only source of our problems,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.640
but we also have phenomenally
unequal distribution of real resources.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.480
And yeah, that all needs to be fixed
if we want to deal with the cost of living

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.000
crisis because inequality has increased

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.520
and you are seeing that fall
in living standards for ordinary people.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.640
Okay, thank you.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:17.680
So it's start again.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.840
Once you understand that there is a
form of ownership, you also realize that

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.680
that kind of obscures true ownership. So,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.120
for example, the government
wants to keep people owning properties,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.720
but it's difficult for people
to afford properties

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.520
because people are getting poorer
and poorer.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.960
The only way that they will fix
that is they will put ordinary families

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.800
more and more into debt.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.200
So you see they'll have more 100%

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.360
mortgages, might even be 110%
mortgages, longer term mortgages,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.880
much bigger mortgages.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.040
So you still own the property,
but you have way more debt.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.520
And then people feel happy because they
own the property, but they're in debt.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.080
They're much more in debt. See?

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.880
So in a sense debt, debt is confusing
because people don't.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.720
It means that you can lose your home
without realising you've lost your home.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.560
Because you still are the 
technical owner of the home

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.560
But now you're ****ing
half a million pounds in debt, right?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.760
Or maybe £1,000,000 in debt.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.920
If house prices got more, you know, 
in 20-30 years, the average British family

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.960
will be £2 million in debt on the House,
but they'll still own the home.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.000
You know, I mean,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.600
*???*

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.800
You know, and really interesting is if you
look at the situation of the government.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.360
Right.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.840
So the government still owns the hospitals
and it still owns the schools.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.640
But if you look at the total
amount of government debt,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.080
it is now bigger than the total value
of all government assets.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.640
So in a sense, does the government
really own the hospitals &amp; the schools?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.000
It has to pay so much interest on the debt
that it's raised to own them.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.840
See what I'm saying.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.680
So you need to really,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.000
really what you need to consider is
your net wealth, total assets minus debt.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.200
And if you're keeping your assets,
but your debt is going up

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.720
and up and up, in a sense,
what's happening is

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.080
that is the rich kind of employing you
as middle management to manage your own

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.200
house, which they really own.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.080
So I'm saying and now increasingly

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.400
a big chunk of your taxes
is going to pay government interest.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.920
You know, if the government didn't
own the schools but it didn't have a debt,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.480
you'd have to pay rent for the government
to rent the schools.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.000
It's the same thing.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.600
It's the same thing.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.920
So so debt debt obscures true ownership
and sometimes confused confuses

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.160
people about the real situation,
about who owns things.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.760
And what you are going to see now going
forward is the government is more in debt.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.960
Ordinary people are more in debt
because house prices are higher.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.320
But you still own your
so don't worry, you own it,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.680
but just pay us all of your money
to be allowed to own it.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.920
You see, I'm saying so

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.680
in a sense, owning with debt is very,
very similar to renting.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.520
Very similar to renting.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.800
But of course, house prices always go up.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.480
So you're going to be fine.
