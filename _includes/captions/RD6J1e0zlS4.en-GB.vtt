00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.760
Today

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200
we are going to talk about falling

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
inflation and the terrible economics media.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.800
Okay.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.560
So we're going to do something

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.000
a little bit interesting this week

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.640
which is, we are filming this on Monday

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.920
the 13th of May.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.440
We're going to put it out this Sunday,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
which will be the 19th of May.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.360
And so if you're watching this on the Sunday,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.320
this coming Wednesday, which will be the 22nd of May,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.160
UK inflation data will come out

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200
and I can tell you now

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.360
with a very high degree of confidence

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.280
that it will be reported in all the media, UK

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.560
inflation is falling

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.600
and we're going to talk today

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
about how I can tell you that with so much confidence.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680
We're going to explain to you how I know in advance

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.560
that UK inflation will fall on Wednesday,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.640
and we're going to explain to you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160
how you can do that yourself.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.120
The reason is because

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.280
the economic number,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.440
which is constantly used in the media for inflation,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.320
is one year CPI.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.960
CPI stands for consumer price inflation

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.360
or consumer price index.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.600
And when we look into that one year we have 12 months.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.880
And the inflation in the last year

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.120
is basically the sum of the last 12 months.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.080
So I'm going to show you now

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.560
the last 12 individual months of inflation.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.200
So I'll bring them up here.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
So these are the last 12 months of inflation.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.080
You can see April ‘23 was 1.2%.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.360
May 2023 was 0.7%.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640
And then we've got a lot of numbers.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.280
Some of them are negative, some of them are positive,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.520
but they're a lot closer to zero.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.600
This is the last 12 months of inflation.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880
At every point,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.920
yearly inflation is the last 12 months of inflation.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.320
When a new number comes out.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.560
So the number which is coming out

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.920
this week is the April 2024 inflation.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.000
Then we will stop counting the April 2023 inflation.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480
So that very high bar the top will drop out.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.240
And we'll get a new bar coming in.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.320
So I think this is the first thing

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.280
which you need to understand to figure out how we can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.320
predict changes in yearly inflation,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.040
which is that yearly

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.520
inflation is always the sum of the last 12 months

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.400
of monthly inflation.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400
Now this Wednesday, we'll get the April figure.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.200
We don't know at this point

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.720
what the April 2024 figure will be.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.080
But we do know what the April 2023 number is,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.600
which will be dropping out of the calculation.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.480
That is this number here,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.080
which is 1.2%, which is really high,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.600
1.2% monthly inflation.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.160
If you want to turn it into a yearly inflation

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.400
you have to times it by 12,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.080
or actually you have to do a little bit more than that,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.200
but it works out at approximately

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.000
14-15% yearly inflation.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.040
So last April inflation was really, really high.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.480
When this April's number comes out on Wednesday,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.840
we will stop counting last April's number.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.760
So straight away,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640
unless the April number for this year

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280
is really, really high

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.960
because the number

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.840
which we're no longer counting was really, really high,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.160
we know straight away that the yearly number will fall.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.400
That is how I can tell you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.760
with a great degree of confidence now,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.040
when the number comes out on Wednesday,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.760
yearly inflation will officially fall

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.680
and all of the media will say

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.480
fantastic, inflation is falling

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.280
and all the conservative

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920
politicians will be super happy.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.200
Now, when you think about it,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.760
this is in a way kind of stupid.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.400
If we know already now

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.440
that inflation is going to fall on Wednesday,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.000
why should we be happy?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.800
Why should we celebrate when Wednesday happens?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.000
If Wednesday was important

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.600
new information, then we should be able to...

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.800
We shouldn’t have to wait until Wednesday to be happy,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.440
but we already know it's going to,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.120
it's going to be good.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.600
The reason is because, quite simply,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.760
the period of high inflation

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.040
is no longer in the most recent year

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.600
as of this Wednesday.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.920
So really, it's a technical thing, right?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.160
We only look at the last 12 months.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.360
And increasingly

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.080
if you have, as we had a one of big spike in inflation

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.720
as time passes,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.160
that massive inflation is increasingly no longer in

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.240
the most recent year.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.600
So as the inflation falls out of the last year,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.320
we see our inflation normalise.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.440
To celebrate that is essentially celebrating

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.840
the passage of time.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.080
We're simply celebrating

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.760
the fact that the mass inflation we had

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.000
is no longer the most recent 12 months.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.760
So a few things to clear up here. Right.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.760
As inflation is falling towards target.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.880
First thing to make really clear...

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.520
I’ve said it before

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.160
but it’s important that you realise,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.720
inflation falling down closer to 2%

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.520
does not mean that prices are coming back down.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.080
Inflation is the rate of increase of prices.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.800
So even though inflation will come down

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.080
closer to 2% next month,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.160
that doesn't mean that prices are normalising.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.240
It simply means that they're not

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.320
going up that quickly anymore.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.920
Your life will not get better.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.280
Your groceries will not get cheaper.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.400
It simply means they're no longer

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.960
going up at a rapid rate.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.160
Second question and we've covered this before.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.800
Should the conservative government, should Rishi

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.480
Sunak and Jeremy Hunt be given credit for this?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.120
Now,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.400
those of you who've been watching the channel

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.720
for a while will remember in January 2023,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.480
I put out a video about Rishi Sunak’s inflation pledge.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.560
The reason I did that was this.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.720
So if I show you the longer term

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.280
monthly inflation, so here

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.120
you see five years of monthly inflation.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.320
I put that video in January ‘23, which is about here.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.240
You could already see at this point

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.240
that we'd moved past the period of very high inflation,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.000
and over time,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.600
the very high months of inflation

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.080
would gradually fall out of the statistics.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.400
So at the beginning of Jan ’23,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
it was already very clear

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.480
to basically everyone in economics

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.320
that inflation was going to start falling,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.000
probably pretty quickly.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.560
At least the official yearly figure of inflation.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.200
And I considered at the time doing a video

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.120
predicting inflation would fall

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.040
because I thought, well, we can make a prediction.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.560
It would definitely be right.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.000
It's an easy prediction to make,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.280
you kind of get some credibility

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.640
for predicting a thing in advance.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.440
And I chose in the end not to make that video

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.680
because I felt that it was quite

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.960
cheap of me to try to claim credit

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.960
for predicting something,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.800
which basically at the time, everybody

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.560
in economics knew would happen.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.320
So I decided not to make the video

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.400
predicting inflation would fall.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.760
And then Rishi Sunak came out and said,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.000
I will pledge to reduce inflation

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.920
over the coming year,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.440
which I thought was quite hilarious because,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.560
you know, I decided not to make a prediction

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.200
inflation would fall

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.160
because it was so obvious that it would fall.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.440
And then Rishi Sunak came out

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.000
and not only did he predicted inflation would fall,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.040
he claimed credit in advance

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.840
for the fact that inflation would fall,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.800
despite the fact that it was very obvious at the time

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.200
that inflation was going to fall

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.920
quite simply because over time

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.560
the inflation would no longer be counted

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.280
in the previous year.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.840
It's a little bit

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.760
like if Rishi Sunak punched you in the face

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.040
and then saw you with a big black eye

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.640
and said,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.000
I will pledge to reduce the swelling in your eye

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.320
over the next

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.320
two weeks, because this is

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.080
what happens with the passage of time

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.360
and the passage of time, things that happened

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.440
recently stopped being in the last year,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.120
and swellings go down over time.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.440
This is simply claiming

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.560
credit for things that happen over time.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.960
But I don't want to dwell on this too much,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.120
because the point I want to make here is largely

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.840
that the reporting of economic events

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.240
is often misleading.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.440
You will be told on Wednesday

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.680
inflation has fallen,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.080
whereas in reality

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.880
that inflation fall happened one year ago.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.120
Very little new information

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.280
will be received on Wednesday, most likely.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.640
It could be we get an unusually high or low print.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.960
Probably the monthly print will be about 0.5 0.6.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.360
And the reason that inflation

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.200
will fall on

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.560
Wednesday is not because of anything

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400
that happened on Wednesday.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.160
It's because of something that happened last April.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.800
And I think the lesson that we can learn from

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.920
this is not to get lost

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.920
in the political football of economic reporting.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.160
On this Wednesday, you will be told

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.800
inflation is falling.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.880
The conservatives will take credit for it.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.520
Labour will say, well, if you take credit for the fall,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.640
then you should take blame for the rise.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.960
And actually, the reality is

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.240
both of these stories are in a way dishonest.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.760
The fact that inflation has fallen is not

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.800
thanks to conservative government,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.320
and in large part,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.800
the fact that inflation rose

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.520
was not the fault of the conservative government.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.640
I do think there was a little thing that happened

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.960
around the ridiculous Liz Truss

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.240
mini budget, which added to inflation.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.760
But I'm going to show you now

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.000
graphs of inflation

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in a number of other countries across the world.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.720
So we'll show you the last

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.000
five years, inflation in the USA.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.840
We'll show you the last

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.040
five years of inflation in Italy.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.440
We'll show you the last five years of inflation

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.680
in Germany.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.600
What you can see here

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.840
is that basically the same thing happened

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.480
in pretty much every country

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.160
in the world in the last five years, which is inflation

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.640
spiked one off massively

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.600
and then it started to come down over time.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.280
This happened in pretty much every country.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.400
And if something happens in every country,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.760
what that tells you is this is not

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.400
to do with the specific

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.960
policies of the specific governments

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.720
in those countries.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.000
This is an international problem

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.240
which is happening in a number of countries.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.880
and this is a big trend in economics media.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.040
Which is

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.640
economics media basically wants to sell you

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.440
on the kind of Coronation Street,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.200
EastEnders soap opera politics of economics,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.600
which is everything good that happens

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.200
is thanks to current government.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.920
Everything bad that happens

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.080
is because of the current government and they want to

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.680
attach specific problems to specific

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.880
faces, specific names. Whereas the truth is,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.400
a big thing has happened

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.840
in the last 5-10 years

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.280
in basically every rich country in the world,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.720
which is that inflation increased massively.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.120
It came down again,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.960
inequality increased massively,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.440
living standards decreased massively.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.080
And this happened in basically

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.320
every country in the world.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.120
When I think of this, I'm really reminded of

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.840
the house price crisis, which... So I live in London.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.880
A lot of people in London

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.040
think the house price crisis

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.760
is because of London planning policy.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.720
A lot of people blame it on Sadiq Khan.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.960
I worked in finance for a long time,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.920
which is very international,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.680
and when I worked in finance,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.040
I met people from all over the world.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.680
And what I found is that

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.760
everyone in New York thinks that the New York House

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.360
price crisis because of New York planning policy.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.440
Everyone in Sydney thinks it's

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.080
because of Sydney planning policy.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.560
Everyone in Toronto and Vancouver

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.400
think it's because of their planning policy.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.440
Everyone in Dublin thinks it's

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.680
because of their planning policy.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.440
Everyone in Shanghai and Tokyo and Hong

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.640
Kong, Rio de Janeiro and Paris and Barcelona.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.440
All of these people think that

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.880
the global housing price crisis

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.400
is because of their specific policy

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.920
and the inflation crisis in the UK,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.000
is similarly being blamed on UK specific policy,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.840
when really what is happening

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.960
is a much bigger thing, which is that living

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.760
standards are falling all across the world.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.520
Inequality is rising all across the world.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.440
The rich are getting richer

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.080
all across the world, and ordinary working

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.280
people are suffering all across the world.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.520
Okay, so I think

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.920
we can learn a couple of lessons here

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.160
from this

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.400
obsession with the media,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.720
with small details and individual faces

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.840
and personalities of individual politicians.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.920
While living standards collapse.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.520
Number one, the problem is not UK specific.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.280
So I am British.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.560
I know most of all of you as a British,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.600
but we get watched all over the world.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.160
We often get messages on the channel

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.560
which is saying, Gary, you're right,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.080
Britain is totally messed up.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.680
What can I do? Where can I leave to?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.160
And I think this is actually

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.720
a really

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.520
worrying approach to a global problem,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.720
because we also have viewers

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.040
from all over the world, viewers from even countries

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.960
which are generally considered

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.360
to have stronger economies.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.120
Places like Australia, places

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.760
like New Zealand, places like the USA.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.640
And these people invariably say

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.680
things are just as bad here.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.520
Things are getting worse here.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.600
Living standards are getting worse here.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600
What can I do? Where can I leave to?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.240
And what you have is a global problem

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.120
of the global super rich

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.160
dispossessing Western middle classes.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.800
And every single person in the world is saying

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.120
this is because of my specific country,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.440
I'm going to leave.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.600
And if everybody focuses on trying to run away

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.960
from the rich and nobody focuses

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.880
on fighting the rich,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.400
then basically we're all going to lose.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.160
So I'm very aware that we have,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.800
you know, a variety of UK specific problems.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.400
And those of you not in the UK,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.160
I'm sure you'll be aware you have country...

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.560
You have country specific problems

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.040
in your country as well.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.840
But there's a big global shift in power

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.520
and in wealth away from middle classes

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.600
towards the rich.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.640
And if you don't fight it

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.040
then you will lose everything.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.880
The second lesson that we learn from this,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.960
I think, is to be wary of getting too much involved in

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.920
economics as political football.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.520
So we're here in the UK, we're going to get an election

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.240
this year.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.800
Almost certainly we'll get a change in government.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.440
We'll get a new political party coming in.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.080
A lot of people will be optimistic about that.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.520
But the truth is

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.160
this new political party is not realistically serious

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
about reducing wealth inequality.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.000
If they don't reduce wealth inequality,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.160
then they will not be able

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.240
to stop the fall in living standards.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.280
You know, we have many countries across the world

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.760
which have left or centre left governments.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.400
You know, we have Germany, we have Spain,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.600
we have arguably the USA.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.480
I know some people will say

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.560
that their government is not that centre left.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.800
What you see here is a variety of different government

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.400
centre left, centre right governments.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.080
In every case, living

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.720
standards have collapsed in the last five years

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.000
because they are not doing anything

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.800
about wealth inequality.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.400
Elections will be held in different countries.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.560
Governments will change.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.440
At the moment,

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.840
we do not have any serious, powerful political party

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.760
promising to do anything about wealth inequality,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.440
and that is because

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.760
ordinary people are being given

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.400
this kind of nonsense economics media,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.920
which is like things are getting better.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.960
Don't worry, stick around, don't rock the boat.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.800
Inflation is getting better and things will improve.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.800
Do not be fooled by economic media

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.320
that focus on throwing statistics at you

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.920
while your life gets worse and worse.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.840
There is a structural problem

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.040
of growing inequality, and neither centre right

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.640
nor centre left parties across

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.320
the world are serious about changing it.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.600
They are funded by very rich people

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.640
who don't want you to tax them more.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.360
Unfortunately, the only way to stop your life

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.400
from getting worse is to tax them more.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.880
Otherwise they will get richer and richer

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.840
and they will take your assets.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.320
So I think to conclude,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.600
we will see this week officially a fall in inflation.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.840
It will do nothing to make your life better.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.840
It's extremely predictable in advance,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.480
which tells you very clearly

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.800
that there is no new news coming in.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.400
It will be sold to you as new.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.200
It will be sold you is exciting.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.360
Don't buy it. Don't believe it.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.960
The structural problem is continuing to worsen.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.280
Wealth inequality gets worse and worse.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.440
Living standards continue to fall.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.320
Political parties who are funded by,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
and in many cases run by wealthy people,

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.360
are refusing to do anything about it.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.520
The only way to make things

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.360
better is to tax the rich more,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.920
tax ordinary working people less.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.000
That way we can get wealth flowing

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.320
in the other direction.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.440
We can make housing affordable,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.200
we can make your life better. But

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.520
the politicians won't listen to me

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.600
unless you guys support me.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.320
So keep promoting our stuff.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.560
Send this video to your friends,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.520
to your family, to your mum.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.680
Let's tax the rich.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.720
Let's get wealth back in the hands of working people.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.160
Thank you.
