00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
and they bring interest rates up when
 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.909 align:start position:0%
and they bring interest rates up when
they<00:06:56.720><c> think</c><00:06:56.880><c> the</c><00:06:56.960><c> economy</c><00:06:57.280><c> is</c><00:06:57.440><c> hot</c><00:06:57.680><c> they</c><00:06:57.840><c> want</c>

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
people to save
 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
people to save
so<00:06:59.759><c> in</c><00:06:59.919><c> 2008</c><00:07:00.400><c> interest</c><00:07:00.560><c> rates</c><00:07:00.840><c> collapsed</c>
