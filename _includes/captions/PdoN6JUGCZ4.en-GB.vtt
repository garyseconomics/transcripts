00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.200
All right Boris is out. Tory leadership&nbsp;
contest... what do you need to know? &nbsp;

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.320
the first thing you need to know and i think the&nbsp;
most important thing if you take away one thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.120
from this video is - it doesn't matter. it's not&nbsp;
going to affect you, it's not going to improve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.440
your economic circumstances, it's not going to&nbsp;
fix the cost of living crisis, it's not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.280
make it easier to pay your bills, it's not going&nbsp;
to make it easier to feed your family or to heat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:37.160
your home this winter and i can explain why&nbsp;
in two simple numbers first number £450 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.480
this is the total amount of money which has gone&nbsp;
from the government to the rich and the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.360
in the last two and a half years. Second number -
£15&nbsp;billion this is the total amount of money which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.800
the government is offering to support ordinary&nbsp;
families through the cost of living crisis once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.400
account for the fact that they've raised your&nbsp;
taxes so let's compare these two numbers right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.320
£450 billion that's £10,000 for every single&nbsp;
adult in the country all went to the rich so each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.040
one of them is getting 100-200 thousand pounds
£15 billion well that's 30 times less so it's about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.920
£300 for every adult in the country the key&nbsp;
thing to realize is the government caused a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.320
£450 billion problem of inequality that money went&nbsp;
to the rich and now they're trying to fix it with&nbsp;just&nbsp;

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.600
£15 billion pounds - 30 times less. the amount&nbsp;
of money gone from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.520
is 30 times more than the amount of money they're&nbsp;
giving you to fix it what does that mean well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.160
if you try putting a £15 billion pound sticking&nbsp;
plaster on a £450 billion pound wound basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.320
you're not going to fix the problem and none&nbsp;
of the tory leadership candidates and i suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.360
probably no one in the tory party is serious&nbsp;
about fixing that problem if you want to fix that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.880
problem you need to start taking serious amounts&nbsp;
of money from the rich and giving it to ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.800
people remember £450 billion would be £10,000
pounds for every single adult in the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.160
imagine if the government gave you £10,000&nbsp;cash
now how much that would help you well they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.280
done that for the rich and they're not going&nbsp;
to fix it okay so number one it doesn't matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.760
it's not going to fix your problems so stop paying&nbsp;
attention to it it's a circus these guys are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.200
dancing around telling you they're going to help&nbsp;
you at the same time they're making themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.160
richer and you poorer what should you be focusing on&nbsp;
you should be focusing on your money, your wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.880
your family's money, your family's wealth, your&nbsp;
community's money, your community's wealth these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.080
are the things you should be focusing on and this&nbsp;
is what you should be looking at okay if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.080
old enough to have kids you should be looking&nbsp;
realistically at your financial situation and your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.400
kids financial situation and you should be asking&nbsp;
yourself are my kids going to be able to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.600
in a better house than i live in now? are they&nbsp;
going to be able to afford to own more and better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.400
quality property than i own? are they going to&nbsp;have
a much much bigger mortgage than i ever had&nbsp;or

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.400
are they going to be able to afford to live a&nbsp;good
life without taking massive amounts of debt?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.760
and if you're younger you should be comparing&nbsp;
yourself to your parents am i going to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.680
to live in a better property than them? am i going&nbsp;
to be able to become richer than them in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.160
actual ownership of wealth? am i going to be able&nbsp;
to live a life without taking a massive mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.840
and i think if most of you look realistically you&nbsp;
are going to see that generation after generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.000
ordinary people are losing their homes and being&nbsp;
forced into more and more debt and you need to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.360
yourself then okay well if we're losing our homes&nbsp;
where are the homes going who owns the homes now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.240
those homes are not disappearing and if we're&nbsp;
getting into more and more and more debt well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.720
who are we going into debt to you can't be in debt&nbsp;
to no one right if you are in debt then you are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.520
debt to somebody right so if we're losing ordinary&nbsp;
families in this country are losing their homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.920
and going into debt somebody has to be getting&nbsp;
richer and richer and richer because somebody has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.520
to be owning that debt and owning those properties&nbsp;
and who is it well look in the last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.920
what has happened right the average billionaire&nbsp;
has increased their wealth by 30 40 50 percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.840
unbelievably rapid increases in billionaire&nbsp;&amp;
millionaire wealth, people like Rishi Sunak who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.280
is one of the richest men in the countries&nbsp;
worth over £700 million pounds according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.160
the times rich list have massively massively&nbsp;
increased their wealth, while ordinary families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.080
increasingly can't afford to turn their heating&nbsp;
on so here we have a situation where a political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.600
party full of extremely wealthy people who&nbsp;
have presided over a system where they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.520
gotten massively richer during a crisis where half&nbsp;
the country can no longer afford to feed and heat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.680
their families, are telling you don't worry guys&nbsp;
we've got this we're changing the face on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.720
label we're going to sort everything out, don't&nbsp;
believe it these guys are taking your assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.120
these guys are taking your homes these guys&nbsp;
are putting you into debt so turn it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.480
turn it off i don't care if his name is Rishi&nbsp;
or Penny or Kemi honestly i don't care none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.240
these guys are going to help you none of these&nbsp;
guys are going to help you but what it does show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.800
is that these guys are organized okay they know&nbsp;
you don't trust Boris anymore so we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.920
put a new face on it we're going to put a new face&nbsp;
on it and we're going to tell you everything's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.280
going to be fine they're organized they've got&nbsp;
a media strategy billionaires own the newspapers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.800
and they're going to tell you look everything's&nbsp;
fine everything's going to get better and why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.840
they tell you that because these guys are getting&nbsp;
richer and richer and richer by taking your assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.080
so of course they don't want you to push back&nbsp;
they're organized they've got a media strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.680
they understand we need to change the&nbsp;
name on the label every now and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.600
to convince people that even though things are&nbsp;
getting worse now things are going to get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.080
well it's a lie you need to understand these guys&nbsp;
are super rich they have an organized strategy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.240
take your wealth so keep an eye on your wealth&nbsp;
your family's wealth and your community's wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.520
make sure that instead of that wealth going to&nbsp;
them we're starting to get wealth back from them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.960
and how do we do it well these guys&nbsp;
are organized they've got a strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.800
they're trying to convince you that everything's&nbsp;
okay everything's going to get better you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.120
be organized as well look these guys have the&nbsp;
money they own the media we are never going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.640
be as funded as them we're never going to own the&nbsp;
media like they do the only power we really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.320
is that there's more of us there's much more of&nbsp;
us but we only use that power if we act together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.120
they want us to fight amongst each other and&nbsp;
argue over the little bit that is left for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.680
but if we come together and push back we can start&nbsp;
taking wealth and assets and money back from these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.440
people but we can only do if we come together&nbsp;
so message to take away from this turn the tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.920
off ignore these people they're just selling you&nbsp;
lies but they're taking your houses the way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.520
take these houses back is to convince and educate&nbsp;
your friends your family and your community about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.200
what's happening, we're losing our wealth they're&nbsp;
taking it, the only way to take it back is to unite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.760
