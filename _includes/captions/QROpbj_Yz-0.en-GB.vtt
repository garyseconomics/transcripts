00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.320
Today

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.880
we are going to cover everything

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.400
you've missed on the economy.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.920
So to do this video,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.720
I went back and had a look at my video from last year,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.200
bringing you up to speed with the economy.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.840
And

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.720
that video last year,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.480
I was saying that inflation

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.280
would come back to pretty much target.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.000
Interest rates would start to fall.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.560
We would see an enormous increase in stock prices,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.360
an enormous increase in the gold price,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.160
and we would see house prices start to go

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.320
as interest rates started to fall.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.520
But despite all of that,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.040
we would continue to see living standards and poverty

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.520
continue to decline.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.080
And this is basically everything we've

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.200
seen in the last year.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.240
I also said that Labour would win the election,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.760
probably by a decent margin, because the Conservatives

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.400
were failing on the economy and were super unpopular,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.920
but that Labour would very quickly become unpopular

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.400
on coming into power.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760
So if you've been keeping up to speed of what

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
we've been doing,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.400
you won't be p***ed off that I was away for six months

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440
because you already knew

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.960
exactly what was going to happen.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.160
So what are we going to cover now?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.760
Okay, so this year we're going to cover

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
a few of the things which happened while I was away,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.360
which I've not been able to talk about yet.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.000
And their economic impact.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640
In particular, Labour’s

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.960
budget in the autumn and the Trump election.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.760
We're going to talk about how this year

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.640
and the coming year will be different from last year.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.440
We're going to talk about,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.280
a little bit

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.320
about what's going to happen in the economy

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
and what's going to happen in financial markets.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.840
So I want to start with how this year is different

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.120
from last year,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.920
because when I went and watched last year video,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.320
I was quite struck by basically how much was the same.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000
So I had to look at financial markets

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.200
before I shot this video and basically

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.800
everything is at an all time high.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.640
Most major stock markets are at or near

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120
their all time highs in terms of price.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.160
The gold price is at or near its all time high.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.280
House prices are shooting up to new all time highs.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.480
We're starting to see them start to really go.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.560
And, it's kind of deja vu all over again.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.720
So it's quite shocking, I think.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.440
I think that really underlines

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.920
basically how aggressive these increases in asset

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.040
prices have been.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.960
And I think it's important to talk about that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.800
because I think what we see on the news

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.560
and what most of us understand about the economy,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.360
is that living standards

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720
have really failed to recover,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.200
and they continue to slide,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800
and that gives the impression of a very weak economy.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.400
And I do think we have a very weak economy.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.080
But what is often not spoken about

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.600
is this fact that if you're looking at the economy

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.120
from the perspective of the asset holders,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120
which is basically from the perspective of the rich,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.160
things are really, really, really, really good.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920
Everything is at massive all time highs.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360
So you're going to see the rich people

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.440
seeing continued increase in their wealth.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.840
They're basically doing the best they've ever done.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.520
And I think this basically kind of underlines

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.840
the point

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360
which I've been making for a long time,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.960
which is this is not an economic crisis for everyone.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.000
This is an economic crisis for you.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.680
While the rich do really...

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.240
While the rich do really well,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.920
which I think kind of underlines

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.200
that this is a crisis of inequality.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.600
But I think what is probably most interesting

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.000
that is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
different about the economy now compared to last year,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120
is I did my video last year,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.120
inflation was still just above 4% in this country,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.080
and there was still this kind of perception

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.240
that we were living in a very weak economy

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.440
because we were still in the kind of economic

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.840
aftermath of Covid,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.960
and there was still this kind of perception

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.840
that, well,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.040
we're screwed at the moment

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.560
because Covid was really bad

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.840
because of the Russia-Ukraine war,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.720
but we're going to come through

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.120
that and things to be better.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.240
And yet here we are

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.560
a year later and we’ve started to see

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.920
pretty much everything normalise.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.520
Inflation is pretty much back down to around target

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.200
in most countries.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.440
Commodity prices,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.720
which went up in the war in Ukraine,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.840
most of those are back down to the same levels

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.560
they were before the war in Ukraine.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.320
Interest rates are starting to come back down again.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.400
Unemployment is at normal levels.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.000
GDP is back higher than it was before Covid.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.480
And yet,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.720
despite the fact that everything

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.280
has kind of normalised,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760
living standards for ordinary people

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.120
are still significantly worse.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.640
There's two things about this.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.520
The first one is that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.800
I think this firstly underlines

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.880
that the thing I've been saying for a long time,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.920
which is what we are seeing economically,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.680
the reason for the fall in living conditions

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.160
is not

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.280
about

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.400
supply chain problems during Covid,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.920
or about the aftermath of the Ukraine war.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.680
What we are seeing

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.360
is a permanent decrease in living standards

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.800
because we had a permanent increase in inequality.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.080
I think the first thing is

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160
it's becoming harder

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
to spin what you are seeing as temporary,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.120
because it's becoming more increasingly permanent.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.200
The second thing about that

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.640
is it creates

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.080
this kind of interesting situation in politics,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.120
which is

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.800
basically every country that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.760
had an election,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760
the political party

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.960
that was in power significantly lost their election.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.000
They got basically smashed.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.200
And this is because people are seeing, well,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
the economy is permanently

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.040
broken and people want change.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680
And yet no political party

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.960
has really sort of got a pitch.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.520
So as the center has failed

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.000
and there's been a loss of faith,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.120
a loss of faith in this idea

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.080
that what's happening is temporary.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.360
An increasing demand in you need to fix it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.080
You need to change what's happening.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.160
The center has collapsed

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.360
and you're seeing basically

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.880
a complete political reformation.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.920
What you have is

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.840
political parties

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.040
need to change their messaging on the economy.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.560
They need to say,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.240
we're going to do something dramatically different,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.040
and you're starting to see

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.080
those new kind of messages take shape.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.640
So I think when you talk about the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.080
US election,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.280
you can kind of see, and also the UK election really,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.280
you can kind of see what the new message is

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.680
from the right of politics,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.760
which is the problem is migration,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.240
the problem is foreigners.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.560
And if you want to fix the problem,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.120
we need to be tough on migration.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.280
We need to be tough on foreigners.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.800
You can see that in Trump's rhetoric.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.240
You can see that in Nigel Farage’s rhetoric over here.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.640
You can see that in basically

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.960
all of the politics of Europe.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.440
That is basically a new message being put together.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.760
And that is a smart message.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.280
And the...

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.240
That is a message

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.880
which has been very popular throughout history.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.400
You know, we saw this in the early 20th century

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.680
from the political right.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.480
The reason that is smart is because when these

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.000
anti-immigration, anti-foreigner

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.600
political parties get into power

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.280
and they increasingly will get into power,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.920
we’re seeing it across Europe,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.720
we're seeing in the States

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.000
as these guys get into power,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.240
they will fail to fix the economy.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.360
And the reason they will fail to fix

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.400
the economy is because they are not dealing

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.880
with the fundamental problem,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.600
which is growing wealth inequality.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.280
But you've kind of got your excuse already built in,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.920
which is we tried our best

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.920
to hit the foreigners, to hit the immigrants.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.560
The left didn't let us go far enough.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.280
You need to let us go further.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.720
And you know, this is the kind of slide

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.280
which we saw in the early 20th century,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280
which led eventually to people

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.280
like Hitler and Mussolini getting into power.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.920
And I want to be clear,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.880
I'm not saying that Trump is Hitler.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.080
I'm not saying that Farage is Hitler,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.400
these guys will win power,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.680
they will fail to fix the economy

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.800
and the obvious political move

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.440
then, will be to go further right.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.600
And whilst these guys themselves are not Hitler,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200
the only path

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.640
that they will be able to go as they fail,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.960
because they can't deal with inequality,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.600
because they're not dealing with the inequality,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.000
they will simply be forced further

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.120
and further right over time,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.720
and you will see more and more

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.160
increasingly far right politicians getting into power.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.720
Basically. And that's the new space on the right.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.520
So what's the new space on the left?

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.960
And I think that is where we start

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.880
talking about the Labour budget and the election.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.960
So Labour won the election,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.520
on an extremely small number of votes.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.560
They actually got,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.160
I think, 5% less votes than they got in 2019

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.240
where they got absolutely smashed.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.880
So the actual number of votes went down

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.280
and they won simply because of complete collapse

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.120
in popularity of the Conservative Party.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.080
So they didn't really need

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.480
to have much of an economic message

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.080
because they won simply sort of

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.560
by default of not being the Conservatives.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.240
And then what did they want to do

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.960
when they're in power?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.720
I think if you were to pull

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.440
an average man or a woman

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.080
to the side in the street and say,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.320
what do you think is Labour’s economic plan?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.720
What do you think is Keir Starmer's economic plan?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.960
I think most people would not know what it was.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.040
I don't think they have a clearly

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.360
communicated economic plan.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.000
And if you were to ask me what it was,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.960
it's kind of a just a, let's just be really sensible.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.240
It's kind of a new, sensible-ism,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.480
this kind of belief that if you just do the status quo

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.320
hard enough, if you're just

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.640
sensible enough, things will get better.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.240
It's pretty weak. It will fail.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.480
And I think it's interesting to look at

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.000
what happened in the budget,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.120
which it was a relatively modest budget.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.240
They raised taxes a very small amount.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.640
They raised spending a very small amount.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.240
They raised borrowing by a very small amount.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.800
And yet people weren't happy with it.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.840
And the financial markets

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.200
almost refused the budget really.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.680
You saw government borrowing costs go up a little bit.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.080
I think what it shows basically, is that Labour

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.720
and the left are basically clinging

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.280
to a failed economic orthodoxy.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.320
Increasingly, what is clear is

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.280
we live in an economy where more and more

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.720
and more is being owned by the rich.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.720
So you are left with basically a choice.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.160
Either you tax the rich more

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.480
or you just accept that you are poor now.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.160
And the government is sort of

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.640
trying to tow this middle ground.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.680
We're going to borrow a bit more.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.920
We're going to spend a bit more,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.000
it's not going to work.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.400
It's going to fail. And,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.120
we're not going to see economic improvement.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.720
Okay. So what does that mean?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.640
We are still living in an economy

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.200
which is dominated by the growth in inequality

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.040
that happened over Covid.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.480
We are seeing the consequences,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.040
which you would imagine you would see

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.240
if you significantly increased economic inequality,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.920
which is a significant increase

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.360
in living standards for the rich

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.480
and a significant decrease

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.360
in living standards for the rest.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.560
Once you increase inequality...

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.800
Well, first thing I would say is

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.200
we are not going to see the kind of rapid declines

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.840
we saw during Covid unless there is another

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.400
economic disaster, because

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.720
that rapid speed of

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.240
increase in inequality was a one off.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.160
But that leaves us now at a high level of inequality.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.240
And if inequality is higher,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.800
that means ordinary

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.240
people are paying more interest to the rich.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.880
The government is paying more interest to the rich.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.600
Ordinary people are paying more rents to the rich,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.640
and the rich are receiving

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.280
more interest and more rents.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.600
So high levels of inequality

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.320
lead to higher levels

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.840
of increasing inequality,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.000
because it leads to high levels of payments

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.400
from the poor and from governments to the rich.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.280
So that means we're on basically

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.960
a steeper

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.240
gradient of permanent decline now,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.680
and you're going to just see this continued

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.800
immiseration.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.040
Living standards will continue to fall.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.880
And at the same time,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.240
because the rich getting richer, asset

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.160
prices will continue to increase.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.240
I should probably be clearer

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.840
in my predictions about asset prices,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.200
because in the past I predicted very, very aggressive

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.440
rises in asset prices that have happened.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440
This time last year,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.440
I had the massive long position on gold,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.760
and I've really cut it back a lot

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.960
because of the unbelievable speed of the increase.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.680
Gold prices and stock price have gone up

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.920
unbelievably hugely in the last few years.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.160
I think that's justified

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.280
because of the massive increase

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.600
of the wealth of the richest.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.200
But I couldn't

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.160
tell you with confidence

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.320
they'll be higher in a year's time

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.160
just because when things go up that quickly,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.800
they do tend to come back down a little bit.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.720
The one thing which I think will really go

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.200
this year is house prices.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.160
Interest rates have started to fall.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.400
They will probably continue to fall a little bit more.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.520
We'll probably see another sort of 0.75%, 1% come off

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.240
Bank of England

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.080
and Federal Reserve US

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.120
base rates in the next year or so.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.960
Once those interest rates go,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.360
house prices will really start to go.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.200
House prices have been kind of left behind

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.880
in this really aggressive asset price rally,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.520
and that is because it's much harder

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.840
for rich people to directly buy a ton of housing.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.040
So when rich people make an enormous amount of money

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.240
like they did in Covid,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.760
it's super easy to go into financial markets,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.080
buy stocks, buy gold.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080
And that's why you’ve seen

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.960
this massive increase in stock prices and gold prices.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.080
It's much more complicated for a rich person

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.240
to go out and buy and manage, you know, 100 properties.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.720
The way that rich people buy properties.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.360
And I think I'll probably do a video on this

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.120
at some point, is kind of through the banking system

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.240
and through the mortgage system.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.600
They put the money in the bank,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.080
and the banks lend you the money to buy a mortgage.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.200
And because interest rates have been so high,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.040
it has made it difficult, basically for ordinary people

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.040
to pass those eligibility checks.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.600
And it's kind of blocking rich people

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.440
from buying housing.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.400
What they want to do is lend you money

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.280
so you can buy a house,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.320
and they kind of indirectly

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.280
own your house through your mortgage,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.560
but because of very high interest rates, they’re

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.840
not being able to do that.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.200
As soon as rates come down,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.440
you're really going to start seeing house prices go up.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.240
With regards to interest rates and inflation.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.160
These will both come down.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:50.840
For a long time

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.640
I've had kind of a slightly ambiguous view on this,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.720
which is

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.760
because the middle class

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.800
is being really smashed and ordinary people's

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.720
spending power is being really smashed.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.440
This should have the effect

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.360
of really bringing prices down

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.640
and bringing inflation down,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.320
which should bring interest rates down.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.760
But it also has this secondary effect

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.360
of just really massively increasing poverty,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.160
which then kind of forces

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.680
governments to spend a lot more money

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.280
because people have like desperate need.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.920
And the government kind of has an obligation

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.360
to help the people,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.040
which is why you've seen much higher levels

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.600
of spending and government

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.240
deficits, sustained high government deficits

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.560
and those high government deficits

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.760
will tend to end up with the rich

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.680
and will tend to push prices up again.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.320
So there's a kind of a balanced view

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.000
on whether inflation rates come down.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.480
I think they will.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.280
But how quickly

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.760
and how far kind of depends on how much money

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.560
governments spend.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.640
I think you're kind of getting

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.160
to a point here

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.840
where basically

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.280
nothing governments do works,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.160
and that is because there's this kind of absurd,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.200
really stubborn unwillingness of governments

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.080
on either left or right

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.240
to accept that inequality might be the problem.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.320
What you're seeing is kind of

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.720
you've got an economy that is dying of cancer

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.160
and a political system

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
that does not believe cancer exists.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.240
So they keep trying to do a lot of sensible

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.560
seeming fixes, like more investment.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.000
And, you know,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.040
let's just, you know, be more efficient

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.560
and let's try and search for growth.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.360
You can't grow your way out of a cancer.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.560
You know, there's a gaping hole

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.040
in the bottom of the ship that needs to be fixed.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.960
Neither right nor left has any real understanding.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.080
So I think the only hope we have

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.400
if we want to prevent more economic worsening

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.320
is to really force this idea

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.440
into the political mainstream,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.120
that inequality is the problem.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.440
Until then,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.320
we will see continued economic worsening

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.400
and that will be combined

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.640
with continuing rises in asset prices,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.440
which means the rich get richer and richer.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.120
It's another very pessimistic economic picture,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.560
but the only chance we have to prevent

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.560
this is to really drive

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.080
inequality as the cause of the economic worsening

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.920
into the public narrative,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.160
into the public consciousness,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.200
and into the minds of the politicians.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.640
Labour are going to fail on the economy,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.200
and they'll be very unpopular in 2 or 3 years.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.240
The only thing I can do, and I would hope

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.080
for any of your support,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.640
is try and make this channel big enough

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.920
that in 3 or 4 years time,

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.600
when the next elections coming around

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.160
and Labour are in desperate need of a rebrand,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.520
that we are the best alternative,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.080
that's a big ambition, but I

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.680
think it's our only chance.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.080
Inequality is worsening. It will keep getting worse.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.440
The economy will keep getting worse.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440
We can fix it.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.760
We can reduce inequality.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.600
It's about taxing you less and taxing the rich more.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.800
We will be campaigning for it all year long.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.280
As long as I can keep it up.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.960
And we're grateful for your support. Thank you.
