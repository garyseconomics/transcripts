00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.200
Today we are going to do part

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
three in our educational series,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.440
Understanding Wealth Inequality and The Economy.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.400
And we're going to explain why

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.280
economists don't talk about wealth inequality.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.840
Okay.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.360
So in the first two videos in this series

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.080
we explained firstly what is wealth.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.800
Secondly, what is wealth inequality

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.640
and why it is destroying our living standards

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640
and making people poorer?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920
Today's video we're going to explain

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.680
if wealth inequality is so important,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.400
why is it that other economists don't talk about it?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.160
Okay, so the first

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.120
reason economists don't talk about inequality

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.400
is because of the way

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
economics is taught at universities.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
So for those who don't know, I studied

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.480
maths and economics at the London School

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720
of Economics for three years, my undergrad.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.520
And then I did a two year

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.240
master's in economics at Oxford.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.040
So I've spent five years in the economics departments

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.000
learning economics

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960
and I think it's important to understand

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.120
the way that economics

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.520
is taught at universities nowadays.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400
So the first thing to say is,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200
and I think this will surprise a lot of people,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.440
in economics departments

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.200
we don't talk about the housing crisis.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
We don't talk about why housing is unaffordable.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
We don't talk about falling living standards.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.160
We don't talk about why wages are falling,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.720
why it's hard to get a good job,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840
why big cities are expensive,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.560
why things like energy

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440
and food are increasingly expensive.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.320
These kind of big economic

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.000
problems of our time

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.320
are basically not discussed at university.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.000
So what do we do at university?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.880
The main thing is we do maths.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.000
So economics nowadays is a very,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.440
very heavily mathmatised subject.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.120
If you don't have a very good maths A-level,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.880
you basically can't even get into university to do it.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.840
And then when you get into the university

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000
it's just very, very, very heavily mathematical.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.400
And once you go into postgrad especially,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.680
it's extremely, phenomenally mathematical

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
and it's not easy maths.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.840
You're doing kind of a lot of algebra,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.680
a lot of simultaneous equations.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.760
But basically it's a maths subject at this point.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160
And it's important to say that the maths is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.120
not easy.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.880
So I had a maths and economics undergrad

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.520
and I was very good at maths as a kid.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.760
But then when I went to do my postgrad at Oxford,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.920
even though I was very good at maths,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.400
I found the maths quite difficult.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.600
And if you want to succeed,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360
if you want to get good grades,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
you really, really have to spend a lot of time

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.680
memorizing the maths basically.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.280
And the context for this maths is they basically build

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.400
a model, like a model economy

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.920
and everything affects everything else.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.200
So if we cut the interest rate a bit,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.080
what does that do to GDP for example?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.920
Or if people suddenly start

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.200
spending less money trying to save more,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.760
what does that do to inflation?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.360
This kind of thing.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440
If the government suddenly raises taxes,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.520
how does that affect the economy?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.320
And you build this kind of mathematical model?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.680
It's like a kind of like a toy model,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.240
like a kind of game in a way.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.880
We raise this a little bit,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.440
that falls, this thing rises.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.880
And that's the kind of model

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.200
that is basically used in modern economics.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.680
But of course,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920
when you build a model,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.800
you can't include absolutely everything

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.760
that exists in the economy.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.640
You have to make some simplifications,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.800
some things will be included,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.560
some things will not be included.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.160
And

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600
the models which we study at universities nowadays,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.040
one of the big simplifications

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.000
is that there is no inequality in the model.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.640
In fact,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.760
it's more than just that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.880
there is no inequality in the model.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.400
There is only one person in the model.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.960
So these models are what

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680
they call representative agent models.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.600
So rather than looking at 6

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600
or 7 billion people in the world,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.400
or like 66 million people in the UK,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.360
or 300 million people in the US,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.120
they say

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.440
to make the model simpler,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.680
we are just going to look at one representative person.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.880
So the average person in the whole economy.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.680
So all you care about is averages, right?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.040
You're just looking at one average person.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.160
And of course

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.360
if we change the distribution,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.920
if I take some wealth from you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.080
and give it to Bill Gates, or if I take some wealth

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.480
from Rishi Sunak and give it to you,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.680
that changes the distribution

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.640
but doesn't change the average.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.120
So basically, once you build this model,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.040
which only looks at the representative agent,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.720
which is the average, which is the aggregate,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.560
it's not only that

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.000
there is no inequality in the model.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040
There is

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.480
not even any possibility for inequality in the model.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.760
These are models of averages.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.720
These are models of aggregates.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.640
Which is why

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.800
when modern economists

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.760
you've been to these elite universities

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.080
think about the economy,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.160
they tend to think about them

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800
in terms of averages or aggregates,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.920
so that they're obsessed with the big aggregate

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.480
measurements of the economy.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.800
For example, GDP is, of course,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.240
the classic one, unemployment,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.680
inflation, central bank interest rates,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.560
level of government

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.640
spending, level of government taxation.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.000
These are things which you can measure

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.120
on an aggregate economy.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.200
But they're nothing to do with

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.880
how is one person affected versus another person?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.960
As soon as you take a model

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.560
and you make it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.960
representative agent, a model of the average person,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.400
this model can't say anything about distribution.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.160
It can't say anything about this

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.200
group of people is winning.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240
This group of people is losing.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360
We can't say anything like that in these models.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.600
So I think this is really interesting, right.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.360
Because when you...

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.920
if you want to be like

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.440
an influential economist

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.400
in the world of policy or academia,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.680
you are going to have to have a PhD.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.160
So you're going to have to have three years undergrad,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.560
one year, I did two years master,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.640
you're going to be doing a PhD

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.040
for like three, four, five years.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.280
In the US, a PhD like seven years.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.600
You're going to have to do

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.760
like some postdoc work, and then you're going to,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.720
if you're lucky, become a junior professor.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.160
So by the time you reach a point that you are,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.680
like influential in economic policy terms.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.320
You've been studying these models

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.280
for like 15 years, like, something like that.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.320
And the fact that these models

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.680
don't include any distribution,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.800
don't include any inequality

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.400
that doesn't explicitly say, we don't think

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.880
inequality is important,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.000
but what does it do

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.600
to a person

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.880
who has devoted

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.720
most of their life to the study of economics,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.760
that that study has consisted of

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.880
10 - 15 years of very difficult

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.080
mathematical analysis, mathematical manipulation

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.440
of very difficult, very complicated mathematical models

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.480
with no inequality in them.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.200
Like, I think this is actually...

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.440
this is a very effective way

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.200
to subconsciously

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.560
convince, almost subconsciously brainwash a person

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.920
into believing that inequality doesn't matter.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.000
You never come out and explicitly say like,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.480
inequality doesn't matter.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.760
But you say like, here's

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.080
a really,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.560
really complicated game, here's

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.800
a really,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.280
really complicated mathematical model,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.200
that you're going to have to spend

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.440
15 or 20 years of your life

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.280
understanding in absolute fine detail,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.000
and you never even explicitly mention it,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080
but the model doesn't have inequality in it,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080
doesn't have any distribution.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.760
It doesn't have any space for that.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.440
So imagine you’re

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.760
that that kid, you went in 18 years old,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.200
and then you spent 15 years of your life paying,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.080
you know, locked in libraries,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.480
doing really difficult maths

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.640
with no inequality, no inequality, no inequality.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.240
And then...

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.400
first of

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.760
all, whenever you

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.200
think about what's wrong with the economy,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.760
you're going to go back to this stuff

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.480
you studied, right?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.200
And you're going to be like,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.120
maybe the problem is the interest rate is too high

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.880
or government spending is too low,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.360
or government taxation is too high.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.400
You know, you're going to focus on these things

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.080
that were in the model.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.640
You spent 20 years studying that model.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.000
Of course, you're going to want to provide answers

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that often the model that you told,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.160
the model that has been spent...

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.080
you've been spending 20 years of your life studying.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.040
But if somebody comes to you

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.080
and says, hey,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.440
maybe the problem is inequality,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.280
maybe the problem is distribution, how is that going to

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.400
affect you emotionally?

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.040
What's your emotional response to that going to be?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.080
I think you're going to get like a gut instinct,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.120
which is like, no, of course it's not.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.000
It's not that.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.480
Because if it was that,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.720
why the f**k have I spent 20 years

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.640
studying something that's not even in the model?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.560
And also

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.320
you kind of have a bit of professional skin

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.120
in this game, right?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.360
Because if this person is right

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.720
with what they're saying, that the reason

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.400
the economy gets worse and

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.680
worse is because of growing inequality,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.280
then you have spent 20 years of your life

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.880
studying something that has nothing to say

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.760
about the biggest economic issue of our time.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.760
And you are a professor now at Chicago or LSE

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.760
or some fancy university.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.760
And you've got nothing to say about this.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.200
If this is true, you're in big trouble, right?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.000
So I think this is

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.840
the current way that we teach economics

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.760
is very, very powerful

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.000
at convincing everyone who has a powerful voice

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.160
in speaking about economics,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.640
in insisting no, that's not it.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.160
That's not it, that's not it, that's not it.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.800
But the end result is, you know,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.960
most of these discussions are just,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.040
you know, ten people

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.520
with elite university degrees talking to each other.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.960
So it's not that

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.800
they even have to really deny somebody like me

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.920
who says inequality is the problem.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.080
It just never in the discussion.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.360
It's never, never in the discussion.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.240
It's a little bit like,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.200
you know, you know who Copernicus is.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.080
Copernicus, this scientist who discovered that

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.240
the earth travels around the sun

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.920
and the earth is just one of many planets

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.680
traveling around the sun.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.240
And, everybody accepts now that this is right.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.400
But before him,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.880
everybody thought that the earth

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.400
was the center of the solar system.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.160
I guess it probably wasn't

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.480
called the solar system at that time.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.600
And everything traveled around that, including the sun.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.000
And they had developed

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.960
these really complicated mathematical systems

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.880
of making that work.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.160
And the way that works is that all the other planets

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.000
they have to do, like loop

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.280
the loops and spinning around,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.680
that's the only way that it works to make sense.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.600
So what are these guys spent like their whole lives

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.400
working on these complicated mathematical models

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.000
of how everything goes around the earth,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.880
and then a guy came and said,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.960
actually things that go around the earth.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.720
And he was,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.920
you know, he was massively, massively attacked.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.240
Nobody wanted to accept it because

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.000
you have all these

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.280
prestigious academics who have spent their whole life

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.160
developing models

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.920
of how things travel around the earth.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.000
I think that's kind of basically where we are now.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.400
And if I was right in saying that,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.240
that these guys are just missing the big thing,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.120
what would you expect?

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.040
You would expect basically, that their models

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.320
wouldn't work in the sense that

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.800
they would constantly generate incorrect predictions.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.440
And that is exactly what happens.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.400
These guys consistently generate incorrect predictions.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.200
So, you know,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.840
I've spoken about it many times on this channel,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.600
and I'll speak about it

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.880
on the next video in the course.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.880
My job was

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.520
to predict interest rates, and interest rates are...

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.680
modern economists are basically obsessed

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.560
with interest rates.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.920
Before 2008,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.880
they basically thought

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.720
you could

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.800
solve pretty much any modern economic problem

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.640
by just making sure you get that interest rate right.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.440
And if you look at the way that our economists

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.080
react to financial crises and economic crises,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.240
how do they react to 2008? Sashed the interest rate.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.040
How did they react to Covid? Slashed the interest rate.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.800
How did they react to the inflationary

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.280
spike after Covid? Rocketed the interest rate up.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.600
This is basically where

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.640
our economists sit at the moment,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.440
which is the way to deal with

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.120
any economic crisis is to manipulate the interest rate.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.680
So the interest rate is like their key tool

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.160
that they use basically.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.640
And yet

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.720
what are their predictions

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.920
for their own interest rate like?

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.880
So I was an impression

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.480
interest rate trader from 2008 until 2014.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.600
In 2008, after the financial crisis,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.400
interest rates were slashed to zero

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.320
in basically the whole of the rich world.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.760
Nobody predicted that, that was a surprise.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760
And because they believe

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.600
that low interest rates

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.440
are very economically stimulative,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.720
they thought that rates would come up again

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.480
the next year.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.160
They didn't.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.080
They then said in 2009, well,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.440
we were wrong

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.040
this year, but rates will come up next year.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.880
They didn't.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.840
In 2010 they said rates will go up in 2011.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.600
They didn't.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.080
And they continued to predict rates

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.000
to go up every single year

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.160
up until 2020 in the middle of Covid.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.200
Every single one of those predictions were incorrect.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.760
And then they finally said, in the midst of Covid,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.960
now inflation is so low

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.200
and will stay so

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200
low for so long,

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.720
interest rates will never go up again,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.720
and interest rates immediately went up to 5% or 6%.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.800
So you know,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.640
I know when I come out and say

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.080
inequality is the big thing.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.600
And you live in a world

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.560
full of economists

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:01.960
that say,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.560
oh the problem is things to do with the interest rate,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.640
things to do with levels of government

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.800
spending, things to do with the level of taxation.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.920
I can sound like a bit of a quack, basically.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.840
Why is this guy

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.400
saying the problem is one thing

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.360
when all of these prestigious elite

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.040
economists aren’t mentioning it?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.200
Well,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.280
they're an educational system

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.680
which never talks about it

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.720
and their predictions are constantly wrong.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.280
Whereas if you look at my predictions and, you know,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.480
I correctly predicted interest rates

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.720
after the 2008 crisis,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.520
but I've also correctly predicted things

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.120
on this channel.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.680
If you go back and look at the first video

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.840
on this channel,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.120
which we’ll link in the description,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.800
I predicted in the beginning of Covid,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.240
there would be an inflationary crisis,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.600
a cost of living crisis,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.520
a huge spike in the stock price,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.240
the gold price, house prices

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.360
and huge increase in inequality.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.600
All of these things have happened.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.000
So I know it's easy to dismiss somebody,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.240
especially somebody who doesn't come

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.520
from a rich, privileged background saying

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.040
the elites are wrong on this,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.120
but the elites are continually

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.360
generating incorrect predictions,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.920
and I'm generating correct predictions here.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.960
So I think that

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.920
what we have at the moment is essentially

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.320
a broken education system in economics.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.280
But there's more to it than that.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.480
And the second reason

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.320
why we don't speak about inequality in economics enough

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.840
is because

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.880
we have a system

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.760
which

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.560
aggressively takes anybody who is good at predictions

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.280
out of the conversation.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.240
And to explain this,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.880
I want you to put yourself in the mind of

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.040
a young 20/21 year old

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.240
economics student,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.320
loves economics, loves the maths, studying

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.200
it loads at an elite university.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.920
You know, you graduate whatever it is, magna cum laude,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.760
or whatever,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.960
you're top of your class

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.520
and then you have to decide

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.680
what you want to do with your life.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.440
So if you want to be in this conversation,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.400
if you want to be an academic

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.680
or if you want to be advisor to government,

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.760
or if you want to work

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.200
in, you know, public policy,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.640
you had to stay in academia,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.040
you can't just do an undergrad.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.840
You're going to have to do a master's.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.960
It's going to cost you a lot of money.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.160
You go and do a PhD.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.640
You're going to have to work,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.000
spend money, locked in libraries.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.600
If you're lucky, you might start making money

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.800
in your like mid-thirties. Or you can go to the city.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.000
Not only does it pay you way, way, way more,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.840
but it gives you the opportunity to prove,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.600
look I'm good because I can make predictions.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.120
And academia doesn't really care

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.160
if you can make good predictions. So one thing which

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.120
was really clear to me in my time in the city

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.320
and my time in academia, is

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.800
if you're really, really good,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.240
you want to be in the city,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.000
because if you're making good predictions,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.120
you will be recognised,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.360
you will be paid, and everybody will know

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.040
that is the guy over there who is right,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.800
because they're really aggressively analysing

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.720
who is the guy who is making good predictions.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.240
They're tracking that and they're paying that.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.240
Whereas when I went back to academia in 2017,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.960
I had, you know, my first lecture at Oxford,

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.760
and it was about interest rates.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.800
And I thought, you know, this is really interesting.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.360
This is the thing which we've predicted really badly

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.600
for 10 - 15 years.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.760
This is at the specific area I worked in.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.280
This is the area I'm an expert on.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.600
Like it's really interesting, right?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.880
Like if you

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.440
are at an elite university

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.400
and you're studying something really important

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.120
and we've been wrong about it for 10...

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.240
at that time, it was 10 years.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.720
Now it's more like 15 years.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.120
This is interesting, right.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.880
This is like a kind of an unsolved problem.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.480
There's a thing that we're really bad at,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.360
you know, we can work out why we bad at it.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.320
So I went to the professor, I said,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.040
why do you think we've been wrong

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.680
about interest rates for ten years?

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.160
And he said,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.640
oh no, we always knew

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.520
interest rates would stay zero, which is,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.040
you know, categorically wrong.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.880
And I went back

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.200
and I showed him the data and I said,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.080
look, you're actually been wrong for ten years.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.240
And he said, oh, that's interesting.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.400
You know, it never went anywhere.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.200
So what this shows is, if you're good at predicting,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.720
which means you’re,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.000
you're good at working out other people are wrong,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.800
the city will pay you, academia won't even notice.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.080
They won't even notice.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.320
So what does this tell you

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.480
about Academia's ability to improve?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.920
Like if these guys are able to be wrong year

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.320
after year after year after year for 10 years

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.120
and not even notice

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.240
they're not going to improve,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.520
they're not going to improve basically.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.720
So what you have is a situation

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.480
where anyone who is good and wants to make money

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.920
is aggressively paid to leave.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.680
And if you're good and you stay,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.400
even if you are able to correctly identify

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.040
an area where everyone is consistently wrong,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.520
they don't really care and they're not going to listen.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.000
So what kind of person stays in academia

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.960
when they know that if they're good,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.360
they will do much better and get paid much better

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.480
leaving academia and going into finance.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.520
Basically people from rich families.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.440
It doesn't make sense to do that

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.480
if you're not from a rich family.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.240
Like if you are, if you have the option...

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.280
you know, I made millions of pounds in the city

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.280
and you know, that is what paid for this flat.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.800
And, you know,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.880
my brother needed to buy a house,

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880
I helped him, my sister's

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.560
trying to buy a house, I'm helping her.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.840
Like people from ordinary families

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.000
cannot afford to make that choice if they're good.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.040
So the kind of people who stay in academia

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.560
you need to be either

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.520
not good enough to get into finance,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.840
from a rich family, or basically a little bit mad.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.320
And this is what happens.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.520
So you have this system

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.200
which kind of brainwashes people

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.440
into saying inequality doesn't exist,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.040
it doesn't matter,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.640
doesn't listen to people who

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.000
are right and have wasted...

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.120
who are demonstrably better in their predictions

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.920
and aggressively takes everybody

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.320
who's half good out of the conversation.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.760
And if you do go into finance, obviously,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.520
then once you're in finance,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.040
you can make a lot of money making good predictions,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.360
but you're not allowed to speak publicly.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.840
So when I was a trader,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.320
I was making a lot of money

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.440
betting that inequality

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.200
would devastate living standards

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.600
and keep interest rates low

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.680
and push house prices up

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.880
and push stock prices up

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.600
and push inequality up further.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.800
But I wasn't allowed to say anything

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.720
about these things.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.600
I had another point which I need to make on this.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.840
So the third reason economists

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.800
don't talk about inequality

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.200
is that

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.960
pretty much all powerful, influential economists

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.560
are quite rich.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.360
They're quite rich,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.920
they're generally from rich families.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.160
If they weren't from rich families,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.040
they probably wouldn't have stayed in academia.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.200
Economics has the worst social representation

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.440
of, like, different social classes

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.120
of any subject in the big American universities.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.720
So you have rich people who've gone into study

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.120
this subject, they probably don't need money,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.200
otherwise they would have gone into finance.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.840
And then they get paid to work

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.680
for a think tank or work for a newspaper.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.040
And they themselves are quite rich and comfortable.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.280
The people who pay them are probably quite rich.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.640
They're heavily incentivised

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.880
not to talk about inequality, right.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880
In a quite obvious way,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.200
which is when somebody is rich and comfortable,

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.160
they want to keep things the way they are.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.040
You know, when you talk about a crisis of inequality,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.360
it hurts most people quite badly

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.320
because, wealth tends to concentrate at the very top.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.000
But there's a sort of, you know, the top

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
1% especially the top 0.1% does really, really well,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.640
but there's like 5% or 6% of the top

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.240
that benefit from that.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.560
And these guys

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.200
include basically any economist with a voice.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.760
So economists are wealthy.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.240
They don't want to do inequality.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.880
They've got a massive amount of skin in the game

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.600
saying that inequality doesn't matter.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.400
20 years,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.440
30 years of education studying something

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.480
which has nothing to say about inequality.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.960
They need this to not be a problem.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.280
Okay.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.880
So to conclude,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.000
why do economists not talk about inequality?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.160
Primarily it comes from an education system

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.440
which completely

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.600
neglects to discuss it,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.280
which means that anyone who is involved in

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.640
this discussion has studied for 20 years

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.960
without ever talking about this.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.720
So it basically indoctrinated them into believing

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.680
this is not a problem.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.040
And also they have a massive incentive

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.400
in pushing that because otherwise

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.880
their basically, their education is a waste of time.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.240
It's rich people.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.160
It works for them and their class interests.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.600
Anyone who is really good at

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.040
this is paid out of the game

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.640
and paid to keep their mouth shut.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.880
So basically they're not going to fix this.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.840
So what does that mean?

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.520
I'm filming this video at the back end of 2024.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.840
We had an election this year

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.680
in the UK, where the center left

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.320
Labour Party beat the center right Conservative Party.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.720
And I think

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.440
people often think that the reason that politicians

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.920
do nothing about inequality is because

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.560
they're representing their own interests.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.120
It's important to recognise

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.080
there's kind of this whole class

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.920
of slightly self-serving,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.240
slightly idiotic,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.800
very posh, very rich economists

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.200
that are holding this up

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.400
and they're going to do nothing about inequality.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.040
Inequality will get worse and worse.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.680
Living standards for ordinary people will fall,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.720
and these people are not going to stop it.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.960
So the responsibility has to fall upon

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.440
ordinary people themselves to stop it.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.440
When I first started talking

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.120
about these things publicly in 2020,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.720
I was writing articles for newspapers.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.040
I wrote an article for The Guardian,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.360
and,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.000
those articles are mainly being read

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.280
by quite posh, quite privileged, quite rich people.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.720
And I was convinced

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.760
that we were not going to get positive change

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.320
by talking to the group of people

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.840
who benefit from the growth in inequality.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.680
So I made consciously the switch to YouTube

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.320
to try to convince ordinary people

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.520
they need to do something.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.960
And that's why we're doing, this channel.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.000
So I would encourage people to support

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.440
keep watching these videos.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.080
I think the next video we would do on this,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.520
will be

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.440
a little bit talking about my personal experience

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.400
and how I came to become convinced

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.200
that inequality was the problem.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.920
And then we'll keep doing

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.400
different educational bits and bobs

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.520
that will build up the understanding.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.240
But that's it.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.040
Part three of the conversation -

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.360
why economists never talk about inequality.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.400
Because the universities train them not to.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.160
And because they’re very rich.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.400
And they're doing just fine, thanks. Okay. Thank you.
