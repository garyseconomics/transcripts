point raised by annabelle because i
 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.950 align:start position:0%
point raised by annabelle because i
think<00:05:06.240><c> it's</c><00:05:06.400><c> actually</c><00:05:06.639><c> really</c><00:05:06.880><c> important</c><00:05:07.360><c> to</c>

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
think it's actually really important to
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
think it's actually really important to

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
address some of the ideas behind those
 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
address some of the ideas behind those
so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.590 align:start position:0%
so
i<00:05:12.160><c> think</c><00:05:12.560><c> it's</c><00:05:12.720><c> fair</c><00:05:12.880><c> to</c><00:05:13.039><c> say</c><00:05:13.199><c> that</c><00:05:13.360><c> most</c>

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to say that most
 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.430 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to say that most
people<00:05:13.840><c> would</c><00:05:14.080><c> accept</c><00:05:14.800><c> that</c><00:05:15.039><c> those</c>

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
people would accept that those
 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
people would accept that those
who<00:05:15.680><c> run</c><00:05:15.919><c> successful</c><00:05:16.400><c> businesses</c><00:05:16.960><c> should</c><00:05:17.120><c> be</c>

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
who run successful businesses should be
 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.550 align:start position:0%
who run successful businesses should be
paid<00:05:17.520><c> more</c><00:05:17.680><c> than</c><00:05:17.919><c> average</c>

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
paid more than average
 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
paid more than average
but<00:05:18.720><c> there's</c><00:05:18.880><c> a</c><00:05:18.960><c> really</c><00:05:19.120><c> important</c><00:05:19.600><c> question</c>

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
but there's a really important question
 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.749 align:start position:0%
but there's a really important question
of<00:05:19.919><c> proportionality</c><00:05:20.880><c> here</c><00:05:21.199><c> um</c>

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
of proportionality here um
 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
of proportionality here um
so<00:05:22.000><c> it's</c><00:05:22.160><c> obviously</c><00:05:22.479><c> not</c><00:05:22.639><c> proportional</c><00:05:23.120><c> to</c>

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously not proportional to
 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.950 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously not proportional to

so and even
 

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
so and even
in<00:11:59.839><c> percentage</c><00:12:00.560><c> terms</c>

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes<00:12:03.680><c> yeah</c><00:12:04.399><c> um</c><00:12:05.360><c> and</c><00:12:05.519><c> wealth</c><00:12:05.760><c> inequality</c><00:12:06.320><c> has</c>

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
yes yeah um and wealth inequality has

yes yeah um and wealth inequality has
also<00:12:06.800><c> increased</c>

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
also increased
 

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.670 align:start position:0%
also increased
um<00:12:08.079><c> so</c><00:12:08.320><c> i</c><00:12:08.399><c> mean</c><00:12:08.800><c> there</c><00:12:08.959><c> are</c><00:12:09.040><c> lots</c><00:12:09.279><c> of</c><00:12:09.360><c> different</c>

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
um so i mean there are lots of different
 

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.829 align:start position:0%
um so i mean there are lots of different
ways<00:12:09.920><c> of</c><00:12:10.079><c> measuring</c><00:12:10.399><c> this</c>

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
ways of measuring this
 

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
ways of measuring this
um<00:12:12.959><c> so</c><00:12:14.399><c> yeah</c>

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
depending<00:12:15.519><c> on</c><00:12:15.680><c> how</c><00:12:15.839><c> you</c><00:12:16.000><c> measure</c><00:12:16.320><c> it</c><00:12:16.639><c> um</c><00:12:17.040><c> you</c>

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
depending on how you measure it um you
 

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.190 align:start position:0%
depending on how you measure it um you
can<00:12:17.279><c> come</c><00:12:17.519><c> up</c><00:12:17.600><c> with</c><00:12:17.760><c> different</c><00:12:18.079><c> conclusions</c>

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
can come up with different conclusions
 

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
can come up with different conclusions
um<00:12:19.760><c> but</c><00:12:21.040><c> the</c><00:12:21.519><c> i</c><00:12:21.600><c> mean</c><00:12:21.760><c> the</c><00:12:21.839><c> high</c><00:12:22.000><c> pay</c><00:12:22.240><c> center</c>

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um but the i mean the high pay center
 

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
um but the i mean the high pay center
looks<00:12:22.800><c> at</c><00:12:23.040><c> ceo</c>

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
looks at ceo
 

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
looks at ceo
compensation<00:12:25.279><c> and</c><00:12:25.360><c> that's</c><00:12:25.600><c> gone</c><00:12:25.839><c> up</c><00:12:26.000><c> hugely</c>

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
compensation and that's gone up hugely
 

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
compensation and that's gone up hugely
um<00:12:27.200><c> so</c><00:12:27.360><c> that</c><00:12:27.519><c> will</c><00:12:27.680><c> obviously</c><00:12:27.920><c> have</c>

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
um so that will obviously have
 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
um so that will obviously have
implications<00:12:28.880><c> for</c><00:12:29.120><c> the</c><00:12:29.279><c> wealth</c><00:12:29.600><c> of</c><00:12:29.680><c> those</c>

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.269 align:start position:0%
implications for the wealth of those
individuals<00:12:30.480><c> as</c><00:12:30.560><c> well</c><00:12:30.720><c> because</c><00:12:30.959><c> obviously</c>

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
individuals as well because obviously
 

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:31.750 align:start position:0%

when<00:12:31.440><c> you</c>

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
when you
 

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
when you
earn<00:12:32.000><c> more</c><00:12:32.399><c> you</c><00:12:33.360><c> can</c><00:12:33.519><c> therefore</c><00:12:34.079><c> invest</c><00:12:34.560><c> in</c>

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
earn more you can therefore invest in
 

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.150 align:start position:0%
earn more you can therefore invest in
in<00:12:34.959><c> assets</c><00:12:35.360><c> and</c><00:12:35.440><c> so</c><00:12:35.680><c> on</c><00:12:37.600><c> and</c><00:12:37.680><c> then</c><00:12:37.920><c> on</c><00:12:38.000><c> the</c>
