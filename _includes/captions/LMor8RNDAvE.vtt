00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.600
Okay welcome back to Gary's Economics

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.480
thank you for waiting today

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.600
we're gonna get you up to speed

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.680
with everything you missed

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.760
and talk about

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.880
how we are gonna fix this economic collapse

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.520
in the rest of 2025 welcome back

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000
okay so first thing to cover is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.040
I think to pat ourselves on the back a little bit

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.280
I've been away three months and

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.200
I was a little bit worried about taking time off

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.440
when things are blowing up

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.800
but I needn't have been because

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.440
things have gone absolutely mental

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.800
with wealth taxes and with inequality

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.880
since I've been away. Normally when I'm working

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.040
I sit here at my kitchen table and I've got a TV there

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.040
and I run BBC News or Sky News

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440
and then I have it on mute

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.200
and every single time they talk about the economy

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.040
there's a little thing at the bottom saying

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.280
wealth taxes, are we gonna get wealth taxes?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.240
Every single time

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.200
a politician is asked to talk about the economy,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.640
the political situation, they are asked

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.560
are you gonna do wealth taxes?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.080
Why are you not doing wealth taxes?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.240
Why are you not taxing the rich more?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.280
While I was away

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.360
we had the Guardian come up with an editorial piece

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.000
saying we need to have wealth taxes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Just this weekend we had Lord Kinnock

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.600
former leader of the Labour Party

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.560
asking why we're not doing wealth taxes,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.080
and yesterday we had a, well

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm shooting this on Wednesday,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.640
yesterday we had a Yougov poll coming out

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.480
saying that 75% of the country

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.120
including 62% of conservative voters

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.400
support wealth taxes.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.200
I don't wanna get too egotistical about it but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.680
this is because of us.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.840
This is because of us, this is because of me

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.240
this is because of you amplifying our message,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.480
it's not just us

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.280
we have to give like a big shout out to,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.200
other people push this Tax Justice UK especially

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.480
the Patriotic Millionaires of Becca

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.280
Gowland at PMUK does great work

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.760
Aaron Advani people like that

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.200
but this is us.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.400
We've driven this into the narrative,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.200
we are a massive massive part of the conversation now,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.480
politicians have to talk about it all the time.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.200
So just a a little moment to say well done.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.680
This channel,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560
the idea, the political idea of this channel

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.400
was always that we amplify through ordinary people

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400
we we talk to ordinary people

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.160
in a way that is understandable for ordinary people

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.400
and you guys amplify the message

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.240
you know we never done any advertising

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
and it's you that grows us

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560
so first things first, like well done

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.040
like we've massively

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.400
we've changed the game on this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.680
you know, we are the new Rupert Murdoch,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.720
we are we are dominating the debate

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.560
and we've done it through

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.080
videos of me sitting here in my kitchen.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080
But it's more because of you guys who watch it so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600
thank you very much

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.200
let's keep doing it. We're back now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720
hopefully for the rest of the year

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.440
so let's keep pushing this through.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.880
So let's catch up a little bit with the broad economic

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.000
political situation

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.280
the reason that wealth taxes have become like

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.360
relevant is because the economy is shit,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.600
and the economy is shit in exactly the way

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.280
which I said it would be shit

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.320
before the new government came in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.160
and to be honest

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.200
this is relevant even if you're in the US

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.800
or or in other countries.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.680
I would like to add the last three months

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.600
I've been like traveling the world

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.400
and I've been doing events

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400
talking about politics and about economics

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.840
and the same things are happening everywhere

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.160
so what I'm about to say is,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.000
it's not just relevant to the UK or the US

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.200
basically everywhere you have the same situation

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.840
which is there's kind of like two flavors of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.960
of government that you have at the moment

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.800
which is either this kind of like boring centrist,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.280
let's just be more efficient

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.600
let's just be more practical and sensible

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.160
and somehow that will fix things

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.240
and you have this like

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.480
kind of increasingly mentalist far right

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.360
which is just like going crazy

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.840
doing a lot of crazy shit

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.200
but aggressively blaming immigrants and foreigners

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.200
and you know

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.480
these two kind of

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.080
flavours of modern government are like

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.360
really typified by, at the moment

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.760
the Keir Starmer Labour government here in the UK

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.480
and the Donald Trump

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.640
Republican government over in the US.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.400
And I came up before those guys came in and I said,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400
or it might have been just after,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.000
basically said what you have here

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.040
is something really interesting

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.360
because you've got these two

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.480
kind of opposite flavours of government

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.800
which is your like very sort of sensible

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.760
practical traditional, centrist

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.840
Keir Starmer government and this kind of like wild

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.960
far right, alt right

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.680
whatever you want to call them

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.800
Donald Trump government

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.920
that are kind of set up as opposites

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.120
but they will both fail on the economy

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.640
because both of them are failing to recognise the key

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.040
fundamental economic problem that you have

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.280
which is that wealth inequality is growing very very

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.800
very very quickly

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.680
that the rich

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.240
and the super rich are growing their wealth

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.480
very aggressively

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.680
that is squeezing out and bankrupting governments

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.440
and that is squeezing out

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.160
and bankrupting the middle class

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.480
and because wealth taxes

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.800
and tax on the super rich are not really on the table

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.680
you end up with the situation

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.200
you have, governments who have collapsed their wealth,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.480
given away all of their wealth,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.840
are hugely in debt

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.880
turning to a middle class

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.040
who is also quite aggressively losing its wealth

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.440
and saying well

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.360
you need to pay more and absolutely refusing to

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.760
look at this group of people who

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.400
are just absolutely squeezing everybody else out

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.360
and it's gonna fail basically

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.960
you know this is like if you have

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you know you've got a patient on the operating table

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.400
and they're hemorrhaging blood

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800
the government is hemorrhaging wealth

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.400
the middle class is hemorrhaging wealth

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960
and you you try to fix it

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.200
without stopping that hemorrhaging of wealth

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.000
you know the boat

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.640
the boat has a hole in the bottom

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.880
and you're not gonna fix it by rowing faster

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.840
and you're not gonna fix it by blaming immigrants

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440
until we stop the middle class

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.200
the working class and the governments

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.000
from having all of their wealth

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.360
squeezed out of them by the very rich

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.360
we will continue to see economic worsening

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.840
and this is why I was able to predict that Rishi Sunak

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.960
would fail economically

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.720
that Keir Starmer would fail economically

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.920
that Donald Trump would fail economically,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.880
despite these three guys, Sunak and Starmer and Trump

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.360
being very different politicians

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.080
and it's really just for a very simple reason

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.080
which is the core of the economic crisis

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.640
is growing wealth inequality

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640
and none of these politicians

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.560
none of these political ideologies

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.280
are willing to even really talk about inequality

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.760
and in fact in many cases

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.200
especially the case of Donald Trump

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.720
and the more far right parties

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.200
they're actively cutting taxes on billionaires.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.680
So you know

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.160
what you have here is an economy with cancer

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.400
and a bunch of politicians who don't believe in cancer.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.280
So it doesn't matter if it's Starmer on the tin

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.000
or Trump on the tin,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.880
they're gonna fail

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.960
they're gonna fail unless they deal with

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.560
economic inequality

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.440
which is a big problem

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.640
because they're not addressing it.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.600
But it creates this massive

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.960
massive political opportunity

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.600
which is that what you will see

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.280
what we are seeing, what we will continue to see

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.400
is continued economic failures

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.560
of different governments

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.800
because they refuse to deal with the actual problem.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.760
In many cases

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.600
I think they don't,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.760
they don't recognise the importance of inequality

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.280
as the actual problem

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.640
and if you wanna understand specifically

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.600
why it is that governments

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.240
and politicians

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.400
and economists don't realize why economics is

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.600
why inequality is the problem

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.400
we do have a video on the channel called

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.440
Understanding Why Economists Ignore Inequality.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.200
We'll put that in the in the description at the bottom

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.960
but basically these guys will fail again and again

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.600
and it puts us in a great position

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600
because we can correctly predict that.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600
So I came in before Starmer came in

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.560
saying that he would win and he would

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.000
fail really badly on the economy

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.800
and he would be very unpopular.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.040
I said the same thing about Sunak

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.800
I said the same thing about Trump

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.840
and it also creates this

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.240
massive demand for something new

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.440
because people don't want to live in poverty

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.400
people don't want their kids to live in poverty

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.560
but it's increasingly clear to ordinary people

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.600
that is what is happening

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.960
that they're being impoverished

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.840
and it creates this massive demand

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.360
for new economic ideas which I think we

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.000
here on this YouTube channel are filling, really

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.320
and I think that's one of the reasons why this channel

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.600
has become so so big and

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
and so popular

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.160
and when I was traveling around the world

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.080
I realised that it's

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.480
it's like popular all over the world really

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.800
which is kind of crazy

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.600
but that's because these

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.040
these problems are happening everywhere

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.720
so there's massive opportunity,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.800
I'm back now we're gonna make videos

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.480
we're gonna try to drive into that space

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.720
I think there's such a massive gap

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.200
to explain to people what's happening

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.360
in the economy and that gap is only gonna grow

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.280
as the economy gets worse and worse

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.840
but that opportunity which is there for us

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.000
to explain why economic worsening is happening

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.680
is not just being exploited by us here on this channel

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.960
it's also being exploited by the far right and

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.800
I think it's interesting to consider

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.440
what will happen politically

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.320
and how these two different political ideologies

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.680
will respond to

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.240
continuing aggressive economic worsening

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.600
worsening of living standards

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.040
so when you consider these kind of like

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.720
centrist governments

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.320
and I think that includes

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.480
not just governments like Starmer and Labour

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.320
and Biden and the Democrats

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.920
but also for example

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.800
the Rishi Sunak Conservative government was

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800
more or less a kind of boring centrist government

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.040
economically, when they fail on the economy

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.040
they are really quite fucked to be honest

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.200
because when your position is this kind of like

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.200
radical centrism and your offer is just

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.760
we're gonna be really sensible,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.600
when you try to be really sensible

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.280
and the economy fails

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.000
you basically don't have anywhere to move.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.800
These guys

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.560
continually find themselves in the same situation

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.800
which is they make promises,

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.600
they enter government, they realise

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.720
that the government's given all of its wealth away

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.080
they turn to the middle class

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.800
who have also not had their wealth protected

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.440
and then they just basically say

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.000
we're fucked

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.880
we're gonna just basically shut the welfare state down

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.680
and then that makes them very unpopular

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.840
these centrists have have not really got anywhere to go

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.400
and that is a problem because the new right

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400
the far right whatever you wanna call them

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.760
they do have somewhere to go

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.480
which is it's really

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.560
really obvious what these guys are gonna do

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.600
when they fail on the economy

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.440
and Donald Trump will fail on the economy

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.080
if he's judged by broad living standards

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
because he's not dealing with the growing inequality

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.160
they they have people to blame right

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.520
they say we were stopped by the centrists

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.800
we were stopped by the academics

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.840
the Supreme Court, the media

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.920
these negative elements within our society

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.360
they didn't allow us to be aggressive enough on

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.880
immigration and foreigners

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.560
and then you,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.200
you shift further to the right

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.960
and you have that space to move into

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.880
and you really see that here in this country

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.520
We had the Cameron/Osborne government

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.640
who were not aggressively far right

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.320
especially on social issues

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.160
they failed on on the economy

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.480
and they were replaced by Boris Johnson

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.360
who was further to the right

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.680
on these social issues and then he again

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.840
failed on the economy and he was replaced,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.800
well it looks like he will be replaced by Nigel Farage

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.560
who is further to

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.840
the right on these social issues

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.600
and basically this will keep happening

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.880
you will see this flip flop

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.360
which is the centre fails on the economy

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.240
because they failed to deal with inequality

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.080
they're replaced by someone on the right

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.400
they fail because

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.000
they fail to deal with growing inequality

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.960
in the economy

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.960
and they're replaced either by someone in the centre

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.400
or somebody further right

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.640
because you you need

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.520
when you can see that the status quo is failing

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.200
you always need to be able to sell yourself politically

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.040
as something new and I think unless really

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.280
the centre or something on the left is able to come up

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.800
and actually deal with this rapidly growing inequality

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.000
which is crushing the middle class

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.120
and crushing governments

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.120
it is inevitable that we will see a progression

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.280
of further and further right governments

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.000
and I'm not saying that Farage or Trump are fascists

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.800
uh if you wanna say that

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800
that's up to you

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.120
if we don't fix the economic problem

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.240
we will inevitably get further

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.760
and further and further to the right

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.840
governments that are more and more extreme

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.160
because

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.600
it's the only way that politicians can sell themselves

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.080
as new and sell themselves as believably

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.160
being able to fix the economic problem.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.640
So at this point

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.640
I would like to send a message out to the Labour Party

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.800
look look

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.640
I don't hate you

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
I don't know what you guys feel about me

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.240
I don't want this country to go to shit

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.600
and I don't want this country to descend into like

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.200
extreme fascism

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.840
and I'm not saying that's what Farage is

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.440
but I know that that's where we will go

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.160
if we don't fix this economic problem

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.760
you guys won election one year ago

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.200
you've got four years until the next election

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.640
listen I don't know what you think about me

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.920
I've got a very long track record of good predicting

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.760
I get paid millions of pounds by banks

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.560
to tell them this stuff

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.920
I'm telling this to you for free

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.600
if you do not deal with this

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.280
rapidly growing inequality of wealth

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.400
the economy will collapse

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.200
and you guys will get absolutely smashed

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.760
at the next election but more importantly than that

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.440
this country will collapse into desperate

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.800
desperate poverty I don't want that to happen

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.080
and I'm hoping that you don't want that to happen

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.640
this week I've sent a few emails out to guys in Labour

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.160
I've tried to set up a few meetings

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.960
so we can go and speak to them

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.000
to see if they're interested in fixing this problem

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.160
I've got to be honest

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.800
I'm not super confident that the guys I've spoken to

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.560
are gonna be able or willing

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.680
to seriously think about fixing this problem.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.000
iI there's anyone out there,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.640
one MP in the Labour Party

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.400
who doesn't want the country to go to shit

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.080
then fucking send me an email alright

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.720
because at the end of the day

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.280
I'm a Youtuber

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.200
this channel is probably gonna get bigger and bigger

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.400
and bigger

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.840
coming up to the next election

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.280
I'm gonna try and make it so you fucking need us

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.600
but more importantly

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.200
I don't want the country to collapse

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.600
if there's one single MP out there in Labour

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.000
that doesn't want the country to collapse

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.960
get in touch because the truth of the matter is

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.000
if Labour doesn't deal with this

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.360
which it looks like they won't

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.040
the economy will get worse and worse

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.800
and worse and worse Labour will get more and more

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.360
and more and more unpopular

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.360
Starmer will get more and more unpopular

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.120
Reeves will get more and more unpopular

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.400
they will end up in a position

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.960
where they will probably be forced to do a massive

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.560
rebrand and probably change leadership

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
before the next election

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.040
and I want that

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.360
new leader, and it doesn't have to be a new leader

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.400
by the way, listen, Starmer

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.000
if you're out there

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.480
I'll be happy to work with you, you know

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.840
it's my country too you know

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.800
I don't want it to go to shit and and I hope you don't.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.600
Whoever is in charge of the Labour Party

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.920
going to the next election

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.400
if we do not have an offer on the table

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.840
that is serious about reducing inequality

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.200
then it will be Farage

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.800
it will be Reform and I worry about what that means so

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.040
as this channel grows and grows

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.160
we become more and more politically powerful.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.400
After this video

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.360
we'll be doing a lot more economics explainers

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.760
we're gonna do one on housing,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.440
why housing is expensive next week

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.560
but we do have to sort of recognize what we are

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.840
I don't do this channel

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.880
just because I like talking about the economy

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.280
I do it cos I don't want the economy to collapse

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.000
and for whatever you or I might think

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.960
because of the political system

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.600
we have in this country I don't see any realistic way

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.600
of fixing the economy without going through Labour

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.040
and it doesn't mean I won't talk to the greens

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.800
or anyone else who,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.400
or the Liberal Democrats

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.040
or even conservatives or Reform

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.240
but I think our best chance

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.200
is to try to get Labour to not be so aggressively shit

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.960
so I'm here if you want to talk to me.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.560
OK so on that message

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.200
on a message to Labour

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.040
I wanna send out a few more messages to people

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.160
just here at the beginning of what I'm gonna call the

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.960
the summer autumn season

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.560
summer autumn 2025 season of Gary's Economics

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.880
the first thing to say is

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.840
you know I...

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.800
when I started this channel doing videos in my mate

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480
Simran's garden

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.800
I never thought that it would really come to anything

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.760
and I didn't think we really had much chance of winning

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.360
but I thought it was important to do

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.640
and Simran always thought we had a good chance

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.680
I think we might win this

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.240
The speed of the growth is absolutely incredible

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.200
and you know

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.200
we've already had our big press campaigns with the book

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.600
last year and this year and

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:50.880
you know

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.040
maybe it's gonna struggle without those press campaigns

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.280
we've got some cool stuff,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.600
some TV stuff like lined up for like this year,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.680
or it might come out early next year

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.200
which I'm hoping will bring more

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.000
bring more attention

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.360
but I think we've got a massive chance.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.320
I think it should be obvious

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.560
that social media is becoming

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.600
and is going to become more and more powerful in

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.200
in the realm of mainstream politics

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.840
and the traditional political parties

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.360
and also

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.680
a lot of the traditional media have been super

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.160
super slow to move on that

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.560
I heard that the other day

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.000
that Nigel Farage has more TikTok

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.800
followers than all of the rest of the other 649 MPs

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.640
put together.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.600
Politics and media has been slow to adapt to the demand

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.760
for politics and economics on social media

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.360
and we're here, we're here

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.200
we must be one of the biggest politics

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.560
economics social media platforms in Europe

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.000
we're growing super quickly

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.480
we already dominate the debate

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.080
I think we can win, I think we can win

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.040
I think we've got a chance

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.240
so stick it out, stick in

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.840
keep following. I'm hoping to keep making videos

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.800
as good this season as they were last season

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.160
but I wanted to send a message to

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.480
all my international viewers

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.800
because in the last three months

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.640
I've been all over the world

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.280
I was in Japan

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.520
Korea

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.360
Italy, Portugal

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.680
Sweden and Norway

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.920
and I did events in almost all of those countries.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.840
Everybody's got the same problems

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.160
I know we're mainly watched in the UK and the US

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.440
but the truth is we are getting closer and closer

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.240
to actually getting some kind of implementation

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.920
of a fairer tax system here in the UK

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.560
not just because of this channel

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.240
but because of the work of what we do here

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.280
and other great campaigners here in the UK

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.520
we are not the center of the world anymore

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.760
this is gonna be very very difficult to fix just here

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.840
just in the UK. It's gonna be much

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840
much easier

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.400
if we have other countries willing to help us

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.800
protect ourselves from billionaires all over the world

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.200
so you know I'd like to reach out to

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.400
all of the people who watch in other countries

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.000
thank you very much for your support

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.400
please try and build up this message

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.640
in the countries that you're in

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.120
it's a very simple message,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.400
the reason for falling living standards is growing

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.480
wealth inequality

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.880
government and the middle class are being squeezed out

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.000
that inequality is continuing to grow rapidly

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.960
if you don't do anything about it

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.000
then living standards

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.320
and the economy will continue to collapse.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.600
You need to understand that in your country

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.720
as well as in my country,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.200
if we build this message up

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.960
we can stop it. The last time

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.040
we significantly reduced inequality

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.840
in the western world it wasn't done just here in the UK

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.160
it was done across Europe

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.000
including the US and including places like Japan.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.200
We did it together

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.200
and I think we can do it together again.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.200
If you're interested in seeing some of my interviews

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.800
across the world

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.960
I think there's one of my interviews in Portugal

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.200
one of my interviews in Italy

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.880
and one of my interviews in Japan

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.600
including a section of me speaking Japanese are all up

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.880
I'll put them

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.280
I'll put them up in the comments.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.880
I wanted to send a message out to

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.480
people that are voting

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.760
or considering voting for the far right parties

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.080
Reform, Donald Trump

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.920
whatever, Chega in Portugal

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.240
they're all over the place.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.960
You know who they are, you've got one in your country

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.880
look you know

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.080
I know I get branded as a

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.120
as a communist and shit like that

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.480
I don't hate you

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.240
if you're trying to vote for these people

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.640
if you're considering voting for these people

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.080
like I know the message is going out there

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.000
that the reason you’re poor is immigrants

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.400
the reason you’re poor is foreigners

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.640
I know that message goes out again and again

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.600
and again and again

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.680
and I know that ordinary people are struggling

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.000
and they're worried about the future and

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.440
and their financial position

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.360
and the financial positions of their kids

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.200
and their grandkids, and I'm worried as well

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.680
I don't come from a rich background

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.800
I know what life is like for ordinary people

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.960
and I know it's a lot of ordinary

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.440
poor people that are voting for these guys

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.400
I don't hate you, I do this for you

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.160
I don't need to do this you know

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.760
I'm financially secure, and if you want low immigration

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.560
you have every right to ask for that

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.040
but before you consider voting for far right parties

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.880
I want you to always ask yourself two questions.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.080
Who funds these guys?

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.840
And what are they gonna do to billionaire taxes?

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.080
because in almost every case

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.200
you will find that

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.680
these guys are funded by billionaires

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.160
and are trying to cut billionaire taxes

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.040
these billionaires are the guys who are gonna own

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.120
the houses that your kids need

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.640
they are the guys that are taking

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.680
the wealth that your government used to have

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.960
they are the guys that are bankrupting your countries

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.520
and your welfare state. Listen

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.240
I'm not here to talk about immigration

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.320
I'm not an immigration economist

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.840
I'm an inequality economist

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.280
and you can have whatever level of immigration

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.800
that you like seriously

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.760
but please

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.440
don't vote for billionaires who are gonna bankrupt you.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.280
OK I wanted to send out two more short messages

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.200
I wanted to send one to the working class

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.440
that don't trust the middle class. Listen

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.160
I come from a working class background and you know

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.480
now I like move in some fancy circles sometimes

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.840
when I have to and

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.040
sometimes I don't trust them either

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.400
I know they can be kind of dickheads

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.840
and they can sometimes be quite annoying.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.600
You're not gonna get out of this without their support

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.280
There's gonna be a lot of the media

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.400
trying to make you hate people

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.080
a bit richer than you, a bit posher than you

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.360
and I know that

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.480
you are the guys who are on the front line

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.840
and you are the guys who are getting hurt.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.640
If the working class

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.440
and the middle class can't stand together

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.920
then the rich and the super rich will win

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200
so stay cool yeah

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.400
don't worry I see you.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.800
And to the middle class

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.840
that don't trust the working class, listen

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.600
you know

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.000
I know you guys might not be in the sharp end of it now

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160
but once the rich have taken

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.240
all the wealth of the government

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.760
and all the wealth of the poor

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.640
whose wealth do you think they're gonna take next

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.440
you know

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.480
don't be stupid

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
don't be stupid.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.040
OK finally,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.400
just for I end

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.040
I wanted to send a message to the rich and

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.560
and the super rich because

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.040
you know

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.200
as this channel has grown and as my message has grown

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.160
and as this wealth tax stuff has grown

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.760
there has been inevitably a lot of pushback

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.720
and I know that a lot of that pushback

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.040
comes from rich and super rich people

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.680
or is ultimately funded by rich and super rich people

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.400
and I know why you do that

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.000
because you don't wanna pay higher taxes

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.440
I understand, I don't wanna pay higher taxes either

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.680
I don't like it

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.800
if you are rich or if you are super rich

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.800
you have a nice life right

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800
you know I've seen how you guys live

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.400
and I know you know how you live right

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.760
it's nice you know

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.400
you guys get a lot of luxury, and it's cool

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.760
by pushing this further and further and further

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.440
and taking more and more and more

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.160
you are aggressively destabilising the economies

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.360
and political systems of the countries

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.440
which you live in and which give you extreme luxury,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080
what the fuck are you doing?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.560
It's enough, it's enough

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.080
and you know

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.120
we have these stories in history

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.040
I don't know how true they are

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.880
that you know

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.720
when the British elites got so rich

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.800
they eventually decided to do things

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.240
like more philanthropy and

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.560
you know

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.880
help set up the welfare state and help protect the poor

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.680
and for that reason you know

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.960
they were able to protect

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.840
the political stability of the countries they lived in

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.960
whereas the French elites

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.440
they didn't give anything back

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.040
they did all their let them eat cake shit

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.680
and they get their heads chopped off

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.040
look I ain't trying to cut nobody's heads off

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.960
You've got enough, if you keep pushing

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.800
you will destabilise the countries

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.440
that give you these enormous amounts of wealth,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.520
look at what happened in history

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.960
look at what happened in the 20th century

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.200
I'm not trying to redistribute wealth

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.320
away from the rich

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.400
I'm trying to stop the redistribution

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.920
that is bankrupting ordinary people.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.360
Listen I'm out here with my white flag up

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.680
I would accept a peace treaty

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.400
let's stop it now. If you keep pushing under this system

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.640
where you don't pay tax and the poor pay tax

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.080
and you increasingly take everything

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.840
and bankrupt everybody else

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.200
you will destroy the political stability

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.000
of this country

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.440
so stop finding dickheads to argue me on the news.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.920
OK that's it

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
that's the end of this week's video

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.960
not a lot of economics in this week's video

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.760
but um we're gonna

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.160
come back

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.040
with the same kind of stuff that we've always done

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.600
Next week

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.600
I wanna do a video on why housing is so expensive

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.080
which I think is one we haven't covered for ages

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.880
it's really really important

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.760
my plan this year is to run through

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760
till the end of the year

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.000
I've got like some TV shit I'm working on as well

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.760
it's keeping me busy

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.200
but if my mental health holds up

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.600
and I don't get assassinated by the Financial Times

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.680
We will be back

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.040
running these videos till the end of the year

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080
Shit’s gonna be hard, stay cool

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.960
be there for each other

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.320
what I would like you to do is just

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.560
stick to the message one simple clear economic message

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.640
the reason for growing poverty

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.280
the reason for falling living standards

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.120
is growing wealth inequality

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.800
that is worsening rapidly

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.160
if we don't deal with it things get worse

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.640
we can deal with it, it's possible, tax the rich more

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.400
Tax wealth not work

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.880
Welcome back hope you're enjoying summer, thank you
