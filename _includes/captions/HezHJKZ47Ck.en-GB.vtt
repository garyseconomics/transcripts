00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Today, we are going to teach you some game theory.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.480
Learning about game theory can teach us a lot about,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.080
number one, how modern economists think.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.560
And number two,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.360
I've been thinking about it a lot recently

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.400
with regards to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.080
difficulties I've been having and difficulties

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.280
I think we are going to have

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.600
with regards to fixing our economic system.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.760
So we're going to go through that today.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.720
Okay, so first,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.400
a very quick introduction of what game theory is.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.440
So game theory is a very popular field of economics.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.360
Well,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.600
it's a field of mathematics, really,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.440
which is popular nowadays in economics,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.880
where you

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.160
basically turn real life situations into gains.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.840
You say there's a certain number of players,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.000
maybe you and me, a two player game.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.240
We make moves,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.400
we play against each other and we get outcomes.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.360
And through game theory,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.400
we can analyse what you're going to do,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.160
what I'm going to do,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.960
what you should do,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.760
what I should do,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.480
and hopefully we play the game better.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.480
What I'm going to do today

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.840
is I'm going to explain to you the simplest

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.880
and probably most famous game in game theory,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520
which is called The Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.960
Now, this is a super popular game

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.680
and it's been used by a lot of economists

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560
to basically defend the idea that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.400
people are selfish.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
And the best way to understand is to explain the game.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.320
Okay, so in The Prisoner's Dilemma,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.040
you've got two prisoner's

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.000
they've been arrested for doing something wrong.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.280
It could be anything.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.720
Let's assume they've been arrested

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.680
for running a YouTube channel

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.280
that says the government is full of idiots

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.360
and the police are sitting

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.800
these two prisoners down in separate rooms,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.960
and they've got a little bit of evidence

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.920
on both of these prisoners,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.880
but not enough to really,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.320
really hit them, put them in prison for a long time.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520
So what they're trying to do is, they're trying to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.160
get both of the prisoners

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.880
to grass on each other,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.400
to give information on one another.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.760
And the way they do that is they say,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560
listen, if you grass on

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.840
your friend, the other prisoner,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600
then we’ll reduce your prison time.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.200
And the way that they set this game up is like this.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.240
Okay, so there's two players in this game.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320
Let's assume it's you and me.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.440
So

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.360
you and me

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.360
and basically we only have...

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.720
It's a very, very simple game.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.480
We only have one choice to make each,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.120
which is whether or not we grass on each other.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.640
And that means

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.760
there are four possible outcomes in this game,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.120
which is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.600
either we both grass

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.040
or we both stay silent

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.280
or you grass and I stay silent or I grass

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.680
and you stay silent.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.960
So I'm drawing out a diagram here,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.000
which basically covers

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.040
all the four situations in the game,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.240
and we can view it as basically a move from you.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.880
So in this diagram,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.120
your two options are listed here on the top.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.040
Grass on the left, stay silent on the right.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.480
My two options are listed down the side.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.400
Grass on the top, stay silent on the bottom.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.000
So this covers all the four situations.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.200
And the police have set it up

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.000
so that they want you to grass.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.840
So they say to you, if you grass

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.240
and your friend doesn't grass,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.720
So I don’t grass, we’ll

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.080
let you go away completely free

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.000
and we'll send your friend to jail for ten years.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.800
So this is the situation here where you grass

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120
and I stay silent. So it's this bottom left situation.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.880
And in that case

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.040
they give you zero years and they give me ten years

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.760
and they make the same offer to me.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.680
So if I grass and you stay silent, you'll get ten years

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.760
and I'll get zero years.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.000
If we both stay silent, then they don't have much

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.240
evidence on us at all.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.480
So they can only give us one year each.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.840
So that's this bottom right corner.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.440
We both stay silent. You one year, me one year.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.800
If we both grass,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.520
then they've got a lot of evidence on both of us

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.880
and they'll put us both in jail for five years.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120
That's this top left corner, we both grass.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.480
Okay, so now we've got the basic set-up of the game.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480
We can start to analyse it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.800
from a game theory perspective.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.920
And what game theory will tell us to do is

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.240
consider your situation.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.720
Now, you could be in one of two situations.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.280
Situation number one is I'm grassing on you.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.240
And situation number two is I'm silent

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.800
and I'm not grassing on you.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.680
So you analyse what you should do in both situations.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.640
Now consider I'm grassing on you.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.360
Now you have a choice.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.080
Either you grass on me and you get five years

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.720
or you don't grass on me and you get ten years.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720
So what game theory will say is, now

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.680
we've really simplified this game.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.520
If Gary grasses on you,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.680
your choice is five years

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.000
in prison or ten years in prison.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.480
Obviously, five years is better,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.160
so if I grass on you, you should grass.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.080
That's your strategy.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.040
If Gary grasses, you should grass.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.960
Now situation number two.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.640
What if Gary stays silent. Well now you have a choice.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.560
Either you grass on me

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.760
and you get zero years in prison, you get to go free

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.240
or you don't grass on me

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.920
and you get one year in prison.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.240
Now you have a choice.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.800
Zero years in prison or one year in prison.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.120
Zero years in prison

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.600
is obviously better than one year in prison.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.120
So again, you should grass.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.040
So in both situations, whether I grass on you

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.080
or I don't grass on you,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.560
you should grass on me

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120
because you will get less time in prison.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.320
So that means we have

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.520
what game theorists would call a dominant strategy.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.400
Whatever I do, you should grass on me.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.240
Grassing on me is

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.240
the best outcome for you, regardless of my action.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.000
So according to economists, game theorists,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.080
you should definitely grass on me,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.760
that is your dominant strategy.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040
Now, of course, this game is totally symmetrical,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.280
so if we analyse the game from my perspective,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.200
it will be exactly the same analysis

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.800
as what we just went through now.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.280
So that means obviously

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.800
I also have a dominant strategy.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.160
Whatever you do, I should grass on you.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.400
And whatever I do, you should grass on me.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.280
This means that we have what in game theory

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.760
they call a Nash equilibrium,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.520
which is named after the insane

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280
mathematician John Nash.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.560
Which means, I definitely know what I'm going to do

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.000
because I'm going to grass on you whatever.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.440
You definitely know what you're going to do.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.960
You're going to grass on me or whatever.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.240
So we will both definitely grass on each other.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.280
I can't change what you do.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.480
You can't change what I do. It's a stable equilibrium.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.160
We will both grass and each other.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.040
We will end up here in the top left box

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.480
where we both get five years in prison.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.920
Now, what's interesting about

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.040
this game is there's another box.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.360
This bottom right corner

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.360
where if we both stay silent.,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.760
it would have been better for both of us.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.640
I would have got one year, you would have got one year.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.040
As it is, we're both grassing, we’re

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.920
both getting five years.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.760
So we've ended up in a pretty bad situation.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.920
So it's interesting, right?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880
Why does it happen

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.720
that we end up in this bad situation?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.760
Why can't we just both not grass

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.280
and be in a better situation?

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.280
The reason for that is we've done the analysis.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.400
If I know you're not grassing,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.360
it's better for me to grass.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.280
So I'm going to grass anyway

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.640
and you're in the same situation.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.160
If you know I'm not grassing, you're going to grass.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.560
So basically we can't trust each other

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.920
because we're both selfish.,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920
we're both going to grass off

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.560
and the end result is we're going to get a bad outcome

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.960
for both of us. Now, this is

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.760
the most famous game in game theory,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.720
and it's often used by game theorists, micro economists

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.560
to basically justify the idea that people are selfish

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.560
and that basically f*cks us up because we're selfish.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.160
But there's nothing you can do about it

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.520
because people are selfish.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.960
And I think this analysis and

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.240
people who are very good at game theory

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.800
probably shouldn't be making this analysis.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.080
I think it's really interesting

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.600
and I want to explain to you why.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.160
So

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.440
we are ending up in the bad outcome

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.440
because we both selfishly chose to grass

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.560
and there's nothing we can do about that

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.440
because people are selfish, right?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.040
But actually the reason this happened is because

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.680
we when we did the game theory,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680
we assumed that

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.160
and we never spoke about this assumption.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160
I never mentioned the assumption

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.480
when we went through the game,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.240
we assumed that

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.000
both players act in such a way

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.200
that the only thing they care about

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.560
is reducing their prison time.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.080
So actually, when we went through the analysis,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.600
we kind of assumed that the players were selfish.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.800
In reality, if you were

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.480
in this situation with your friend,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.160
you might say, well,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
you know, I don't want to betray my friend,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.080
or I trust that my friend is not going to grass me up.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.520
So I'm not going to...

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.800
I'm not going to betray him

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.800
because he's my friend and I trust him.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.520
But we didn't talk about

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.160
this at all in our analysis, right?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.120
There are many situations

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.160
where this game has been tried out in game shows or in

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.360
economists experiments.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.000
And what you find is actually a lot of people

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.840
in this kind of situation,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.080
they won't betray their friend.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.800
They will

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.360
stick with their friend because they like them

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.280
or because they trust them

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.960
or because they think they can get the better

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.280
outcome by sticking together.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.200
So actually,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.000
the people who have kind of proved themselves

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.320
to be selfish in this analysis,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.640
in this analysis are the economists themselves.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.680
It was the economists

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.760
that said you would definitely betray your friend

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.880
because the only thing you care about

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.600
is your prison time. And that analysis is correct.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.360
If the only thing you care about

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.080
in the whole world

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.040
is reducing your prison time in this game,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.880
you should definitely betray your friend. That is true.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.400
But the analysis that we did that we will both grass

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.680
that answer, that equilibrium, that response

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.600
only becomes correct if we make that assumption.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.120
So if we assume selfishness,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.640
we get selfish outcomes, which may be bad.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.120
In reality,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.840
this game does nothing to tell us

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.600
whether people are selfish or not.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.800
It only tells us that,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.080
here is a game where the correct strategy

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.280
if the only thing you care about

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.680
is reducing your prison time, is to be selfish. So

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.080
this is my first conclusion here.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.920
Anyone who ever says that game theory

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.880
suggests that people are selfish

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.520
basically doesn't understand game theory.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.520
Game theory can tell you what to do if we know exactly

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.080
what you want.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.760
If we know what you want, we can tell you what to do.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.240
If we know that you’re selfish,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.480
we can tell you which outcome

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.360
sorry, which strategy is probably going

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.320
to give you the best selfish outcome.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.360
If you're not selfish, if you care about other people,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.280
then you can probably work together

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.840
and you can probably get towards

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.760
this good outcome of only

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760
getting one year in prison each.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.560
But that only works

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.680
if you have a degree of non selfishness.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.640
Now I want to get onto

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.280
the reason I've been thinking about this

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.240
a lot recently.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.400
Now, the reason for that is,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.080
as you know, I've been running this YouTube

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.680
channel for three, more than three years now,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.480
and the main idea behind this YouTube channel is that

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.560
the economy as it is, is in a really bad situation.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.240
Living standards

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.520
for ordinary families are

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.760
getting worse and worse quite quickly

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.040
and they will continue to get worse.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.320
And what I continually say on this channel is that

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.520
if we get together

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.200
and force

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.480
politicians to tax the rich more aggressively

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.360
to force wealth to flow

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.320
to ordinary people

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.280
rather than away from ordinary people,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.920
we can make inequality come down.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.400
We can make the economy better,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.440
and we can make living standards

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.000
better for ordinary people.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.360
And yet, when I speak to politicians about this idea,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.160
including politicians who are

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.480
on the left, like politicians in the Labour Party,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.960
very often they say to me, you know,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.640
we can't publicly support these kinds of ideas

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.560
because they're not popular, because

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.240
they're not vote winners.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.840
And when I publicly speak about these ideas,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.000
I very often get people

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.280
push back against me and say, oh,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.200
we basically, we don't want to believe that's true.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.000
And when I get these kind of responses,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.760
what I often feel is

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.000
especially when I'm talking to better off people,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.320
these are people who are busy people, good jobs,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.760
good salaries,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.120
and they basically have a choice to make

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.760
when they hear my theories, which is do I

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.000
believe this guy? Do I agree with this guy, and do I

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.440
start to devote some of my time

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.640
some of my energy towards

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.280
basically helping him achieve his goals?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.680
Or do I ignore it and say, listen, that's nonsense,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.600
I don't really care about that

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.760
and just let him do his thing.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.640
And when I see this play out in front of me,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.240
I'm often reminded of the prisoner's dilemma because

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.240
that person is in a similar situation right?

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.000
Whatever I do, whether my project is a success or not,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.360
whether we manage to reduce inequality or not,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.640
this guy has to decide whether to devote

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.520
some of his time, some of his resources,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.400
some of his energy

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.120
towards reducing inequality

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.760
and the truth of the matter is,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.160
you as an individual,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.360
every individual in this country,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.440
whether they choose to support this or not,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.400
probably won't make a difference

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.560
to whether we're successful or not.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.440
So that person basically has the choice of

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.440
supporting and

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.280
making some sort of

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.520
guaranteed loss of time

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.520
or just ignoring and using his time in a selfish way.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.840
And whatever choice he makes, he will probably

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.120
well, society will probably end up

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.480
in the same situation.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.440
We will either succeed

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.400
and the economy will get better or we will fail

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.440
and the economy will get worse.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.920
So once again,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.560
we're in this kind of interesting situation

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.040
where basically,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.880
if enough people are willing to act unselfishly,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.000
which means

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.800
devoting a little bit of time, a little bit of energy

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.120
towards

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.520
watching our videos, understanding what's happening,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.560
sharing the videos, telling your friends and family,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.680
trying to build the big movement

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.920
so that a majority of this country understands

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.040
if we don't fix inequality, the economy will get worse.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.040
If enough people do that, then

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.920
we can solve this problem.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.680
If not enough people do that, then

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.720
you will continue to see what we are seeing,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.720
which is living conditions

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.520
continue to fall relatively quickly.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.960
There’s big increases in poverty,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.080
life gets worse and worse for ordinary people

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.280
in this country.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.480
And I think it's an interesting kind of...

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.520
essentially it's a prisoner's dilemma

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.960
for not just two players, but the country as a whole.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.880
Every individual person in this country

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.040
can be a little bit better off

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.040
just not bothering about it

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.880
basically, just just do what you

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.160
can for yourself, for your family

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.520
just only worry about you

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.880
and the people closest to you.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.360
And if enough people make that decision,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.480
the economy will collapse and ordinary families

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.600
will be poor,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.320
or people make that sacrifice,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:04.920
a guaranteed

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.000
sacrifice of their time and their energy and people...

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.800
and protect the ordinary people of the country,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.440
avoid the collapse of the economy.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.560
And I think it's

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.760
a really interesting kind of

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.640
philosophical dilemma, right. Because,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.280
you know, I grew up in this country

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.360
and I grew up in a culture

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.040
which was very much sort of get rich or die trying.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.480
And, you know,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.000
I believe it’s important to look after your family.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.480
And I understand the desire to try and be selfish

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.040
and to try and get rich.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.160
But it's created this really interesting situation

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.280
where if ordinary people

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.920
can be convinced in large enough number to be greedy,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.640
then we know with certainty ordinary

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.200
people's kids and grandkids will be poor.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.960
It's interesting, right,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.640
because you would think

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.120
being greedy would make you rich.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.200
But we've created this game where

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.800
if we can convince enough people,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.640
poor people and ordinary people to be greedy enough,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.960
then we can absolutely bankrupt the kids of

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.360
poor and ordinary people.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.640
So in a sense, it's kind of a

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.920
it's kind of a test, really.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.440
It's a test for the people of this country, basically.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.320
Are enough people willing

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.960
to make that sacrifice of time and effort

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.840
to educate themselves, to educate each other,

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.360
that the only way we can reduce inequality is together?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.800
Or basically, are we too selfish to do that?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.360
And are we going to drive ourselves into poverty?

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.040
So listen,

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.040
game theory teaches us not that people are selfish,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.240
but that if enough people are selfish,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.160
basically we can completely f*ck them over.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.880
And I think this is kind of the situation that

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.240
we are in as a country.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.960
I think the culture of

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.920
our country has sort of moved

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.520
in a direction in the last 40, 50 years

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.200
where people have been trained to be selfish

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.520
and the big problem with this is

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.480
if everyone is selfish and everybody fights selfishly,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.920
then it becomes easy for the very powerful

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.440
and the very rich to take everything

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.080
from the ordinary and from the weak.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.040
And that is what is happening,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.480
essentially, I believe in the economy,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.480
and that is why life is getting worse.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.960
And the only power that ordinary people

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.920
have to protect themselves

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.440
and the rich and the powerful is

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.200
that there's a lot of them

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.440
and they only use that power

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.800
if they act unselfishly and work together.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.960
So, listen, I believe we can fix the economy.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.280
We can only do it by dealing

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.760
realistically with inequality.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.120
The rich are not going to support that

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.320
and they're going to oppose it. And they do oppose it.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.560
But we can stop that by working together.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.720
I'm going to do that. I'm going to keep working on it.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.080
That's why we put these videos out every week.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.520
And I hope you do too.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.960
So please

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.840
watch these videos, share these videos and

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.960
help us bring people together

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.000
and fix this economy by understanding it better.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.520
Thank you.
