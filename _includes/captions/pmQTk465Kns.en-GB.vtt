00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay guys welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.080
Today

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.240
we are going to do a final channel

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.120
update before I go on holiday.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.200
Okay I'm talking to you today on the 25th of June.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.160
We won't put this video out until much later.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.720
In the middle of the start

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.360
of a beautiful London heatwave.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.560
I am about to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.680
fly off to Japan in a few days to finally do

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.400
this long cycle I've wanted to do for ages.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.080
so I thought it'd be a nice time

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.120
to just look back a little bit on what has been

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080
a mad year for me and for the channel

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
and for the world and talk a little bit

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.920
about what we've achieved

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.640
and what we're going to do in the future.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.440
So the first thing to say is,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560
of course, that this year has been basically

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.400
just a massive, massive year for growth on the channel.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280
At the moment I'm shooting this, we are

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.320
about 275,000 subs on YouTube.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040
A year ago that was something like 80,000.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.280
We've had massive growth on Instagram, on TikTok.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.240
We've started to really cut through

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.320
quite a lot, basically.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.280
And that's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000
thanks to a lot of your support sharing the videos.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.240
Thanks to a lot of hard work

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
from the team that we've put together.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.720
And yes, something to be proud of,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.080
in terms of how we're affecting

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.000
the conversation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.920
You know, my aim

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.360
with this

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.000
channel has always been basically

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.760
to build the bridge between

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.960
inequality and the economy.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.360
I think that

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.640
almost everybody agrees

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.800
that high levels of inequality are a bad thing,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.080
but I think people have

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.840
believed or been kind of fooled

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.040
into believing for a long time that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.120
high levels of inequality

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.600
are kind of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.320
a necessary sacrifice,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.000
kind of the price you pay for a good economy

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.840
in a capitalist society.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.600
But those of you who know my history will know

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.120
I made a lot of money basically

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560
betting that high inequality

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280
will destroy the economy in the long term.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.720
And what I really want to do

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960
is get people to see

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.800
the things that are happening

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.440
in the real economy, in their real lives.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.880
Increased difficulty with

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.800
buying houses,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.440
in many cases, just paying the rent, buying food

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.240
and connect them

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.800
with the really rapidly

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.240
growing inequality we're seeing in society.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400
I think that if we can get people

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.200
to recognise that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.480
the reason that they or their kids

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.960
or their grandkids are struggling

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.240
economically is because of growing inequality,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.440
and that problem will get worse and worse,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.000
that we can start to take action on it. And,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.760
we definitely have been making progress on that.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.520
This year, I brought in for the first time

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.640
a couple of professionals.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.880
Professional videographer,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.600
professional channel manager

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.240
to help me manage the growth of the channel

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.160
during the book release. And,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.000
in order to do that,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720
we went and got some funding from like a big

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.480
charitable foundation here in London.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.680
They do a lot of work on inequality.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.640
That's why they funded us.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.680
And, they've been sort of surveying people,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.520
and they've found there's been a massive increase in

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.560
people who think that the reason

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.880
the economy is bad is because of

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.960
growing inequality, basically. And,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.320
you know, when I heard that,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.160
I was really proud because that's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.360
partly, I think because of this channel.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.000
And I think that's partly

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.760
because of the work that we do here.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.160
So we're getting out there, we're reaching people,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.320
we're still not reaching enough people.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.320
I think still, most people in the country don't realise

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.400
growing inequality is the reason for growing poverty,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.040
for growing difficulties in their lives.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160
But we are making progress.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.040
I watch a lot of news in the morning

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.120
because I want to see what people are being told,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200
and I watch the most basic commonplace news in the UK.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.800
I watch BBC news and Sky news.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.080
And I was watching

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.280
BBC radio five live

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.320
while I was eating breakfast the other day and,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.440
they were interviewing a Green candidate.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.360
We mentioned on another video

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.640
that the Greens have basically adopted

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.000
our policies of a wealth tax.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.960
And I was watching the interviews and

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.560
nobody was talking about wealth inequality,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.960
and it was kind of making me think like,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.000
what more do we have to do to really get this issue

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.400
really into the discussion

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.720
so that mainstream politicians have to talk about it.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.240
So it has to be mentioned.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.440
And exactly when I,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.000
was thinking

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.280
that I was eating my porridge, there was a caller,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.040
a lady called Helen from Burnley called in and,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.920
she basically said, you know,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.680
are you guys aware of how much money

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.320
has being given out

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.000
during Covid, the government deficit,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.800
since Covid is £700 billion

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.880
and are you aware of where that money's ended up?

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880
Whether it's ended up with the richest people,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.560
whether it's increased inequality?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.520
Because what I'm seeing is

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.720
a massive increase in the wealth

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.240
of billionaires and millionaires.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.560
And, I don't think people are talking about it.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.720
People aren’t doing anything about it. And,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.200
it was immediately obvious

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.720
because nobody else really talks about these issues

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.720
and because of the language

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.080
she was using that she got that information

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.560
from this channel. And,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.880
you know, I know that's a one off instance,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.160
but it was quite emotional for me to see that we’re

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.440
starting to cut through, we’re stating

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.040
to affect the conversation.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.440
And I think that's,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.760
that's something we can all be proud of.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.760
It's part of the conversation now.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.960
But at the same time, realistically,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.240
it's not a central enough part.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.560
I think we're starting to make cuts

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.640
throughs with people on the street,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.640
but we're seeing a lot of other problems coming in.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.240
The rhetoric that the problems are primarily

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.360
caused by immigration

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.400
is growing and growing and growing.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.040
Partly because of the, you know, the resurgence

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.680
in the return of Nigel Farage.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.160
His voice is way, way, way louder than mine.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.320
And,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.680
because this inequality problem is not being fixed, it

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.840
inevitable that the economic problems

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.560
and the living standards

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.640
problems will keep getting worse

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.760
and people will become very dissatisfied

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.200
with the incoming Labour government.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.600
They'll become very dissatisfied with the status quo.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.920
They’ll want change,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.360
and they'll be looking for an alternative. And,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.440
at this point in time,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.800
when you look at the loudness of ‘the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.120
problem is immigration’ versus

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.400
the loudness of ‘the problem is inequality’,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.120
it's really hard to see them not winning.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.840
And, I want to be really clear when I say this.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.400
You know, I'm not saying that immigration doesn't

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.720
cause economic problems for certain groups of people,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.360
you know. In fact, I think it probably does.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360
I think the problem you have here

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.480
is that it is going to drown out this narrative.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.320
And if we don't win this narrative, then

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.280
the economy will continue to collapse, basically.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.240
That's the problem on one side.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.960
On the other side,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.920
we have an incoming Labour government,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.640
who are advised by a group of mainstream economists

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.520
and journalists

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.520
who are super, super resistant to taxation.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.200
There was a tweet by a guy, what was his name?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.480
Dan Neidle recently, which said,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.440
if taxing wealth is so easy, why doesn't anybody do it?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.280
And he showed that, you know, across the world,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.560
wealth taxation is quite low.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.080
And, I thought that was quite funny because, you know,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.920
what we have at the moment is a situation

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.320
where basically across the Western world,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.240
living standards are falling.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.920
And it's pretty clear that what is being done

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.160
across the Western world is

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.600
a kind of a unanimous shared economic opinion

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.000
being driven by these

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.120
relatively well-paid economists.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.600
And it's not working. It's not working.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.920
And we need to do something different.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.000
But unfortunately, I think what we have

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.600
is a lot of relatively well-paid

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.200
economists and academics and politicians

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.560
who have decent salaries

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.520
and decent houses and mortgages to pay

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.840
that just don't want to pay any more tax, basically.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.360
And even though I'm quite explicit,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.440
I'm not trying to tax them, I'm

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.120
trying to tax the very rich.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.120
I think they're just very instinctively conservative,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.280
very instinctively protective.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.560
I continue to believe that

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.800
we're not going to get change

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.720
delivered to us from well-paid people,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.520
from the richest people in society.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.120
You know, I would like this sort of...

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.520
this well-paid middle class

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.560
who are not the sort of asset, super rich

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400
to support us,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.440
because I would like them to realise that

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.200
if things keep going

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.880
the way they're going, living standards will collapse.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.440
And we'll keep

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.360
campaigning them,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.560
we'll keep lobbying the Labour Party,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.280
we’ll keep trying to build support.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.240
But I really don't think we'll win

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.320
unless we have ordinary people demanding it.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320
So I'm going to keep doing it.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.440
And, we're going to keep pushing it

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.560
and hopefully we’ll make it.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.280
But for the moment, I'm going on holiday.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.200
For me personally, it's been an absolutely crazy year.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200
I wrote a whole book, which, came out in March,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.480
The Trading Game.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.040
I've talked about it a lot on the channel.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.960
It was a Sunday Times

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.280
number one best seller for two weeks.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.320
It was in the top ten for eight or nine weeks.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.640
I had press

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.800
all over the world, loads of press in this country.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.680
It's blown up

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680
this channel massively.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.040
I've been getting recognised in the street

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.000
a lot, in the gym, in Lidl, all over the place.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.640
And that's great.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.480
It was always part of the plan

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.960
to, sort of, use my face and use my name.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.840
But it's been a lot, basically. It's been a lot.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.440
I think people who only watch the videos

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.440
probably don't realise that I'm also

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.560
doing a ton of interviews

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.240
for all different press all over the world,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.520
and speaking to people

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.360
about how we can sort of grow this movement,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.920
and also like

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.280
thinking all the time about

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.720
what are the ways that we can communicate

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.720
to push this message out there.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.720
And, you know, you write a book,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.680
I was published by Penguin, you know,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.040
you get a massive amount of support,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.520
like I had basically a full time

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.920
publicist working with me.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.800
She was amazing.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.640
She has to be like,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.440
take a lot of the credit for

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.720
the growth of this channel.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.520
But at the end of the day, she's trying to sell books.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.200
She's not trying to push a political message,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.160
you know, and,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.920
I obviously say,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.080
you know,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.360
I want to try to push this

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.520
political message,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.280
but I'm always thinking,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.080
how can we use this publicity and to help grow

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.840
these ideas?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.400
And, it's a lot of work.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.080
It’s been a lot of work creatively.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.480
I'm always thinking about new ways

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.240
we can push things creatively. And,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.120
it's just been hard basically, it's exhausting.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.600
I'm not the kind of person who

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.160
loves being recognised in the street.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.880
I don't want to tell people

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.960
not to say hi to me in the street

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.320
because everyone's really, really nice

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.400
and I really appreciate everybody's support.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.840
But it's just weird. It's just I'm no used to it.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.000
I'll get recognised like seven, eight times a day now,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.320
and it's just a bit scary.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.200
And, you know, like,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.960
weird things happen,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.320
like Mail on Sunday did a massive, like,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.280
two page hit piece on me.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.600
I've got friends from Citibank forwarding

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.760
mails from, like,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.560
FT reporters asking if there's any dirt,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.720
any dirt on Gary Stevenson

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.000
which is stressful and stuff.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.120
You have to sort of,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.920
it’s new for me, stuff you have to deal with.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.400
But really more than anything,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.880
it's just stressful sort of seeing...

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.040
Seeing how difficult it's

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.200
going to be to win this fight.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.680
I think we've got a long way to go

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.800
before we get accepted by these sort of

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.960
well-paid, fancy posh

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.960
economists who don't like the idea of more taxes.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.600
We've had the big boost from the book now.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.520
I need to think about

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.960
how can we keep growing it, as well as

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.240
how can we keep making content?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.360
And, yeah,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.400
basically the last month or two,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.320
I've been pretty exhausted, and,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.960
I've decided to take a bit of time off.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.400
Go back to Japan, where I lived for two years,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.360
do this big cycle I want to do.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.440
Just basically tear away

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.040
and try and sort of refresh myself creatively,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.680
which means that we're pre-recording loads.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.640
I don't think this will go out

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.920
until maybe the end of July, maybe even into August,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.360
but we're trying to pre-record loads

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.440
so that we don't leave a big gap.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.880
But we might end up doing a gap.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.520
Depends sort of what I need personally.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.480
But I've been thinking about what we're going to do

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.760
when we come back.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.440
How we are going to manage the channel.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.120
This year we managed to get, as I've said,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.000
a little bit of external funding on the channel,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.960
and that's basically paid

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.600
the wages of my videographer,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.320
my manager, and we’ve got another guy doing subtitling.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.480
We had somebody help us

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.320
with just the branding of the channel a little bit.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.480
But it's tricky,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.080
external funding is tricky because we had,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.240
obviously we had the election called early,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.560
and they didn’t want me to do any political videos.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.920
So, I basically just funded some videos myself.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.720
And also the funding will run out at some point

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.600
and we sort of have to decide what to do.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.160
At the moment,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.600
the channel is making just kind of roughly enough

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.400
from YouTube revenue

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.040
to pay for the staff that we've got.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.520
But I think going forward,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.440
if it's going to be really a thing,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.840
I'm probably going to need more support,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.200
a bit more creative support,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.920
a bit more help

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.280
by structuring the videos,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.000
managing the videos, managing the YouTube.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.160
I look at

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160
how much we’ve grown

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.800
because we’ve had a publicist from Penguin,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.880
and I do think if we had some real

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.160
PR support on the channel, it could be really bigger.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.840
So,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.120
I've been thinking for a while about whether we should

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.800
basically open up for donations

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800
so that we can hire more staff, and,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.160
I think I'm going to do that.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.080
So what I'm planning at the moment is to

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.480
start a not for profit company

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.880
so that anyone who donates, can know

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.080
for sure that the money is not going to me

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.960
and basically open a Patreon,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.560
see if we get some money in,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.760
and then maybe just build up a little pot of cash

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.280
so that I can get the support that I need.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.960
I know that with people that say, well,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.760
you're a millionaire, Gary you should fund it, but,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.560
I'm a millionaire that spends most of my time

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.960
working for free on a YouTube channel.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.080
So, I don't really

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.520
want to start funding it myself as well,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.160
because, I'm already working for free.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.800
I've worked on it for free for a long time, and,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.520
I don’t think it’s going to work basically,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.880
if we're going to have to make it as big as we need,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.680
we're going to need staff.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.880
And I think if we're going to really, really grow,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.960
we're going to need more people. And,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.880
I'm not going to be able to keep funding it myself.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.640
I have funded up till now.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.320
But if it's going to go,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.120
we're going to need a bit more money.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.320
So I think I'm going to open a Patreon.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.520
I'm not going to say to anybody, you need to donate.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.120
You need to donate.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.920
I'm going to open it,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.640
see what we get,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.880
and if we get enough money,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.520
we can hopefully use that to make a few more videos,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.320
mix up a little bit the creative output,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.600
make some longer videos,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.920
get some stuff with animations in.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.440
But yeah, I think that's what we're going to have to do

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
because it's just basically

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.000
getting too big for me to manage it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.080
I want to be able to like, totally split

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.160
the finances off.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.280
Really what I want to get is the finances separate.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.800
So I can just focus on the creative side

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.400
and not have to worry about having to fund it as well.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.760
So we'll do that.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.480
I'll try and get that sorted,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.120
hopefully before I’m back.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.560
But first and foremost,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.120
I'm going to take a little break, go and chill out.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.120
Try and come back with some good,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.880
creative stuff because,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.360
one video

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.360
a week on top of all of these mental interviews

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.000
is quite a lot.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.640
And sometimes I feel a little bit creatively burnt out.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.080
But yeah, I'm not going to stop.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.200
I think the way that this channel

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.720
is going to go,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720
I'm probably always going to have to

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.240
take bits of time out to just escape the pressure

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.760
and the constant creative churn,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.400
because it's hard to do something

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.960
good, new, creative once a week.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.920
But, I'll keep doing it.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.440
I'll keep doing that at a pace that works for me.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.640
We'll open for funding, but we won't paywall

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.280
any of the content.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.040
We'll just see what we get

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.280
and whether that means we can grow

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.120
more quickly and get

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.040
get more staff and get more support.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.400
If you do choose to donate,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.560
we'll really appreciate that.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.680
But for now,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.200
thank you very much for all of your support,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.560
whether that's in the last 2 or 3 months,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.120
whether that's in the last 3 or 4 years.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.280
Thanks for your supporting on the channel.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.880
I really, truly believe if we don't manage

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.480
to get some action on this rapidly

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.280
growing inequality, that it will have

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.400
a devastating impact on ordinary people.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.240
But I think we can. I think we can do it.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.600
I think if you see the growth of this channel

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.480
this year, it shows that demand is there.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.800
I'll do my best to try to get the strategy right.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.960
If we get a bit of funding,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.720
then I'll try and get some experts in who are not

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.200
economists trying to run a YouTube channel on the side.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.800
But we'll keep growing.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.000
We're going to get opportunities here and

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.400
people are supporting it,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.120
and, I'll keep fighting for it

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.640
if you keep fighting for it,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.360
but maybe not for the next couple of months.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.560
Have a good summer. And,

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.480
good luck.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.520
Thank you.
