00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.480
Okay. Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.200
Today we are going to talk about

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.280
giving your money to the government.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.320
All right.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.120
So I wanted to do a quick one addressing

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.560
one of the most common questions, criticisms

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.680
we get on the channel,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.800
which is why do you want to increase taxes?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.040
All of that money is going to go to government.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.120
Government is full of corrupt idiots.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.280
They're going to steal my money.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.960
They're going to waste my money. It's a waste of time.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.040
Don't do it. Gary, you're a communist.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.640
And

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.280
I thought this was an interesting one to talk about.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.000
Because there's a kind of a perception

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.040
when I say that I want to tax

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.760
the rich more, that I must

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.680
necessarily be wanting

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.200
to give more money to the government.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.280
I must be wanting to increase the size of government.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.040
And I think this is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.480
a good chance basically to show that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760
this is not what I'm trying to do.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
So when I talk about taxing the rich,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.440
first thing to say is I'm talking

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.560
about taxing the very rich.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.120
This is not about taxing,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.480
very likely, not about taxing you, not about your kids.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.800
It's not about taxing lawyers

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.920
or even bankers or people

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920
who are making sort of 100, 200 grand a year.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.120
We're talking about taxing

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.240
extremely wealthy individuals

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.000
with wealth of more than £10 million.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.640
And what we want to do is to tax them

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.240
so that we can lower your taxes.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240
This is not really by increasing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.360
the size of government at all.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.240
What I see is a situation

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.480
where ordinary families

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.680
are increasingly losing their wealth,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.200
and that wealth is flowing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
to the very, very rich.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.560
And I'm trying to see

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.640
how is it that we can, number one,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.760
protect your family from losing its wealth?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.400
And number two, help your family get its wealth back?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.680
And I think this is,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.560
it's an interesting thing to talk about,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.480
because what is happening

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.640
here is quite counterintuitive.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.560
And when I say

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.360
we want to tax

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.840
the rich, people think immediately more taxation means,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.720
more taxation for me,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.680
less money for me, less money

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.520
and wealth for me and my family.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.640
And instead that money and wealth

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.800
go into the government.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.000
And people think that Gary's a big government guy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.680
Gary is a communist.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.000
But really what this is about

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.520
is, is about getting your wealth back.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.240
And I think that's quite a,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.640
it's an interesting concept, right,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400
that we can increase tax

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.640
and then increasing in tax,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.600
we can get your wealth back.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.200
So I wanted to just go through

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200
the basic

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.120
logic of how

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.280
it can be

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.960
that increasing tax can make you richer,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.200
because that is ultimately what I'm trying to do here.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
Assuming that you are not a super rich person

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.440
and you are from an ordinary family.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360
I want to increase tax to make you richer

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.800
and your family, you as an individual.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.160
So how does this work?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.080
The first

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720
and most obvious way is,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.640
if we increase taxation on the super rich,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000
we can reduce your taxes.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.520
So at the moment we have a tax system

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.600
which taxes working people at a very high rate.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.800
You know, I worked

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.880
and I made quite a lot of money

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.280
and I was paying more than 50% tax at the time.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
But it taxes, extremely wealthy families,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.920
extremely wealthy individuals at a rate

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400
often close to 0%.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.600
These guys have an enormous amount of wealth.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.000
They generate enormous amount of income

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.920
from that wealth.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.880
They don't pay tax.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.640
If we tax them much more, we can reduce your taxes.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
This means more money in your pocket.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.120
This means more money going to you.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.760
Now, I'm not instinctively a big government person,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.520
but we do exist at the moment in this country,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.680
the UK, at the end of 50 years of austerity,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.160
which has really starved

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.400
a lot of government services of money,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.640
especially if you look at things like

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.560
local government services,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.720
even things like the police, education,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.120
massively starved of money,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.800
things like

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.680
the legal system,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.960
the court system, anyone who works

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.840
anywhere, especially in local services,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.480
will see massive starvation of money.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.400
So I think at this point

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.680
you probably would want to use some of that money

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.480
to help fund local services, which are being...

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.840
have been decimated the last 15, 20 years.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.600
What this means is

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.440
less money for the rich, more money for you

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.120
because your taxes are reduced,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.560
more money for local services,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
so you won't have to pay for things

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.680
which you're currently paying for,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.080
because that would be provided by the government.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.120
You have more money in your pocket.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.280
Local workers around

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.320
you will have more money in their pocket

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.440
because

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.120
government are trying to hire staff,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.080
trying to improve the public services

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.360
which have been decimated for a long time.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.440
It means you’ll have more money.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.720
People around you will have more money.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160
You will be able to spend that money.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.640
People around

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.600
you will be able to spend that money,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.280
which means your wages will go up.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.680
So we say, number one, your wages go up.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.480
Number two, your taxes go down.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.000
And that means more wealth in your pocket.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920
Now there is another channel

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.920
by which increasing taxation on the rich

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.840
will make you richer.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.920
I think this is also quite

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.120
interesting and counterintuitive,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.240
which is if you increase tax

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.120
on the very rich people with wealths of £10 million,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.720
£100 million, a billion massively,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
you will enforce rich people selling their assets.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.880
If you tax them really, really highly

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.800
and to be honest, I think at this point

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.160
wealth inequality has become so

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.240
large and is growing so quickly.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.600
You really do need to tax

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.680
these people really massively.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.120
If you where to tax them a lot,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.920
you could put them in a situation

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.560
where they have to sell their assets.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.520
And I think a lot of people

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.440
see this instinctively as a bad thing.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.040
It's often an argument that is made.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.240
You shouldn't tax the rich a lot

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.520
because maybe they're not that cash rich.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.720
Maybe they're just holding lots of assets.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.640
And if you tax them a lot

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.520
they’ll have to sell their assets.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.800
Increasingly, as wealth inequality grows

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.560
a bigger and bigger share of the national wealth

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.160
of national assets are owned by the very rich.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.880
Now, if you are very rich, say

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.720
you have a wealth of £100 million or let's say

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.640
£500 million, like Rishi Sunak,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.640
according to the Sunday Times,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.240
you would generate a passive income of £25 million

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.680
a year,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.800
£2 million a month.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.760
If the wealth is being held

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.480
by people who have a passive income of £2 million

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.080
per month,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.480
they will never sell anything.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.440
If you had a large amount of wealth,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.600
you're making £2 million a month.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.280
Why would you ever sell any of your assets?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.560
You're making £2 million a month.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.120
You never need to sell anything.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.160
So increasingly,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.240
we are in a situation where the assets are owned

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.480
by people who never have to sell any assets.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.720
If that is the situation,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.040
obviously, working people like you,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040
like your kids, like a parent

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.000
will never be able to afford assets.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.360
If you want working people

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.160
to be able to afford assets like housing,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.760
it is essential that the current owners of assets

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.920
at some point sell their assets.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.280
If you give all the assets

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.720
to people

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.240
that never sell assets,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.760
it will be impossible

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.240
for working people without assets to buy assets.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.160
This is how things work.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.360
It's impossible to buy a thing if nobody said a thing.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.960
It is vital in order to get things

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.000
like housing back

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.400
into the hands of ordinary working families,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.720
that the owners of assets sell their assets.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.680
At the moment,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.000
the superrich have enormous passive incomes,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.280
they never sell anything.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.360
We need them to sell their assets.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.760
So for me,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.320
taxing the super rich is not about growing government.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.120
It's definitely not about moving us

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.920
to a communist state.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.800
Taxing the rich is about rebalancing

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.600
essentially power and ownership in our society.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.880
At the moment,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.600
both government

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.040
and the middle class are losing

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.120
their wealth rapidly to the rich.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.560
The only way to get that back is through taxation.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.320
If we tax them more, we can tax you less.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.560
You'll have more money.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.200
The rich will be selling assets.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.080
That means you and your kids can have assets.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.560
You can own things. You can be rich.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.640
We're not going to get assets

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.360
into the hands of ordinary working people

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.400
unless we take them out of the hands

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.120
of the people who own everything.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.760
And the only way to do that is through taxation.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.360
So for me,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.960
taxation is about growing the assets

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960
and the wealth of ordinary working people.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.200
And I would like to sort of

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.400
get you to see taxation in a new light.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.040
Taxation has been given a terrible brand,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.160
largely by rich people,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.360
because they don't want to pay it.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.400
Taxation is how you define yourself.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.080
Taxation is how you get wealth back from the group

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.960
that is taking your wealth.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.880
And I kind of want increasingly, for you

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.240
to see taxation as kind of a tool you can use

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.000
in essentially a war.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.840
Now, when you have a war,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.280
when you have an invading army,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.760
why do people invade countries?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.480
Why do people start wars?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.200
Because they want to take the assets.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.400
And what is happening in your country?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.880
Assets that used to be owned by the middle class,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.320
that used to be owned

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.440
by the government

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.480
are, over time, being owned by the rich

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.520
and the super rich.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.400
That is what war is. War is about taking assets.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.680
Your assets will not be owned by your kids

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.360
or grandkids.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.560
They'll be owned by the kids

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.320
and the grandkids of the superrich.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.880
They are an invading army.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.960
The only tool you have to defend yourself is taxation.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.240
So if you tax the rich,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.680
we can get money in your pocket.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.000
We can get assets, to your kids and your grandkids.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.640
If you don't tax

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.120
the rich, inequality will grow more and more

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.960
and your grandkids will be poor.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.160
So taxation for the rich is about reducing your taxes.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.720
It's not about growing the state.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.320
It's about protecting your kids from poverty.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.200
The government not going to do it.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.320
They're full of extremely wealthy people.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.600
You have to fight back.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.040
You have to use the only tool that you have,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.120
which is taxation.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.240
It's the only way to protect yourself from the rich.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.600
We're going to keep campaigning for it.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.480
Please share the videos. Help us grow this message.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480
Thank you.
