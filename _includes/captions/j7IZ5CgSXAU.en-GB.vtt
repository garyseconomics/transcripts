00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.760
Today we are going to talk about

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.680
Rishi Sunak’s taxes and how the rich live.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.320
Okay.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.280
So I wanted to do a video on

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.920
a story that came out a couple of months ago

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.360
about Rishi Sunak’s tax return,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.560
because I think that the way

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.680
it was reported in the media was,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.160
it totally didn’t tell us the true story.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.240
Focused completely on the wrong thing

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.960
and I think we can learn a lot

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
about how the rich live,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.200
what rich people's lives are like,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.320
and what real wealth is like by looking at this story.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160
So this story, some of you might have seen it.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
It came out in the beginning of February,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.040
and it was about Rishi Sunak releasing his tax return.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.880
And all of the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.640
newspaper reports focused exactly on the numbers

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.960
and the percentage rate of tax that Rishi Sunak paid.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.720
So I've got the story here.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.880
I'm looking at the BBC version of the story

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.840
and it says here Rishi

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.960
Sunak paid UK tax of £508,308 on an income of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.480
just over £2.2 million,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120
which means he paid a tax rate of something

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.040
like 23% or something like that.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.360
And the story, basically

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.720
everyone ran the same version of the story,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.760
which was Rishi

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.120
Sunak is paying 23% tax

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.360
and ordinary high earners are paying 40

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.760
or maybe 50% tax, once you include national insurance.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.880
And as soon as I saw this story,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.320
the thing that jumped out at me was not

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.480
Rishi Sunak's rate of tax that he paid.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.800
That is not unusual.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.000
In fact, most

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
very wealthy people pay

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.040
a lot lower rates of tax than that.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.680
The thing that jumped out at me was one number

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.600
was obviously immediately wrong in this story,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.480
and nobody mentioned it.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.040
So I've spoken a lot about Rishi Sunak’s net worth

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.200
on this channel,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.120
Sunday Times rich list had Rishi Sunak's net worth

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.680
something like £730 million.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.520
The most recent one,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.360
I think that it came down to £550, £560 million,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960
something like that.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.840
Now imagine let's take a conservative estimate

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.000
that the real number is £500 million.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.440
In reality, it's probably higher

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.240
because rich people often hide their wealth.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.960
But let's take a conservative estimate £500 million.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.200
Imagine you’re Rishi Sunak. £500 million.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
What is going to be your net passive income?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.040
Your passive income you’re getting from £500 million.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.360
But at the moment Bank of England

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600
base rate is about 5%.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.200
You could get 5% interest rates on a savings account.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.160
So if Rishi Sunak was to take his £500 million

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.240
and put it into a savings account,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.120
he would be making £25 million

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.440
a year passive income.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.640
He's not including his payment

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.720
he gets for being prime minister, anything like that.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.360
£25 million a year passive income.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120
How can it be

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240
that a man who makes £25 million

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.200
a year passive income,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960
only makes £2 million a year?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.120
It just it doesn't make any sense to me.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.680
And as soon as I saw that number,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.000
as soon as I saw that article,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.960
I really wasn't interested in the tax rate he paid.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.680
I was interested in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.240
how can it be that his reported income is so much less

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.720
than what he's really income is?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.160
So I can basically tell you now

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.560
the reason why his reported income is so low.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.920
Number one is because very wealthy

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.960
people like Rishi Sunak,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.520
most of their wealth is in assets,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.000
and in many cases, most of their income

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.200
from wealth comes in the form of capital gains,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.120
which is the price of their assets going up.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.320
And capital gains only get taxed

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.080
when you sell the asset.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.160
If you don't sell the asset,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.640
then this is what's called unrealised capital gains.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.080
It doesn't get taxed in our system.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.960
So there's no tax payable.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.440
And basically

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.640
if you hold a load of assets

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.400
and the prices go up

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.920
and up and up, as long as you don't sell anything,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.520
then you don't have to put anything on your tax return

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.440
at all.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.320
So, you know, Rishi Sunak,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.320
the only reason that his income is even

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.560
£2 million is because he happened

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560
to sell

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.080
a lot of stock in the US investment fund that he had,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.560
which netted him a £1.8 million capital gain.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.440
If he didn’t sell that,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.440
then his income would only have been...

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.280
It says it here, £400,000.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.760
So the first thing is rich

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360
people can very, very effectively hide their income

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.680
by owning assets.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.120
That the price goes up

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.000
when they don't sell the assets.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.600
You know, even if we have to accept that Rishi

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.800
Sunak’s income is £2 million,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.720
he will never have to sell any assets.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.040
If you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.960
make £2 million a year,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.680
you don’t have to sell anything,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920
which means you don’t have to declare anything,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.880
which means you have to pay tax on anything.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.080
But the real reason, the main reason

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.560
why Rishi Sunak is able to declare such a low income

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.760
is because most of Rishi Sunak’s

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.400
family wealth is owned by Rishi Sunak’s

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.480
wife,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.840
and Rishi Sunak's wife

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.240
who has had many articles written about her

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.240
in many cases doesn't pay any tax

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.520
because she was a non-dom,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.120
a lot of her income is overseas.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.240
She doesn't have to pay tax on it here.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.360
Okay. Let's explain the situation more clearly. Okay.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.400
So Rishi Sunak is on his own,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.480
a relatively wealthy man.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.440
It's difficult to know exactly how these Rishi Sunak’s

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.720
wife is enormously, unbelievably wealthy.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.960
She's worth half a billion pounds, maybe £1 billion.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.000
Rishi Sunak’s wife's father-in-law

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.880
is one of the richest men in the world.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.360
He's worth 3 to £4 billion, something like this.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.280
So Rishi Sunak is declaring £2 million income.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.440
Rishi Sunak's wife,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.520
we know is making something like 30 or £40 million

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240
passive income a year.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.920
Rishi Sunak's wife's

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.040
father, he's worth say, let's say £3 billion,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.720
if he's making 5%.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.240
Now these are conservative estimates and normally

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.800
very wealthy people make much more than 5%.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800
If he makes 5% on £3 billion

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.240
he’ll be making £150 million a year.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.760
So what you have here is a man, Rishi Sunak,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.600
saying that he makes £2 million a year

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.640
when his wife makes

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.360
£1 million a week

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.560
and his wife’s father makes 3 or £4 million a week.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.880
So what you have here

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.360
is a really good example of how

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560
rich people

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.640
live, essentially,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.920
which is the money is held in the family,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.440
they make enormous amounts of passive income.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.840
Their work income is basically irrelevant,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.200
but they only pay tax on their work income

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.240
and they only show you their work income.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.640
And I think this is...

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.560
It's a fascinating

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.520
example, really,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.040
of how effectively

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.080
the rich are able to hide their income.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.640
So imagine you’re Rishi Sunak,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.720
some people will say, listen, that's not his money,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.680
It's his wife's money.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.600
Imagine you’re Rishi Sunak and you're getting paid

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.040
something like £200,000 - £300,000

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.600
a year to be prime minister.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.320
Your wife makes £1 million a week,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.720
your father-in-law makes 3 or £4 million a week.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.800
What are your financial interests?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.960
You know, you get paid up

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.040
a couple hundred grand a year to be prime minister

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.760
and your wife make £1 million a week.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.400
Her dad makes £4 million a week.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.040
What are your financial interests?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.160
Are your financial interests

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.680
to take care of the country?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.280
Or are your financial interests

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.600
to do what your wife and your father-in-law say?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.360
I've never met Rishi Sunak.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.520
He could be a perfectly nice guy.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.440
He could be someone who doesn't care about money.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.520
He could be someone who doesn't care

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.360
about his financial interests.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.320
But people who don't care

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.520
about their financial interests don't normally

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.160
work for Goldman Sachs,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.960
then go do a business degree at Stanford

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.520
and then marry the daughter

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.920
of one of the richest men in the world.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.360
So I think what you see here

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.040
is how the rich live.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.080
They own everything,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.720
but they basically hide it in their taxes.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.240
They hide in their tax returns.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.400
I think probably the most

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.800
interesting thing about this article

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.480
is how the media completely bought it.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.360
When I saw this,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.080
the only interesting thing in this article

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.560
is that Rishi Sunak's income is wrong,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.920
£2.2 million, which is Rishi Sunak declared

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.320
income is nothing for Rishi Sunak’s family.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.480
It's meaningless for Rishi Sunak’s family.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.960
They make twice that

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.520
every single week in passive income.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.000
It's totally meaningless.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.960
And I think

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840
this makes me think of the first time

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.920
Rishi Sunak came to prominence,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.600
I was very interested because

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.680
I'm a student of history.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.760
I'm very interested in medieval history,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.320
and I'm also obviously very interested

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.400
in economics and politics.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.960
And anyone who's interested

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.960
in economics and politics will know

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.160
political parties are funded

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.560
in many cases by rich people.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.720
They have very rich funders, which means that

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.920
when they make their decisions,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.880
when they make their policies,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.080
they have to be very careful not to upset rich people

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.880
because they get a lot of their money

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.040
from rich people.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.760
they have to be very careful

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.080
not to upset the newspapers,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.400
which in many cases are owned

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.600
by extremely rich people,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.520
because they upset the newspapers,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.200
then the newspapers can turn the public against him,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.040
and they’ll lose elections.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.120
So what this means is for,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.920
you know, for a long period of time,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.520
wealthy people have influenced political parties

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.480
from behind closed doors.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.440
And this is a very

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.560
useful position for a rich person to be in,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.640
because you can basically dictate the policies,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.920
you can keep your own taxes low, for example,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.800
and you don't have to give up your anonymity.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.360
So these guys can live lives of luxury.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.040
They can kind of control the political system,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.520
and you don't even have to know who they are.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.440
So it's a great situation for them to be in.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.840
when Rishi Sunak came out and became chancellor

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.920
and latterly became prime minister,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920
it was interesting for me

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.400
because why would you want to be the prime minister

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.680
take a load of sh*t, lose a load of privacy

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.640
when the rich were already controlling policy anyway?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.680
Not only is it a load of work and a load of hassle

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.320
that Rishi Sunak doesn't need,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.120
it makes it

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.280
increasingly obvious to the general public

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.040
what was previously kind of hidden,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.160
which is that rich people control policy.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.480
And this kind of reminds me

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.360
of the thing that happened in history

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.760
back in the sort of 1200’s, 1300’s

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.080
when a lot of wealthy,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.120
when basically when banking

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.280
was invented in Europe, especially in Italy,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.360
a lot of very wealthy families were created

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.400
because they started to make a ton of money

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.120
from banking.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.120
You had families like the Medicis in Florence.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.480
We have the banking families of Genoa, in

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.240
Venice, these very wealthy banking families,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.960
they made a huge amount of money

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.360
and they became as rich as kings.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.240
And at that time, kings sort of ruined everything.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.320
But they weren't really respected

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.960
because they weren't from aristocratic families.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.640
So what did they do?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.160
They started to think, how can we use our money

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.920
to buy prestige, to buy respect and to buy power?

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760
And they started to do things like, well,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.280
what I'm going to do is

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.400
I'm going to give my banking empire to my first son,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.960
and I'm going to use my second son

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.680
and my third son, my daughters,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.480
to try and marry into power, basically.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.160
You know, I'm going to try and

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.680
marry my daughter to the King of France

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.440
to try and get her powerful.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.360
I'm going to try to get my son to be pope,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.160
this kind of thing.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.600
We're going to try to use our family

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.840
to build connections

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.400
and really, Rishi

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.040
Sunak came

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.120
in, what I saw was an extremely wealthy man thinking,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.560
well, I'm going to give my empire to my son.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.480
Maybe I can use my daughter

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.160
to effectively become prime minister of England.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
And if you consider Rishi Sunak,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.800
he's making

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.920
£200,000 a year from being prime minister

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.600
and he's making £3 million

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.640
a week from being part of one of the richest

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.960
families in the world,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.400
what are his financial interests

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.240
and who is he really working for?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.680
I think this is the big question

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.640
that needs to be asked here.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.760
But I think

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.800
the most interesting thing here is basically.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.120
Number one.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.480
The wealthy are hiding their wealth,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.240
Rishi Sunak is hiding their wealth.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.040
They're not paying enough taxes.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.720
But number two, they are trying to rebrand themselves

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.600
as a kind of aspirational kind of normal, because...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.400
So Rishi Sunak,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.160
all of his income,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.440
his all of his wealth

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.760
is tied up in stocks and shares

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.520
that he

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.080
can basically release as much income

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.600
as he wants by selling assets year by year.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.480
He's chosen this year

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.760
to release £2.2 million of income.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.520
When we know that that could have been £300,000,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.840
it could have been...

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.560
It could have been £50 million if he wanted.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.040
He's chosen to say my income is £2.2 million.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.240
I think that is actually

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.880
a tactical choice for Rishi Sunak,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.960
because when he says I make £2.2 million,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.000
what he says is, I make the kind of money

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.240
that a very successful banker makes, that

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.360
a very successful businessman

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.560
makes, that an ordinary family

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.320
aspires for their kids to make one day.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.760
And what he is doing there is he's saying,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.640
I, Rishi Sunak,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.120
who is part of one of the richest families

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.240
in the world that makes millions of pounds

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.960
every week in passive income, I’m

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.920
just like what you aspire your kids to do.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.040
And I think he's trying to basically draw

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.480
a connection

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.720
between the financial situation of the super rich,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.320
Rishi Sunak’s

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.760
family is definitely part of the super rich

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.440
and what ordinary people aspire to be.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.640
And,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.800
in reality very, very few people ever make £2 million.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.120
But it is the kind of money

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.440
that an ordinary family can aspire to make.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.760
You know,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.720
they're ordinary families

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.640
who have

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.840
seen the value of their housing

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.120
go up to something like £2 million,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.640
especially if you live in a big city like London.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.960
You know, I made £2 million

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960
in one year, despite

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.640
coming from a very poor background.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.200
So this kind of money is aspirational,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.280
the kind of money that Rishi Sunak’s family,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.600
is, is totally impossible to achieve.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.320
And what he's trying to do here

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.840
is rebrand the wealth of the super rich as the wealth,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.240
the aspirational wealth of the middle class.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.840
And he's trying to build the connection

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.960
between the super rich and

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.120
an aspirational middle class family.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.280
And the reason he’s trying to do

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.880
that is so that when people like me

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.400
say, look the problem is the rich,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.080
you need to tax

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.120
the rich,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.680
ordinary people like you

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.760
who are not super rich

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.760
but aspire to own property,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.920
aspire to financial security.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.160
Think I'm going to tax you

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.800
because you think that your financial situation

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.040
is similar to Rishi Sunak's, but it's not.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.400
So, to conclude.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.280
Rishi Sunak doesn't pay 25% taxes.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.040
He pays virtually 0% taxes

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.480
because Rishi Sunak’s family income is not £2 million

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.200
a year. It's hundreds of millions of pounds a year.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.040
Because they are billionaires.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.600
They want you to think they're normal.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.520
So that when I say tax the rich, you hear tax you.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.480
These guys get richer and richer every year.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.120
They use their hundreds of millions of pounds

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.080
of passive income to compete with you,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.640
to compete with your kids,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.120
for your assets, for your homes,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.760
for the things that you need.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.640
They get richer every year. You get poorer every year.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.680
If you don't tax them.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.920
You are refusing to defend yourself

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.280
from the people who are coming for your homes.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.520
You have to tax the rich.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
You have to tax people like Rishi Sunak.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.440
If you don't tax them, you kids will be poor.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.680
That's why I do what I do every week.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.600
Tell your friends, tell you mum.
