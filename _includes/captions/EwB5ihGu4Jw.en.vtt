00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:12.200
What is happening now in Economics, in the Media, in
Universities, in the Bank of England, in the Government

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.480
It is a disaster. It is it is a comedy.&nbsp;
It is a disgrace. it is unbelievable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.840
the childishly weak level of&nbsp;
understanding in these institutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.040
but it is destroying the economy of this country&nbsp;
and the lives of people in this country so people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.840
need to understand it so today we're going&nbsp;
to explain what is going wrong with economics

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.360
so in my 14 years of working full-time in&nbsp;
the economy i've never once seen a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.840
where the public discussion, the public discourse&nbsp;
coming from the media, from the bank of England,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.680
from the government, about the economy has been&nbsp;
as ridiculously stupid as it is right now okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.680
so we've got a situation where in the last two&nbsp;
years the government printed £450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.440
an unbelievably huge amount of money&nbsp;
and effectively transferred that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.960
to the richest if you don't understand&nbsp;
why watch the first video on this channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.560
they printed 450 billion gave it to the&nbsp;
richest and that caused very predictable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.920
consequences which is a big jump in inflation, &nbsp;
a crisis of inequality and cost of living crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.400
for ordinary people okay very very predictable&nbsp;
very understandable okay £450 billion is&nbsp;an&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
enormous amount of money from the government&nbsp;
to the richest who's talking about it no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.360
no one in media, no one in government, no one in &nbsp;
the bank of england no one in universities right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.720
in this video what i'm going to talk about&nbsp;
is we're going to explain the system of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.440
economics as its taught at universities and as&nbsp;
it's discussed so that people can understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.760
why is that all of our institutions that&nbsp;
should be explaining what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.960
have completely failed to understand what's&nbsp;
happening now okay all right so imagine you are a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.320
smart talented young economic student okay a&nbsp;
lot of people study economics nowadays because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760
it's a degree that gets a pretty good job right&nbsp;
you can get a decent job if you study economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.040
so you go to a good university you get a top class&nbsp;
degree in economics what you're going to do all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.240
right so you're 21 years old you've just done your&nbsp;
undergrad good school in economics if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.840
become a professor you're gonna have to stay&nbsp;
in academia for another seven eight ten years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.360
pay money every year to study you're going to get&nbsp;
yourself in 100-200 grand of debt and then after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.920
that you'll have to work your way up in academia&nbsp;
maybe six seven years down the line you'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.760
making 60-70 grand a year okay or you can go into&nbsp;
the city in one of these skyscrapers over here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.320
and in my case by 26 i was a multi-millionaire&nbsp;
so imagine you are a smart kid from a poor or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.800
ordinary background okay you live in the world we&nbsp;
live in where houses in london cost half a million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.880
seven hundred grand you're from a poor family&nbsp;
which one of these two options are you gonna take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.320
you know think about it okay so we live in a world&nbsp;
where if you're from a poor background you would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.160
be insane to try and get into academic economics&nbsp;
okay and what that means is we end up in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.240
situation where if you go into economics that sort&nbsp;
of phd level or advanced level there is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.080
nobody there from a poor background or if they&nbsp;
are there it's because they basically didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.040
get the grades that were good enough to get a&nbsp;
job in the city so we've created a situation now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.560
where there's almost nobody from an&nbsp;
ordinary background studying economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.960
and if you're really really good at economics&nbsp;
there's an enormous financial incentive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.720
for you to go work in the city right so i did that&nbsp;
i got a degree and i went to work in the city the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.040
statistics completely support this economics is&nbsp;
at least representative of social class of all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.880
subjects in the USA which is where all the biggest&nbsp;
universities are you're most likely to be from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.680
family where the parents have degrees or have phds&nbsp;
you're least likely to come from families where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.560
parents don't so it's very very non-representative&nbsp;
of social class but also what it does is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.040
creates two separate worlds of economics okay&nbsp;
so the best paid 10 000 economists in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.240
they are basically all traders every single one&nbsp;
of them right they all do what i was doing they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.560
work for a fund they work for a big bank they work&nbsp;
at one of these skyscrapers they sit in office and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.240
they make trades okay you will never hear them on&nbsp;
the news you will never ever hear them on the news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.800
okay and these guys get paid you know a million&nbsp;
pounds a year two million pounds a year to manage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.840
money but you will never hear them okay, so when&nbsp;
i was working at Citibank i was a very successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.480
trader i was getting paid a lot of money my&nbsp;
job was to bet on European interest rates okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.040
say you're a journalist and you call up Citibank&nbsp;
and you say look we want to know what's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.880
happen to the european economy what are your&nbsp;
predictions do you think they put it on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.280
phone to me they don't put on the phone to me&nbsp;
right they put you on the phone to somebody else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.120
who gets paid 50 grand a year you know 20 times&nbsp;
less than what i get paid and and that person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.960
will give you their opinion but you see what&nbsp;
i'm saying here we've created this system where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.480
there's a huge financial incentive for all the&nbsp;
best economists to work as traders and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.880
are legally not allowed in their contracts to talk&nbsp;
to the press that's the world that we live in right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.640
so we've created the world where we're selecting&nbsp;
all of the people who think we are the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.400
we're sending them to the skyscrapers and we're&nbsp;
saying you can't talk to the press you can't talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.520
to the government you can't talk to the public and&nbsp;
yet we're we're saying if you if you're willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.840
to work for 30-40 grand a year which no good&nbsp;
economist my poor background is ever going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.880
then you can work in the media right and i think&nbsp;
it's um it's really important to understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.320
we've done here right we've we've completely&nbsp;
separated out the guys we think we are the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.720
and we've taken them completely out of the debate&nbsp;
and i think what is quite interesting is you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.360
i was working in these skyscrapers i was making&nbsp;
a million pounds a year you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.800
and i could still go and work any of these&nbsp;
skyscrapers and make a million pounds a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.360
right but now i'm out here you know telling people&nbsp;
what's happening on YouTube for free and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.400
is Rishi Sunak calling me up no he's not you know&nbsp;
i went back to Oxford to do a masters right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.120
i was one of the most successful best paid&nbsp;
traders in the world for trading interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.840
and i went into a lecture for with a professor&nbsp;
whose job is to teach about interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.160
and i said to him why do you think you guys have&nbsp;
predicted interest rates incorrectly for 10 years&nbsp;in&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.960
a row and he said to me well "no we always knew&nbsp;
that rates would stay 0%" which is categorically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:47.280
completely verifiably wrong, right but he's able&nbsp;
to say that because in academia nobody ever goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.920
back and checks if your predictions are right&nbsp;
you see what i'm saying and then for me i was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.440
able to go into the city and you know come from a&nbsp;
poor background no connections don't know anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.680
and within a few years i was famous in the bank&nbsp;
because my predictions were consistently right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.240
and i think it's interesting to contrast the world&nbsp;
of finance where people you work in a bank right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.200
you get a thousand emails a day you want to&nbsp;
talk to a world economic expert anything you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.760
can call them up and they'll talk to you know&nbsp;
what i mean and you are working 100 hour weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.080
if you need anything it comes to you straight away&nbsp;
compared to this guy who's working at university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.160
has been wrong 10 years in a row and didn't even&nbsp;
notice and these guys who do that they then go on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.960
to work at the bank of england so you know right&nbsp;
now there's a guy michael saunders on the npc okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.680
he was employed at citibank as an economist right&nbsp;
to analyze uk interest rates while we were trading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.560
uk interest rates we never read a single thing&nbsp;
that that guy wrote you know this guy was a joke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.120
to us right we're getting paid a million pound&nbsp;
a year this guy's getting paid you know 70 grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.320
a year to produce things that we never read you&nbsp;
know who do you think the bank really trusts you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.720
know they're giving us a million pounds a year to&nbsp;
manage the money they're giving this guy 70 grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.480
here to write papers yeah i think it's important&nbsp;
you read to realize these guys in the media these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.440
guys in academia these guys at the bank of england&nbsp;
they're not paid to be right nobody's paying them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.320
to be right this guy at Oxford university can be&nbsp;
wrong for 10 years in a row and never even notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.480
never even notice like that's unforgivable that's&nbsp;
that's horrifically bad right and these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.560
guys who we put in charge of our economy you see&nbsp;
what i'm saying and yeah if you like me have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.120
consistent track record for being right year after&nbsp;
year after year after year you can go and work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.160
get a million pound deal working for goldman&nbsp;
sachs or for jp morgan you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.320
but you can't give the advice to the&nbsp;
government for free because they don't care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.840
because they if listen anyone out there who's&nbsp;
watching right if you work for the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.440
if you care why you're not calling me? you know&nbsp;
what i mean, these guys think i'm worth a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.880
million pounds a year i'm willing to work for free you&nbsp;
see what i'm saying you know why is Rishi Sunak not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.280
calling me? you know why is the labour party not&nbsp;
calling me? or you know why is the conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.080
party not calling me? you know why the university's&nbsp;
not calling me? listen i've been right year after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.440
year and look look at this crisis okay if you&nbsp;
have time now people watching go back and look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.640
at the first video on this channel in that video&nbsp;
i say this crisis is going to cause a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.880
transfer of cash from the government to the rich&nbsp;
that will lead to a massive increase in inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.240
a mass increase in house prices, a mass increase in&nbsp;
stock prices, a massive increase in inflation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.840
a cost of living crisis that's there two years&nbsp;
ago two years ago and it that was not difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.640
to predict if you understand what's happening&nbsp;
it's not difficult to predict okay and yet now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.800
it's actually happened two years ago and they're&nbsp;
still not talking about it what is what is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:52.000
on but if you think about it it makes total sense&nbsp;
right because if at 21 you come in and say listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.520
all of the best guys we're going to pay you a&nbsp;
million quid a year to never ever speak publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.440
and the rest of you who are going to get yourself&nbsp;
200 grand in debt and maybe get half decent job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.080
in 15 years time you are the guys who are going&nbsp;
around the country that's what we're doing that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.800
what we're doing right and i was working in the&nbsp;
bank and i used to bet year after year we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.720
going to have a disaster and these guys just say&nbsp;
here go have a million quid, well done, do it again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.040
this is the world that we live in okay where&nbsp;
we select at 21 all of the best economists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.320
we say you guys are going to bet on it and&nbsp;
we select all of the posh economists who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.160
are not that good and we say you are the&nbsp;
guys who are going to manage it you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.840
it's crazy what's happening and then and&nbsp;
then now we're in a situation where look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.960
it is verifiable fact that 450 billion pounds&nbsp;
was transferred from the government to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.520
during Covid okay verifiable fact okay if&nbsp;
i was to come to you three years ago before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.240
Covid and say imagine the government printed&nbsp;
450 billion pounds and gave it to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.360
what do you think would happen you don't need to&nbsp;
be an economist you'll say okay well if the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.800
get a ton of money they're going to push the&nbsp;
prices up which will be fine for them because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.720
they've got a ton of money that will hurt the rest&nbsp;
of us right and the rich will start to consume a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.800
larger share of the natural resources and natural&nbsp;
resources become more expensive for the rest of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.160
that's not complicated okay that happened it's&nbsp;
obvious it's obvious and that's 450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.480
and now Rishi Sunak is on tv saying oh don't&nbsp;
worry we stand by ready to help with £5 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.920
you give £450 billion to the rich and then&nbsp;
you say we're going to help with five billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.680
pounds it's not it's not going to it's not going&nbsp;
to help right and then Labour say we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.800
do a windfall tax on oil and gas companies&nbsp;
and we're going to raise two billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.160
these guys are so far out of touch you&nbsp;
know they're playing a different game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.280
you know if you transfer 450 billion pounds to&nbsp;
the rich and then you take five billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.080
back you're going to destroy the economy&nbsp;
right but but who's talking about it listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

if you if you work in government okay imagine&nbsp;
you're going to print 450 billion pounds okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.600
of course somebody in government should say&nbsp;
okay well before we give 450 billion pounds out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.120
we should do a report and analysis of&nbsp;
who's going to get the money we should do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.960
an analysis of where the money is going to end&nbsp;
up who did it who did it who did that analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.240
nobody nobody and if anybody is out there in&nbsp;
government or civil service find me that analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.760
please please find me one person in government&nbsp;
he said before we give out 450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.760
we should do an analysis of where the money&nbsp;
ended up okay and that's government okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.200
name me one person in the media who did that&nbsp;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.480
i did it march 2020 what why is it why am i the&nbsp;
only guy doing it if you if you're giving out 450&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.800
billion pounds you need to do an analysis where&nbsp;
the money is ending up nobody in government did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:41.760
it nobody in media did it who are these people you&nbsp;
know it's insane not a single person but then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.640
know and i was speaking the other day to somebody&nbsp;
from a media institution or who i won't name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.200
and i said why did nobody at your place do it you&nbsp;
know and this guy works for a big newspaper in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:59.040
london and i said okay answer me one question you&nbsp;
work for a big global newspaper in london is there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:09.200
anyone in your office that sounds like me anyone&nbsp;
no listen if you run a global organization based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.920
in london and you don't have a single person&nbsp;
on your staff who sounds like me you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.760
because how can you possibly have the best&nbsp;
people but look we've created a system where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.600
you can get paid a million pound a year over there&nbsp;
or you could get you want to work in media you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.360
have to work for seven-eight years on 30 grand a&nbsp;
year you have to do unpaid internships only rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.520
people can afford these jobs so we end up with&nbsp;
media full of rich idiots government full of rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.080
idiots universities full of rich idiots and anyone&nbsp;
who's half smart is making a million quid over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.480
there to shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and you're surprised&nbsp;
when the economy is a disaster this is what we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.120
done we've created a system where we selectively&nbsp;
pick all of the best people who should be helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.240
to fix this economy to protect the people of this&nbsp;
country to build a good future for this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.320
and for the world and all they're allowed to do&nbsp;
is sit over there and bet on disaster making money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.920
for themselves you know i'm out here listen i'm&nbsp;
willing to support the government if they actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.240
want to help this economy i'm here they can call&nbsp;
me i'm willing to work they're not calling me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.680
the worst thing is they didn't even know what&nbsp;
they don't even realize how bad they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.320
up who is talking about that 450 billion pounds 10&nbsp;
000 pounds per person look if the government were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.160
to bring in a policy now where they taxed every&nbsp;
person in the country ten thousand pounds and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.120
gave it all to the rich, people would be rioting on&nbsp;
the streets they've done it that is what they did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.720
and not a single person in the media is&nbsp;
talking about it so if anybody's watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.040
who works in the media please ask yourself&nbsp;
why are you not talking about that money

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.800
you can't give 450 billion pounds to the&nbsp;
rich and expect no consequences you cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.920
do that and expect no consequences but we live&nbsp;
in a world where anybody who is entitled to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.520
voice in economics which is academics people&nbsp;
in the media people at the bank of england&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.560
people in government has been specifically&nbsp;
selected for not being very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.720
and anyone who is good can make a&nbsp;
million pounds to never say anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.840
and if that is the system you build of economics&nbsp;
do you expect to get good outcomes for society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.440
well you don't you will get the outcomes you get&nbsp;
which is me sitting here making a ton of cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.320
and the economy going to absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for&nbsp;
the whole world you know what i mean so look

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.880
economics is broken it's badly broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.080
people in the media need to wake up and look at&nbsp;
what's happening um ordinary people out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.600
you know if you know anyone in media and&nbsp;
government ask them this one simple question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.400
has anyone in your organization done a serious&nbsp;
analysis of who got that 450 billion pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:52.480
450 billion pounds and the amounts the&nbsp;
government is talking about to help 5 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.560
six billion after giving up 450 billion you know&nbsp;
and if you know anyone who works for any of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.160
newspapers you know is the Daily Mail mentioned&nbsp;
it? no. has the Guard ian mentioned it? no. has The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.840
Sun mentioned it? has The Mirror mentioned it
you know? no. has The Times mentioned it you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.400
the Financial Times probably have and these&nbsp;
guys are reading it you know what i mean but

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.040
it's a joke it's a comedy so i&nbsp;
think people need to understand that

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.560
we've destroyed economics and you know i was at&nbsp;
oxford university for two years the world would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.080
be a better place if they just burned that&nbsp;
department down because these guys have no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.040
idea what's happening no idea what's happening&nbsp;
they don't think about inequality ever they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.400
been wrong for 10 years they didn't notice it and&nbsp;
the problem is you know they don't get hurt they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.280
don't get hurt they don't get punished they don't&nbsp;
get hit by its ordinary people that lose out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.240
these guys literally have dinner in their harry potter&nbsp;
hallways every day you know what i mean they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.840
paid a nice salary and they're wrong year after year&nbsp;
after year after year and they don't even notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.880
and you know i remember when i was there having&nbsp;
my one midyear review when i told them this and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.840
said what do you mean? you know things are getting&nbsp;
better sitting there in a wood paneled room in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.840
castle with these guys wearing their capes saying&nbsp;
things are getting better and you couldn't help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.600
but hear those two missing words you know things&nbsp;
are getting better for us you know because for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.040
those guys it's totally fine for all of these&nbsp;
guys working for the guardian and working in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.040
bank of england you know andrew bailey gets paid&nbsp;
half a million quid a year to be wrong every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:31.840
every single one of these posh idiots is totally&nbsp;
fine and it's ordinary people who are getting hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.640
so it's a joke i mean it's a disgrace really&nbsp;
and we need to fix it um but look i'm out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.280
here trying to fix it so if anyone in the&nbsp;
government is listening wake up because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.080
things are gonna get worse and worse and worse&nbsp;
seriously and look i'm not just saying that i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.560
betting on it and i'm the guy that's been right&nbsp;
for 10 years in a row and um these are the guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:01.840
who've been wrong so people listening should&nbsp;
think about who they trust um but things can uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.360
things can be fixed but only if we start&nbsp;
addressing the fact that we gave 450 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:16.920
pounds to a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] billionaires we don't&nbsp;
fix that - it doesn't get better so hopefully we will

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.980
happy?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.240
there you go...
