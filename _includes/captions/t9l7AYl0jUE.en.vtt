00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.760
My name is Gary Stevenson i grew up around here&nbsp;
in East London from quite a poor family in quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.960
a poor area but in 2008 when i was 21 i got a&nbsp;
job working for Citibank in canary wharf not far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.320
from here as an interest rate trader my job was to&nbsp;
bet whether interest rates would go up or go down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.880
now interest rates go up when the economy is&nbsp;strong 
and they come down when the economy is weak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.400
so basically my job is to bet on the strength of&nbsp;
the global economy now when i started working in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.600
2008 there was a global financial crisis and all&nbsp;
the rates in the whole world came down to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.320
so very quickly my job was to bet on when will&nbsp;
the rates recover which is basically a bet on when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.400
will the global economy recover now the history of&nbsp;
this is super interesting in 2008 governments and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.920
central banks all over the world printed a huge&nbsp;
amount of money and pushed it into the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.720
that meant that stock prices bounced super quickly&nbsp;
and economists and traders predicted that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.720
economy would recover super quickly too so in&nbsp;
2008 they predicted a v-shaped recovery for 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.360
now in 2009 that didn't happen that&nbsp;
prediction got pushed back to 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.920
in 2010 it got pushed back to 2011. in 2011 it&nbsp;
got pushed back to 2012. in 2012 it was 2013 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.440
back last year in 2020 they were still predicting&nbsp;a
recovery for later that year and yet here we are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.200
2021 with global interest rates just like&nbsp;
the global economy still at emergency lows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.080
now before i started working in the city i studied&nbsp;
economics and i became fascinated in understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.640
why are our predictions always wrong? why do&nbsp;
we always predict the economy is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.280
recover when it doesn't recover? when is the&nbsp;
economy going to recover? will it ever recover?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.240
and underlying those questions is&nbsp;
one big question why aren't people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.840
spending more money? now in 2008 when that huge&nbsp;
wave of new money got pushed into the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.640
economists thought people are going to&nbsp;
spend this money and that's going to cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
a massive economic boom when that didn't&nbsp;
happen economists didn't understand why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.120
but for me having grown up around here in a place&nbsp;
like this i felt that i could understand why now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.200
if you print a huge amount of money it's important&nbsp;
where that money goes people like my family people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.280
like the people i grew up with people like&nbsp;
the people around here who would have spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.480
that money if they got it weren't getting it&nbsp;
instead the money was going to people like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.960
the people i was working with in the city or even&nbsp;
the super rich people whose money we were moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040
now the problem is when money goes to the rich and&nbsp;
the super rich they don't spend it that means it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.400
doesn't boost the economy instead they use it to&nbsp;
buy stocks and houses that pushes stock prices and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.120
house prices up when that happens it doesn't help&nbsp;
ordinary people it makes it harder for ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.560
people to save and it makes it harder for ordinary&nbsp;
people to buy houses that means if we print money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.360
but it only goes to the rich it doesn't make the&nbsp;
economy better in fact it makes the economy worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.320
now i could see that if we didn't fix inequality&nbsp;
the global economy was not going to recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.600
since economists and politicians weren't 
doing&nbsp;anything about it i could tell that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.240
economy wasn't going to get better any time soon&nbsp;
i bet that the global economy would stay weak for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.280
years and that made me Citibank's most profitable&nbsp;
trader and that's how i became a millionaire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.800
because i knew the difference between the&nbsp;
economy down here and the economy over there

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.640
listen if we don't do anything about wealth&nbsp;
inequality the economy doesn't get better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.560
housing doesn't become more affordable, wages&nbsp;
don't go up, well paid jobs don't become easy to&nbsp;get

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.720
all those things get worse, all those things&nbsp;
get more difficult, the economy for our kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.960
will be worse than this economy and the&nbsp;
economy for their kids will be worse than that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.160
now i'm not just saying these things i'm betting&nbsp;
on them i've been betting on them for 13 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.440
i've been right for 13 years and&nbsp;
i've made millions of pounds doing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.400
but things don't have to turn out that way and&nbsp;
i don't want them to there is an alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.120
if we actually start reducing wealth inequality&nbsp;
rather than letting it continue to grow we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.560
put that cycle into reverse we can make the money&nbsp;
go to ordinary people and make their lives better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.840
that will make ordinary people richer and not&nbsp;
only that but ordinary people are going to spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.520
the money that's going to make the economy&nbsp;
stronger it's going to make the economy boom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.800
more jobs higher wages more opportunities the&nbsp;
opportunity to actually make money to get rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.480
for ordinary people the chance to get good quality&nbsp;
housing the chance to have financial security to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
raise a family without having to worry just&nbsp;
about paying the mortgage or paying the bills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.840
these are the things that we could have if&nbsp;
we actually start reducing wealth inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.560
it's possible to do this at the moment we have&nbsp;
a tax system which is very efficient at taxing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.200
ordinary working people but very inefficient&nbsp;
attacks in the super rich often they end up paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.880
extremely low rates attacks close to zero percent&nbsp;
but in the past we have had tax systems which make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.520
richer people pay more this was the case in the&nbsp;
50s and 60s here in Britain and the result was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.760
booming economy with low unemployment good jobs&nbsp;
and affordable housing listen that was 60 or 70&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.400
years ago if we were to bring in a progressive tax&nbsp;
system like that now the kind of economic boom we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.560
could have could be enormous and that could be&nbsp;
achieved using a wealth tax the idea behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.320
wealth tax is that billionaires and millionaires&nbsp;
should pay higher rates of tax than everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.280
else ordinary people will not be taxed more but&nbsp;
that money could be used to improve education&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.000
to improve health care or to reduce the rates of&nbsp;
tax currently being paid by you and hard-working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.720
families it's finally been supported by prominent&nbsp;
economists and politicians all around the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.920
and now it has a real chance of happening listen&nbsp;
i'm a millionaire and attacks on millionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.080
and billionaires is going to hit me too but&nbsp;
i can see what's going to happen if we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.160
fix a broken economic system it's going to get&nbsp;
worse and worse and it's not going to be pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.160
but a different future is possible we can have&nbsp;
affordable housing we can have good quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:05.840
jobs but we can only have it if we fix wealth&nbsp;
inequality support the wealth tax i do 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.920
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.240
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.960
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
