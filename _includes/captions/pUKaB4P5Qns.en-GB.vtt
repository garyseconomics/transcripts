00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Okay.

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.320
Today, we are going to explain why

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.640
Labour is crushing your living standards.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.080
So if you are watching this video on Sunday the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.240
30th of March, which is when it's gonna go out,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.120
or shortly afterwards, you will be watching in the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.080
immediate aftermath of Labour's Spring Statement.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.560
The news will have been absolutely covered in

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.880
discussion of things like fiscal rules and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.560
government bond rates and forecasts for growth.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.520
And you're probably be expecting that I

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.840
will do something on the Spring Statement.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.360
But to be honest, at times like this, when we have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.760
these kind of theatrical political set plays, I often

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.520
get frustrated with the way the media has a kind of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.680
a fixation with nailing in on the specific details.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.560
Which tax has he risen?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.080
or which tax has she risen?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.520
Which spending has she cut?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.040
And there's very often very little discussion

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.760
of what is actually happening in the big picture.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Why is Labour choosing to do austerity 2.0?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.640
What are the reasons driving basically

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.120
the need for, for Labour to do this?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.720
Why are they being forced to do this?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.240
When I was a trader, one of the first

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.000
things which I found really interesting was that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.600
you very quickly realise as a trader that the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.120
things which are portrayed as important on the news

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.920
are very often not important for traders at all.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
And the things which are important for traders in the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.480
markets are very often not shown in the news at all.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.080
So you have a situation where the news likes these

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.160
kind of set plays, like budgets, spring statements,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.360
but really what matters for traders, the economy

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.160
for your living standards are what are the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.440
big picture, long-term changes in the economy?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.280
So what I want to do today is I want

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.840
to explain why it is that Labour is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.400
doing austerity 2.0, why Labour is cutting spending,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200
cutting benefits, raising taxes on workers.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.040
Why is Labour crushing your living standards?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.200
So I was very pessimistic about

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
Labour before the election.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.680
I was very confident that they would basically

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.960
fail to significantly grow the economy, that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.240
they would preside over falling living standards.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.720
And I thought there was always a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.080
significant risk that they would basically

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.800
move into this austerity 2.0 space.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.200
And, the reason for this is because I understood

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.880
the big picture trend which has dominated the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.280
economy really for the last 20 years, really,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.960
but especially since, for the last five years,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.280
since COVID, which I am calling the squeeze out.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.480
The squeeze out of the working class, the squeeze out

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.600
of the middle class, the squeeze out of the government.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.360
And in this video, we're going to go

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.920
through nice and slowly, in detail what

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.320
the squeeze out is and how it affects you.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.640
Okay.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.920
So the squeeze out really is kind of a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.760
new way of framing something that I've

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.240
been speaking about for a long time.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.840
But I've been really moving

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.280
towards this kind of framing recently.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.600
And I think it's a really powerful way

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.720
to explain to ordinary people what's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.640
happening and how it affects them.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.280
So on this channel, I speak a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.000
lot about wealth inequality.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360
But I think wealth inequality,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.640
as a concept, can sound a little bit academic.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.200
It can sound a little bit idealistic, egalitarian.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.640
People can kind of think this is politics

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880
of envy, how does that affect me?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.440
And I think the squeeze out is a focus on really the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.840
most damaging and most dangerous direct consequence

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.640
of wealth inequality for ordinary people, which is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.800
that the rich accumulate an enormous amount of money.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640
And they use that to out-compete other

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.800
groups in society, such as the working

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.920
class and the middle class, for assets.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.480
Meaning that over time, the working class and the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.760
middle class have less and less and less assets,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.920
and go further and further and further into debt.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
And to be honest, it was an understanding of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.440
this phenomenon which actually led me to become

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.400
interested in wealth inequality in the first place.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.120
When I was a trader in the aftermath of 2008,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.760
everybody was predicting a strong economic recovery.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.200
But I couldn't help but notice that ordinary families

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.640
were getting poorer and poorer year after year,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.840
generation after generation, and so were the government.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.000
And this was basically what led me to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.600
understanding that inequality is important.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.200
So if we reframe and focus instead of wealth inequality

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.240
itself and on the squeezing out of the working class

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.520
and the middle class, I think it makes it a lot more

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.240
visceral and powerful for ordinary people, ordinary

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.720
families like you, because you start to see what this

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.040
means is me and my family are gonna lose our wealth.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.160
We're gonna lose our houses.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.760
We're gonna get driven into debt.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.840
Okay.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.520
So what I'm gonna do from now is basically a nice

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.400
historical lesson of the history of wealth inequality.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.080
I'm gonna focus mainly on this country, in the UK.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.160
And we're gonna talk about how ordinary

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.640
families got wealth and how they got

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.440
squeezed out and are being squeezed out.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.720
Okay.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.680
So first, some historical context.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.320
The period 70 years after World War

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640
II is not historically normal, and

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640
it's not internationally normal.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.920
During that period of 70 years, we saw

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.320
a lot of ordinary people, a lot of ordinary

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.520
families, people earning average or even

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.400
less than average incomes being able to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.120
own homes without significant debt, get things

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.880
like pensions, basically own a chunk of the wealth.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.920
That is not common.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.600
If you go to most of the world, to be honest,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.520
outside Europe and North America, if you go to most

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.520
countries in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.960
what you see is small, very wealthy elites and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.280
a very small middle class below that.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.280
And that most people live, don't own significant wealth.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.400
What they own is worth very little

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920
and they live in poverty.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.080
And that was true in Europe and in

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.800
this country, the UK, and in the United

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.120
States for most of history as well.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.000
And that is basically, to be honest, that is the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.520
long term history of sort of post-agricultural

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.520
human civilisations, is you tend to have a

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.840
small elite and a lot of poverty around them.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.560
In the history of this country, the UK, you do

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.000
have sort of a couple of historical examples when

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.160
working people were able to get themself a little

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.480
bit more power and a little bit more wealth.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.440
After the plague, after the Black

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.800
Death when 50% of the population of Europe

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.120
died, working people were a bit more needed.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.880
They were able to get a little bit more of a share.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.040
You were able to see women get a bit more of a share

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.640
than they did historically at that point in time.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.640
During the Industrial Revolution, in the Industrial

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.240
Revolution, you had a period where basically

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.400
all of the world's production was happening in,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.440
you know, a small part of Northwestern Europe.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.640
And after a lot of fighting, ordinary working

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.640
people were again able to get a bit of a share.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.120
But even then realistically, these societies

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.080
lived in very high levels of inequality, most

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.120
of the wealth owned by super elite.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.680
But in the 20th century, this all changed basically.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.480
People sometimes forget that even at the

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.720
beginning of the 20th century, the 1900s, there

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.200
was still really, really widespread poverty and

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.920
extreme inequality even in this country, the UK.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.400
My grandmother, who was born in the '20s,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400
saw I think three or four of her siblings

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.960
die of tuberculosis, which is basically a

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.800
disease, a preventable disease of poverty.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
Yeah, people lived in desperate

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.320
poverty in the early 20th century.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.840
But during and immediately after World War

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.520
II, there was really significant change here.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.800
And what you see if you compare pre-World War II

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.920
to post-World War II is suddenly a massive increase

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.840
in wealth holding of the government and some of that

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.480
wealth being held by the middle class and eventually

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.560
even significant amounts of working class wealth.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.240
So I often talk about how my dad worked for the post

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240
office making 20 grand a year, less than average wage.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.920
And, he was able to buy property, things like that.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.880
So what you see is suddenly

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.480
this historic wealth dynamic of the rich owning

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.680
everything changes in the 20th century.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.720
And I think that the key to

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.960
that is basically World War II.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.200
And I think World War II sees basically, like,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.520
a big shift in the ownership of wealth.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.120
And, to be honest, I would like to

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.640
understand a little bit more about exactly how

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.040
that wealth shifts during World War II from

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.360
being owned by the rich, to being owned

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.280
by the government and by ordinary people.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.480
I've been looking into it.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.880
I've got my theories.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.800
Probably we'll get an expert in

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.800
to speak about it one day.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.640
I think it's interesting to consider because at the

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.560
moment when there is a lot of attention on, can we tax

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.440
the rich, people sometimes forget that the 20th century

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.960
is a really good example of the fact that wealth can

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.360
be redistributed, It doesn't just have to flow one way.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.440
It can flow back to ordinary people.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.680
But what you need to know for now

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.960
is essentially World War II saw

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.360
a really historic shift in who owns the wealth.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.960
And it was no longer owned just by a small elite, and

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.760
it was suddenly owned in large part by the government

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.040
and by the middle class and by the working class.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.520
And in the period 30, 40 years after World War

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.880
II, this kind of stayed relatively unchanged.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.920
And this was largely because in that period, we

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.560
had very, very high rates of tax on rich people,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.120
which essentially prevented the flow of wealth, which

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.800
I talk about a lot on this channel, from happening.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.520
So whenever you have inequality, you have this kind of

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.320
problematic, you know, monopoly game style situation,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.080
which is these guys own the assets, these guys don't.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.240
You have to pay your salary to them.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.560
And over time, that wealth

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.440
difference grows and grows and grows.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.200
But in the 50s, 60s, 70s, we had very high rates of

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.480
tax on the richest, which basically prevented the

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.680
rich from accumulating money and buying up the assets.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.880
Then in the 80s, you have the Thatcher in this country,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.480
Reagan in the US governments come in and, basically

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.360
totally rewrite the story around economics.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.840
Lots of people don't like Thatcher and Reagan,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.040
but I think when you look back at what they did,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.760
we can kind of view them as a, as a hopeful example that

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.600
tax policies can be changed, distributions can be

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.880
changed, the story about economics can be changed.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.520
And these guys basically changed the story.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.600
I will add that's what we're

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.720
trying to do on this channel, basically,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.240
change the story about economics.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.720
Thatcher and Reagan came in, they changed

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.160
the story on economics, and they massively,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.840
massively slashed taxation on the richest people.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.800
And as soon as you do that, that's

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.960
when the squeeze out begins.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.640
And we enter stage one of the squeeze out.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.160
Okay, so part one of the squeeze out, taxes

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.600
have been cut on rich people in the 80s.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.200
And suddenly, rich people start

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.760
to accumulate a lot of money.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.440
Now, one key feature of rich people, which I speak about

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.600
a lot on the channel, is that rich people have what

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.720
economists call a low marginal propensity to consume.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.200
What that means is if you give rich

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.640
people a lot of money, they will not

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.720
increase their consumption significantly.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.080
What they will do instead is they will

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.480
start to buy significantly assets.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.280
So the rich get lot of money, they start buying assets.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.480
The first thing you see is asset prices rising.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.360
You start to see stock markets... you

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.480
start to see stock markets going up, and

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.520
you start to see house prices going up.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.960
What's interesting about this is most people

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.800
perceive this stage one as a really good thing.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.480
So, you know, we're existing in this post-war economy

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.160
where lots of people, even poorer people own assets, and

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.280
they start to see their house price go up, or they start

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.480
to see their stock holdings go up if you're in a country

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.240
where, like the US or Germany where people own stocks.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.400
People are really excited, like, "My house

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.480
price is going up, stock price is going up.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.760
Like, this is really, really good."

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.720
And I think what people don't realise is those

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.880
rising stock prices and those rising house

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.680
prices are basically a manifestation of the rich

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.840
starting to squeeze people out of asset holding.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.520
And, what you will see first is the

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.880
very poorest people will respond to these

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.400
increased asset prices by selling their assets.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.080
And I think the first thing that you saw was,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.640
in particular, older people from poorer families

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.880
using that, I suppose, asset windfall to

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.160
give themselves more comfortable retirements.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.760
I want to point out, comfortable retirements are not

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.240
a historical or an international norm, but

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.200
this is a thing which we started to get in

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.440
particular in this first stage of the squeeze out.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.360
So if you're... if you're poor, you've lived a

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.360
poor life and suddenly you see your house price

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.680
going up, what you are probably gonna do is

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.200
you're gonna say, "Okay, this is great.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.120
I'm gonna use that increased price to give myself

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.800
a little bit of luxury, and a little bit of comfort

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.120
in my retirement." And what this means is the

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.560
first stage of the squeeze out, it feels great

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.040
even for the poor, especially if you own property.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.840
You're like, "My asset price is going up,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.000
I'm gonna sell the asset and I'm going

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.760
to live a better life." So what we see is

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.800
in the first stage, the rich are accumulating

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.440
money, but they are not using that to out-compete

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.760
the poor or the middle class for consumption, which

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.680
means living standards don't fall for ordinary people.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.200
What they are doing is they're using it

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.280
to squeeze the weakest hands, which is the

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.240
historical working class, out of ownership

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.960
of assets, out of ownership of property.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.560
Now, that goes on and on, and eventually you start

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.160
to see property prices are going up and up and up.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.480
Poorer families eventually over time are

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.600
owning less and less housing.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.920
I think a really good example of this is, the

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.080
Right to Buy scheme here in the UK, which is when

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.320
the UK government sold off its housing to poorer people,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.320
and those poorer people owned their houses for

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.320
a bit, eventually sold them in order to fund

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.280
decent retirements and ended up owning nothing.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.920
Now, the properties are owned by rich people

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.720
and they're buy to let properties, and the

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.960
poor end up with the government having no

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.000
assets and themselves having no assets.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.240
This is a really, really good example of how

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.840
in stage one of the squeeze out asset prices

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.720
get pushed up and up and up and up and up, and

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.560
that squeezes out the weakest hands in society

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.760
who are in the first place, the working class.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.720
But the working class often, and this is not

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.280
just the working class, the squeezed out class

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.200
often enjoys it because they are able to consume

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.840
more while they are dis-saving their wealth.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.440
And they often don't look down the line and

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.080
think, "What's gonna happen when we don't

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.800
have any wealth left?" So what you see here is

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.080
weaker and weaker hands dis-saving their assets,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.560
getting poorer and poorer in wealth terms, but

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.720
using that to sustain a good quality of life.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.960
And I think I'll just make it clear what dis-saving is.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.480
Dis-saving is I have some wealth

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.800
and I'm gonna, for a period of time, spend more

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.800
than my income by basically selling the wealth

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.680
that I have to the rich or by taking on debt.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.880
So dis-saving is... dis-saving is really a key

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.600
concept to understanding the squeeze out, which

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.040
is, I have some assets, over time I sell them

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.360
to the rich, and that enables me to live a good

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.840
quality of life while I'm being squeezed out.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.520
So you kind of have people cheering

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.480
on their own demise in a sense.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.080
But over time, less and less

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.520
and less poor people own homes.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.480
The asset price goes up and up.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.960
Rich people are accumulating more

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.920
wealth and accumulating more money.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.720
And you reach a situation where the only

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.160
way for especially the working class,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.320
but also often the middle class, to own

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.120
homes, to compete with the rich for ownership

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.400
of homes, is to borrow the money from the rich.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.280
So you're seeing less ownership of property and

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.680
increasing levels of debt, increasing size of mortgages.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.640
And this keeps happening.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.320
The rich get richer and richer and richer,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.400
house prices go up and up and up and up, levels

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.720
of debt increase and increase and increase.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.200
And eventually you reach a point where the rich are

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.800
looking at the poor and the middle class and they're

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.880
saying, "Well, you don't have any assets anymore.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.360
You are in a massive amount of debt to us.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.760
We don't think you are creditworthy anymore." And

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.520
that is when you enter stage two of the squeeze out.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.200
So when we get to stage two, you have

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.320
this problem where basically a big chunk

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.400
of society can't borrow money anymore.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.360
And this happens in 2008.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.640
So up until 2008, a big chunk of society is

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.280
getting squeezed out, but they're able to still

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.080
spend because the rich are lending to them.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.360
They basically reach a point where the

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.600
rich says, "They're no longer in good credit.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.000
Let's stop lending to them." And that

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.400
is when you enter an economic crisis.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.200
Suddenly the lending is not there.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.680
This means a massive chunk of society can't afford to

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.480
spend and you essentially enter an economic depression.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.840
People can't spend, businesses shut down.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.400
That means even more people can't spend.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.760
And that is for the first point in the squeeze out

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.440
when the rich are not only taking your assets, but

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.240
they start to basically not allow you to consume.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.880
And what this of course means is

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.960
there's a massive increase in poverty.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.440
Suddenly people lose their job, people

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.760
can't borrow, people can't spend, there's

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.600
a massive economic depression, and that

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.160
means that governments have to step in.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.120
So here in Western Europe, we generally live in

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.680
welfare states where the governments have a kind

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.640
of theoretical responsibility to make sure that the

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.600
majority of their populations stay out of poverty.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.080
But the majority of the population

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.840
by the beginning of stage two, they've

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.960
got no wealth, they've got no power.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.400
They basically have no way to

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.080
keep themselves out of poverty.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.920
So governments step in.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.040
But the government has a problem, which is the rich

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.560
are getting richer and richer and richer and richer.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.960
They have the assets.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.200
This group of people, the working

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.520
class, they've got nothing.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.960
The government needs the assets from

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.040
the rich to support the working class.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.760
But unfortunately, the government has been very

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.920
reluctant to tax the rich, so they turn around to

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.680
the rich and they say, "What do you want in order

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.520
for you to allow the poor to, to live, to have a good

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.880
quality of life?" And the rich basically say to the

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.760
government the same thing that they said to the poor,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.200
which was, "We want your assets and we'll

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.680
lend you the money." And then, then you see basically

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.400
the exact same thing happening to government, which

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.680
happened to the poor in stage one, which is the

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.800
rich... The government gradually sells off its

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.400
assets, sells off its assets, sells off its assets.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.560
Government dis-saving essentially.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.480
Asset prices start to go up again because the

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.840
rich are getting richer and richer and richer.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.880
And I think it's worth noting that after 2008, even

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.960
though the initial move was a crash in asset prices,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.480
there was then a massive increase in asset prices.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.560
The government are put in the same

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.360
situation that the working class were in.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.200
The only way they can support living standards for the

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.320
working class is to sell their assets and to take debt.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.000
And the government gets poorer and poorer

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
and poorer, fewer and fewer assets, and

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.720
more and more and more and more debt.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.360
And I think we'll try and flash up a graph of Thomas

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.120
Piketty's data on the wealth of governments, which

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.760
has massively, massively collapsed in the last 20 years.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.040
So what you see on this graph is a graph by the

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.720
French economist Thomas Piketty looking at the wealth

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.000
levels, total amount of assets versus total amount

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.960
of debt of all of the world's biggest governments.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.800
And what you see here is the US and also

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.360
European governments, basically their

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.360
wealth has collapsed all the way to zero.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.720
It's worth noting that this graph stops before

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.680
COVID, and in COVID, these wealth levels collapsed.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.680
So what you have now is a situation where basically

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.240
western governments are not only zero wealth,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.080
they're actually massively in negative wealth.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.560
And this is a perfect example of the government

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.280
being squeezed out, just like the poor were.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.480
So what you have there is basically stage

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.360
two and stage three of the squeeze out.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.400
Stage two is the economic depression.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.960
Ordinary people can't spend.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.560
Suddenly there is a collapse in consumption,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.400
a first collapse in living standards.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.880
And stage three is the government stepping in, the

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.880
government supporting living standards, but the

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.560
government gradually itself getting squeezed out.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.080
Eventually when the government runs out of

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.720
wealth and is too far in debt to borrow any

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.240
further, that is when we enter stage four.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.120
So stage four is basically where we are now.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.040
And I think stage four perfectly explains what is

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.840
happening now to the UK government, what increasingly

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.000
will happen to the US government, what increasingly

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.240
will happen to European governments, which is

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.520
the government has tried to step in to protect

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.040
the poor who are having their wealth squeezed

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.960
out by this rapidly growing wealth of the rich.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.520
And as a result of doing that, they have

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.080
had their own wealth squeezed out, and

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.200
now they have no wealth left either.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.680
And they are left in a situation where

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.920
there's basically nothing they can do.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.520
Well, there is one thing they could do.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.400
They could tax the rich, but whilst that is off

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.960
the table, they really simply have no choice

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.280
but to shut down the welfare states, because

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.720
we are moving back to that pre-World War II

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.840
period where all of the wealth, all of the

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.600
assets, all of the power are held by the rich.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.560
The working class have nothing left.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.920
The government have nothing left.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.600
They have no wealth in order to provide you with

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600
the things which they are supposed to provide you.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.960
So what you see and what we have seen in the last 10, 15

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.080
years and what we will see more aggressively in the next

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.640
10 years is basically the shutting down of government.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.440
So you see the closing of local services, you

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.520
see the aggressive contraction of welfare,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.240
you see the defunding of the courts and the

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.120
defunding of the police, and eventually the

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.240
defunding of things like education and healthcare.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.920
We saw the defunding of social housing a long time ago.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.360
Basically because the government have been

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.040
squeezed out, they have no choice but to

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.480
basically shut down all of these services.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.200
And I think, I think this is the part of the discussion

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.160
which is never really spoken about by economists

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.480
and never really spoken about in the media.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.760
I think what you will have seen... And we are shooting

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.680
this before the spring statement came out, by the way.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.080
But what you will have seen is the government...

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.640
the media talking a lot about fiscal rules without

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.400
really recognising the underlying reality, which is all

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.640
of the wealth has gone increasingly to a small elite.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.440
And that means that the government really, if

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.800
they're not willing to tax the elite with that

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.880
wealth, the only option they have is to try and

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.720
squeeze as much as they can the one remaining

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.080
section of society which has a bit of wealth and

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.440
has a bit of power, which is the middle class.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.400
And that is kind of what the government is doing.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.480
They're trying to fill this middle gap

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.760
of, "We're gonna tax the middle class

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.760
because they're the only guys with wealth.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.360
We're gonna try to borrow from the rich." But really

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.840
all that does is further squeeze out the next weakest

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.240
hand, which is the middle class, and further enrich

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.600
the guys who are doing the squeezing, which is the rich.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.040
And then you end up in a situation which

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.840
I think increasingly we are coming into

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.880
and we will come into, where basically

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.720
nobody has any wealth except for the rich.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.080
And then what you start to see is the

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.520
physical transformation of society,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.760
which is, we have lived for the last 70 years

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.720
in middle class, working class societies.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.440
And what I mean by that is we have lived in societies

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.880
which unusually have provided things such as good

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.480
quality housing and education and healthcare and goods

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.520
and services to the middle class and the working class.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.120
But those guys have no wealth and no power anymore.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.960
So you need to change what you produce, you

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.320
need to change the physical shape of your

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.360
economy, and you need to stop producing things

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.600
for the working class, stop producing things for the

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.160
middle class and start producing only for the rich.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.400
And I think a couple good historical examples of

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.600
these are the famous potato famine in Ireland where

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.880
basically food was being grown in Ireland

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.840
and exported to rich people who... while

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.880
the Irish died because they were poor.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.880
I think of the famines in India where people were

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.720
dying in India because the fields were growing

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.880
tea that was being sent halfway across the world.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.960
I think another great

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.960
example of that is, is MrBeast.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.040
MrBeast goes to Africa, he spends $500 to

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.240
give a kid their eyesight back forever.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.280
The reason that that kid doesn't have his eyesight is

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.280
because he lives in a very unequal country, he is a

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.560
member of the poor class, he does not get anything.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.960
He's been fully squeezed out.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.920
The resources that he needs to get his eyesight back are

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.040
being used by the rich and he can't compete with them.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.040
So you need to move into a completely transformed

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.400
society, which does not produce anything

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.800
for the poor or for the middle class.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.760
I think the best example you can see of

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.440
that, especially here where I live, is housing.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.440
So I grew up in Ilford, in East London.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.760
It was a, it was a working class street we

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.800
grew up in, it was quite a working class town.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.160
lots of small families

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.920
living in small terraced houses.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.920
But it was respectable, it was dignified.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.320
There was a degree of space.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.360
And if you go back to Ilford now, you'll

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.760
see that physical transformation, which is

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.800
all of those houses have been expanded up,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.440
they've been expanded back, they're rented

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.560
out by the room, quality of life is very low.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.000
It's basically a slum.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.080
There's all of these enormous blocks of tiny,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.040
tiny flats which have very low standard of

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.000
living inside them. And what you are seeing

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.080
here is the building of the slum.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.560
And if you go into Central London, you will see these

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.320
unbelievably luxurious flats being built everywhere.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.280
You will see luxurious restaurants, luxurious

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.480
hotels, luxurious bars, absolutely full of

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.640
rich people because rich people have taken

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.240
all the wealth, they've squeezed everyone else

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.760
out, and they are taking all the resources.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.880
So this is it, really.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.360
This is what is dominating the government situation, which

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.000
is not getting spoken about much, which is weak hands

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.880
are being progressively squeezed out of our society.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.400
I think if you're from the working

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.880
class, if you're from a poor family,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.760
you've been able to see that for a while.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.160
If you're from a more middle-class situation, you

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.640
might not have realised it's starting coming for you.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.480
But this is the way that it goes.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.520
The working class gets squeezed out first, then

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.440
the government gets squeezed out, then the middle

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.480
class gets squeezed out, and eventually you move

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.880
to this kind of South Africa-style, Brazil-style,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.160
India-style economy where everything is owned

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.040
by the rich and no one else has anything left.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.320
This is what is dominating our political narrative.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.800
And unless the government does something

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.640
about this squeeze out, there will be

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.080
basically nothing that they can do.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.000
And this will simply go further and further.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.560
It will get worse and worse.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.200
I think it's interesting to ask, what do the

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.280
rich do once they've squeezed everybody else out?

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.360
Because at this point, they will have

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.280
enormous amounts of passive income.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.640
There'll be no weak hands to squeeze out of the economy.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.640
The only thing that they can do with their enormous

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.000
income, their enormous wealth, their enormous

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.080
resources, is try to squeeze out each other.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.320
And historically, that basically means war.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.400
The rich have everything.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.080
They want more.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.280
The only people you can take from are other rich people.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.280
And, you know, this is the history of Europe, you know.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.200
And World War II essentially was the

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.320
climax of it, you know, the Holocaust,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.360
the nuclear bombing of Japan.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.480
This basically was the logical endpoint of the continual

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.120
squeeze out, which is the rich take more, the rich

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.520
take more, the rich take more, the rich takes more.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.200
And eventually, you have nothing, and you're

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.080
worthless, and you can be used as a pawn in a war.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.520
But we're not there yet.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.760
What I wanna talk about right now is how this is

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.640
relevant to the statement that came out in the

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.040
week, which is, the government is essentially

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.960
rowing a boat with a massive hole in the bottom.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.960
Your wealth is being squeezed out.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.280
You are losing your power.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.960
The government is losing wealth and power.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.800
The rich are getting richer and

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.480
richer and richer every day.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.760
And the reality of that is

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.920
you simply have to get poorer.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.200
You are losing your relative position in society.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.560
And until you, the working class, the middle classes

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.720
of the UK, the US, and the government are willing

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.320
to start putting that in reverse, there simply is

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.920
no alternative other than to shut the welfare state

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.960
down and to basically drive yourself into poverty.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.480
Okay, so to recap, the squeeze out is why the

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.200
government is destroying your living standards.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.480
It's why you and your family and

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.280
your kids will be increasingly poor.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.120
There are five stages of the squeeze out.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.640
Stage one, the rich starts to accumulate money.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.200
They drive asset prices up, and they

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.640
out-compete the working class for resources,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.360
and they drive the working class into debt.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.720
Stage two, the working class have run out of resources.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.880
They can no longer borrow anymore.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.280
They can no longer spend anymore.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.640
You get an economic depression and a crisis.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.520
That's when the government has to step in.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.720
Stage three, the government increasingly

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.320
runs out of resources as well.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.760
The government too becomes

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.360
massively in debt to the rich.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.040
That's when we enter stage four.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.640
The government has no choice but to

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.720
slowly eviscerate the middle class.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.680
Eventually, there is no wealth left other

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.840
than that held by the rich, and the physical

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.320
structure of your society changes such that

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.080
it only supports consumption for rich people.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.080
At this point, almost everybody in the

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.080
country lives in desperate poverty.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.840
Stage five, there are no weak

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.520
hands left to be squeezed out.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.760
The rich own everything, and the only way they

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.840
can try to grow their wealth is by sending

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.360
you to fight in their wars against each other.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.800
So another, characteristically

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.600
depressing video from Garys Economics.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.200
Listen, I wanna make it clear.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.840
Your grandparents fought for a better

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.040
settlement, and they got a better settlement.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.440
They lived in a world where there was desperate

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.920
widespread poverty,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.320
and they fought for

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.280
something better, and they got something better.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.080
They understood the only way

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.520
to do that was to tax the rich.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.240
We're campaigning on this

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.160
channel to tax wealth, not work.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.440
We are reaching out to the guys at Labour.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.360
We would love them to talk to us about policy.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.480
This will get worse.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.680
Until the government gets serious about taxing

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.200
the rich, there's basically nothing they can do.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.200
I'm gonna try to make them serious about it,

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.840
and your support is the only power that I have.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.680
So support the channel, share it with your friends,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.600
share with your family, send it to your mum,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.480
send it to Rachel Reeves, maybe she's interested.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.880
If you lose all your wealth, you lose all

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.920
your power, and you lose everything else.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.960
Stop the squeeze out.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.080
Take the wealth back.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.000
Tax wealth, not work.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.760
Thank you.
