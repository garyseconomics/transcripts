00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
central bank will print money and if the
 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
central bank will print money and if the
economy<00:07:29.919><c> is</c><00:07:30.000><c> strong</c><00:07:30.160><c> they'll</c><00:07:30.400><c> go</c><00:07:30.560><c> up</c><00:07:30.639><c> you</c><00:07:30.800><c> know</c>
