00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Today we are going to talk about passive income.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.240
Okay. So passive income

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.560
is a big sort of trend on the internet.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.200
The smart way to make money is to have passive income.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.840
Don't work for your money. Generate passive income.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.120
And I thought it would be nice to open up a little bit

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.320
and explain

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.360
what actually passive income

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.480
is from a broad economic perspective.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
So the first thing to say is

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.320
we live in an economy and most of us work,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920
and a lot of stuff is produced every year.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.080
A lot of goods and services are produced every year.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.480
When I work, when you work,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.280
we produce stuff, we make stuff.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.840
And every year that stuff is consumed

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.560
by different people in society.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.920
So some people consume an awful lot,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.360
spend a lot of money, consume

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720
a lot of goods and services, have a very luxurious life

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.000
and other people live very basic,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.640
barebones, essential lives

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760
where they live almost lives of poverty.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.840
So what is produced and who consumes it?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.160
Well, basically everything that is produced

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
every year is consumed by somebody.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.440
And some of it goes to workers.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.000
You know, you probably work a job

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.680
and you consume things.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.160
For example, you live in a house and you will eat food,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.840
and if you're lucky, you might get a holiday or two.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.560
You might go to the pub, you might go to a restaurant.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.720
Some of the stuff goes to workers, but a lot of people

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.920
get a lot of money that they don't work for.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.880
This is their passive income, and they get to consume

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.320
more, basically.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.640
And this passive income essentially

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.400
goes to the people who own the assets.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.440
So we talk a lot on this channel about what is wealth.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400
If you don't watch that video, I strongly recommend it.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.200
Most people never get to own

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.920
significant amounts of wealth

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.160
other than the house they live in.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.440
Most people are quite preoccupied

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.240
to own the house

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.200
they live in because it's very difficult to do,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.360
and they never get to own

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.560
a lot of the other forms of wealth

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.080
that exist in society.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.400
But there are huge amounts of wealth

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.320
assets involved in our economy

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.000
and the production of the things we produce.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800
So most obviously

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.200
there are the shops on the high street,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.920
there are the office blocks.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.120
There's a lot of skyscrapers here,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.480
office blocks people live in.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.760
There's also the natural resources.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.240
There's the supermarket,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.120
there's all of these buildings

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880
that are involved in producing things.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.720
There's factories, there's farms,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.080
and all of these are owned by somebody.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.240
And basically every year

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.040
the things we produce,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.560
some of it goes to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.960
people who work as payment for their work,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.480
and some of it goes to people who own

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.600
as payment for ownership. So

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.120
behind this concept of passive income

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.840
is basically the question of who owns our economy?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280
And whoever owns our economy,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.760
whoever owns our assets,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640
they will receive a massive chunk

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.920
of what we produce as a society each year.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.560
So here

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.280
we have the basic concept of passive income,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.480
and it's related to a video

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.720
we did a few weeks ago

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.800
saying that rent, interest

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.920
and profits are all the same thing,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.800
which is

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.640
there's a set of cash flows which go to owners

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.480
every single year.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.680
And these owners,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.800
they get cash flows from you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
and that's their passive income.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.240
But there is another type of passive income

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.280
which is very

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.080
heavily marketed, especially on things like TikTok,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.280
especially American TikTok,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.920
which is basically saying borrow a ton of money

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.760
buy assets, normally housing, and rent them out,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.080
and then you can make a passive income.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.440
So this is quite interesting, right?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.160
You're actually making a passive

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.920
income by borrowing money from the rich

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.160
so that you can buy assets

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.320
and then rent them out to poorer people.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.280
And I think this kind of exposes a little bit

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.400
how our economy works,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280
because here you have people who might themselves

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.320
not particularly be rich,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.440
who are basically paying

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.880
to, kind of,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.040
manage the assets of the very rich kind

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.920
of standing between the very rich and the rest of us.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.200
And if you look at these landlords,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.520
they're often themselves not extremely rich people,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.520
but they're essentially basically,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.000
they're working as estate agents for the rich.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120
And I think it kind of shows you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.040
the kind of society we've built

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.440
where really the rich own increasingly everything.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.280
And you basically get paid

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.960
based on your proximity to the rich.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.760
So, for example, I was working for a large bank

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.920
and I was basically managing

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.000
huge amounts of money for the rich,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.160
and I got paid a lot of money.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.400
And then I can pay people to work for me.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.840
In a sense,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.280
you're kind of recreating this kind of feudal system

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.800
with the rich own everything,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.120
and they pay a group below them to manage stuff

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.080
for them, who pay a group

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.800
below them to manage stuff for them.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.400
But it all comes down basically to the same point

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.560
that passive income is about who owns the resources.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.280
Which brings us to the question of is it possible

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.200
for everyone to get a passive income?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.760
Well, in a sense, yes,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.640
because these resources really exist.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.360
So there are some kinds of passive incomes

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.200
which are inherently zero sum in society.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.520
So for example, debt and debt interest.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.200
This is about who is in debt and who's in credit.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.440
It's payment from one person to another.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.120
But these resources they do really exist.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.320
You know,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.480
there is an enormous amount of productive capital.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.360
You know, there's a massive stock

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360
market out there which you could own some of.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.160
And they're all of these buildings and properties

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.560
which you could own somehow. So

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.920
I think in reality,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.200
the thing to realise is we live in a very rich country,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.320
in a very rich world with a lot of real resources,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.600
and you could own some of that.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.200
I think people sometimes see me

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.480
calling for taxation of the rich

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.280
and think that I'm

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.560
some kind of communist,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.360
but what I want is for you to own your own house

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.080
without a massive mortgage.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.240
And also I want you to own

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.840
a big chunk of the stock market.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.000
I want you to own

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.520
a big chunk of the farmland or the natural resources.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.720
I want you,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.680
the ordinary

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.240
working people of this country, Britain or whatever

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.800
country you’re in, to own the wealth of your country.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.280
And if you do that,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.600
then we can all have a passive income.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.560
We can all live lives like, you know,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.160
I am somebody who has a lot of wealth

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.040
and I live off my passive income.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040
And if I chose to stop working, I could stop working.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.520
I could live off of that.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.200
If we all had the passive income,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.960
then we wouldn't have to work so hard

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.640
because we own the properties we're in and we’d

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.240
own some of the wealth of our countries.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.800
And we’d live relatively comfortable lives.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.440
But if you look at what's actually happening

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.240
to the ownership of wealth,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.040
it's aggressively

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.640
being sucked away from the middle class.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.840
You can see that in terms

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.080
of reduced homeownership rates,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.560
much higher levels of mortgage debt,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.360
it's being pulled away from the government.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.400
You can see that in terms of government

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.640
loss of assets, privatisation of government assets

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.320
and the government falling into debt,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.240
and it's being held by the very rich.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.040
What that means is

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.160
you're losing a wealth, government's losing a wealth,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.400
and you are losing your passive income,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.240
and you end up in kind of this situation

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.400
of the opposite of passive income,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.320
which is not only do you not have a passive

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.160
income and ownership of the stock market,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.280
you don't even own enough

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.360
to live in a house and to eat food.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.480
You end up in a kind of

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.520
passive slavery as you will,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.400
which is you don't own anything

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.760
and you need to work your tits off

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.000
just to live in a house and eat food.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.480
So, passive income, it could be great.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.560
You know, we could all own

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.440
a fair share of the country we live in,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.680
and we could all live nice, comfortable lives where we

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.480
generate money just for getting out of bed

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.440
like Rishi Sunak does.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.600
And I'm not saying we could all stop working,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.080
but we could live much more comfortable lives.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.720
And the only way that would happen

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.360
is if you own the wealth.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.160
But the direction of travel, of wealth

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.960
is away from you and towards the rich,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.880
which means not only will

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.120
you not have a passive income,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.720
you will not have wealth.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.200
You will not even be able to,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.840
in many cases afford food, housing and energy.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.800
So the end message is passive

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.920
income is about wealth distribution.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.680
Passive income is about who owns the wealth.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.320
Do you own it or do the rich own it?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.200
If we get wealth into the hands of ordinary people,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.640
you can live a very comfortable life

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.080
just like the rich do now.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.080
If we push wealth in the other direction,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.200
like we are doing,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.880
then increasingly ordinary people will struggle

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.360
to feed their kids and turn the heating on.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.000
So passive income, it's great.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.360
The only way to do it is to get wealth into your hands.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.440
The only way to get wealth into your hands

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.600
is to significantly increase taxation on the rich,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.680
because they've got it,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.880
and they're not going to give it to you any other way.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.520
So passive income, let's get it.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440
Let's take the wealth back.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.520
Let's live in a more equal country

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.200
where people can live good lives.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.880
I'm going to push through it on this channel.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.840
Keep supporting.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.160
Tell your friends, tell your mum. Take care.
