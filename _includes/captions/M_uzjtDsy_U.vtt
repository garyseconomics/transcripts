00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.800
Welcome back to Gary's economics, today we're going&nbsp;
to talk about economic predictions in the media

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.320
okay so we started this channel two years&nbsp;
ago and the very first thing we did was did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
a video about Covid predicting how it&nbsp;
was going to affect the economy and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
that video we said that a huge amount of&nbsp;
money would be given from the governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.200
to the rich that would cause a huge increase&nbsp;
in inequality a huge increase in house prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.960
a huge increase in inflation and basically&nbsp;
a cost of living crisis for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
so here we are two years later and we can see all&nbsp;
of that stuff has happened and the question that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.280
it raises is if all those predictions were right then&nbsp;
why is nobody in the media talking now about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
so much money has been transferred from the&nbsp;
government to the rich and the super rich and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.240
this raises really interesting questions about&nbsp;
making predictions in economics and in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.280
so back when I was a trader there was a very very&nbsp;
heavy incentivization to be to be right and I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.200
a very good track record as a trader and I made&nbsp;
some predictions that were right and within two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.160
three years of me starting working as a trader&nbsp;
I became pretty famous and pretty well known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160
and very well paid in that industry because I was&nbsp;
making predictions that were consistently correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.960
um but now in the media you know at the beginning&nbsp;
of Covid I was because my background was trading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
I tried really hard to make a lot of clear&nbsp;
predictions about what was going to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.800
because I feel like a lot of people in the media&nbsp;
just say whatever they like and they're not really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.520
very clear about what they actually believe so&nbsp;
I made a lot of clear predictions that if you go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.280
back and read my early articles for 'Open Democracy'&nbsp;
or watch my first video on this channel you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.240
see that those predictions all came correct now&nbsp;
at the same time 'The Guardian' which is obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.720
a massive newspaper their Chief economics&nbsp;
correspondent Larry Elliott wrote an article&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.480
saying that Covid is going to make house prices&nbsp;
collapse now we can obviously see in hindsight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.280
that his prediction was wrong and we can see&nbsp;
in hindsight that my predictions were right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.920
but what punishment is there for Larry&nbsp;
Elliott of the Guardian for being wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.880
and what reward is there for me being right&nbsp;
well really there's none basically because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
media is not like trading if you're a trader and&nbsp;
you're right all the time you get paid a million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.640
pound; if you're a trader and you're wrong all&nbsp;
the time you get fired. If you're in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.200
and you're right, a year later nobody remembers&nbsp;
and if you're in the media and you're wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.640
a year later nobody remembers. Now the problem&nbsp;
with this is it creates a situation where if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.840
you are a really good Economist and you keep&nbsp;
making correct predictions the media will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.520
generally push you to the front and if you are an&nbsp;
economist who works in the media and you're bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.520
and you make very bad predictions nobody's ever&nbsp;
going to call you out so what this means is if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.640
you are a really good Economist and you want to&nbsp;
explain to people what's happening in the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.040
how do you do it how does the media determine who&nbsp;
gets the important jobs and and who gets ignored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.720
well if you don't have a system that actively&nbsp;
finds the good people and actively discourages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.600
the bad people basically you're going to end up&nbsp;
with the people who know the right people getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.600
into the best jobs, you're going to end up in a&nbsp;
situation where it kind of becomes a posh Boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.800
club where everybody went to the same school and&nbsp;
everybody knows each other because that's the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.360
way to get in so if you're a really good Economist&nbsp;
you turn up on the trading floor, you're right year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.600
after year, within a year you'll be famous you do&nbsp;
that in the media you probably won't get noticed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.520
and it creates this problem where very good&nbsp;
economists can be very well rewarded in financing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.280
and trading but they'll generally be ignored in&nbsp;
the media and it will be the same in government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.640
what this means is the people who are&nbsp;
supposed to be protecting our economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.800
economists in academia, in journalism,&nbsp;
in government, in central banking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.760
basically have no incentivization to actually&nbsp;
be correct; nobody ever goes back and checks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.520
hindsight their homework the end result is most&nbsp;
of these guys chat nonsense most of the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.440
um if that's the situation that you have you can't&nbsp;
really be surprised when the economy that we end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.440
up with is very weak. So what I would suggest&nbsp;is
that economists who are in very powerful positions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.640
like for example working at the Bank of England&nbsp;
or senior professors at Oxford or senior jobs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.720
in the media, I think they should be forced to&nbsp;
make predictions and you know those predictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.120
can say look if this happens then that will&nbsp;
happen if that happens then this will happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.520
but if they're not forced to make predictions then&nbsp;
there's no way we have of no one who's good and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.920
who's bad so I think we should force them to make&nbsp;
predictions and then go back in hindsight and see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.840
who was right and who was wrong and that will give&nbsp;
us an opportunity to find the best economists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.200
put them into the best positions because as it is&nbsp;
at the moment we've pretty much got a situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.320
where anyone who's a really good Economist is&nbsp;
going to go and work in the city; and journalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.680
and central banking end up being a posh boys&nbsp;
club and that's not good for society okay enjoy
