00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.280
Today we are going to explain compound interest.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.520
Okay.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.120
So compound

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.360
interest is a very popular topic on social media,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.720
especially the financial influencer space.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.760
Famously, Albert Einstein is

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.200
said to have called compound

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.680
interest the most powerful force in the universe.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.480
He probably didn't really say that.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.880
What else

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.400
are you misunderstanding about compound interest?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.560
Okay, we should probably start

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.240
with a very clear explanation

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.280
of what compound interest is, why it's so popular,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.200
and why it's a big deal,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.360
why Albert Einstein allegedly

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.680
thought it was so important.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.360
So the big thing about compound interest is that it

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.480
grows in what mathematicians

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.280
would call an exponential fashion.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.400
And we're going to show you

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.960
how that works very quickly

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.840
in a very simple explanation.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.600
So let's assume you have a really good investment

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560
and you're able to make 10% a year,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.680
which is a very high rate of return.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.800
Let's say you start with £1,000.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.360
In your first year

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
you will get given £100

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.960
in interest, let's say puts you to £1100.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
But in the next year, since you not only get 10%

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.480
on your initial £1000, but also this £100, you end up

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.520
seeing your £1100 go up by not just £100,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.440
but £110, which is of course more,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.120
which means you end up with £1210 and this process

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.400
increases each time.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.600
So next time you...

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
this goes up by 110 plus another 11.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.040
So you end up getting 121.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.920
And just this just keeps happening basically.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.800
Every single year,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320
not only does your investment go up,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.640
but your growth increases as well.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
What this means is because the growth each year

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.200
is increasing,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.160
it means that if we imagine your wealth

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.600
over time, so here's how old you are.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480
Here's how rich you are.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.560
It doesn't just go up in a straight line

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.000
like this dotted line.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.040
It actually goes up in this curve exponential way,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.280
which kind of curves upwards, you know, to the moon,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.560
some would like to say.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.720
And this is the reason why

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.800
compound interest is so appealing.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.600
It gives the sense

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.880
that if we just save enough year

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.800
after year,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.880
we'll grow more and more and more

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.680
and our wealth will shoot upwards towards the moon.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.160
And this is the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
reason why compound interest is so popular, basically.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.600
And it's super,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.800
super attractive and it's super compelling.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.240
And this is why a lot of financial influencers

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.880
will say,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.800
save your money year after year,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.640
build up your compounding interest.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.520
We can all see our savings go to the moon

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.120
and we can all be spectacularly rich.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.160
That is the power of compound interest.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.120
And behind this is an idea about society

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.080
and an idea about the economy, which is basically true.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.080
So why is it that you can make these kind

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.640
of growing returns year after year?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.720
What is happening

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.320
in theory, in the economy

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.320
that allows these exponential, rapidly growing returns?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.360
This idea is probably best explained by imagining,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.120
and economists love to do this,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.520
and I think it's often quite unrealistic,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
imagining your sort of desert island economy.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.720
So you arrive on a desert island.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.840
There's nothing there.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.640
You know, you're struggling to survive.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640
What do you do?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.240
Well,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.240
the first thing you need to do is you take care of your

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.040
food supply. So you, you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
build a kind of farm in your first year.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.680
And then because you've set up

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.800
the sort of basics of a farm, that means that next year

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.280
you have more food,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.440
which means you have an extra bit of time

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.920
which you can use to build a better house,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.840
and you can use to build better tools.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.760
And then each year,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.720
because you're improving your productive capacity

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.800
every single year,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.680
you have a bit more free time and a bit more resources,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.240
which you can

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.320
then use to build

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.320
your productive capacity again and again and again.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.440
So the kind of compound interest that we are seeing

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.520
from an individual

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.200
perspective is mirrored

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.080
by this kind of compounding returns in society.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.360
Because each year

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.720
as you build things up, you have more resources,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.640
and you can use those extra resources

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.800
to build more resources again.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.720
And that is why the compound interest

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720
that we see as individuals when we save

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.240
can also be mirrored in ideas such as economic growth,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.640
because each year you have more resources.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.600
If you put those extra resources in as well,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320
you can grow even faster each successive year.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.640
And these ideas, these ideas about compound interest,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.280
they're really, really appealing

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.240
to a certain kind of person.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.440
And to be honest,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.920
I am that certain kind of person, this kind of non

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.920
busy shopkeepery person that likes this idea,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.320
if I work hard every year,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.040
if I save a bit

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.440
every year, I can get more

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440
and then the growth will grow

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.800
and then the growth will grow on top of that.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.040
And eventually if I just work hard every year

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.160
and save every year, I'll get richer.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.600
And in the long run, I'll be rich.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.680
It's a super compelling

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.640
and it's a super appealing idea.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.120
There's only one problem with that idea,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.640
it doesn't work.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.800
And what I'm going to explain in

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.400
this video

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
is why it doesn't really work for individuals,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.320
and why it doesn't really work for society.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.680
So I think you should be able to see relatively quickly

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.920
when it doesn't work

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.640
for individuals,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.760
by simply comparing the story of compound interest

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.040
with the reality of economic life in our society.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.360
So you see this graph that I drew for you,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
you have compound interest

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.440
just going up and up and up to the moon.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.360
It gives this kind of implication

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880
that as long as you save every year,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.320
as long as you wait long enough,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.880
you'll get richer and richer and richer

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.880
and richer, and by the end you'll be a millionaire.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.520
The big question I have is,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.080
I think,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.360
probably the big tell,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.320
that this doesn't really work like this.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.320
If it's so easy to become a millionaire,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.440
why is such a small minority of people

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.480
actually millionaires?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.400
Is it because they're lazy?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.520
Is it because they're not saving?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.440
Is it because they're spending too much money?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.400
Or is the reality

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.440
a little bit more complicated than that?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.840
So the big reason why this idea

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.240
of continually compounding returns doesn't work

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.200
is because it ignores what economists would call

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.960
the life cycle nature of savings.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.640
So most people only work for a period of their lives.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.600
Most people

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.880
increasingly nowadays study up until they're 21,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400
and they hope to retire when they're sort of 60, 65,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.720
and they work for this 45 year period.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.440
This means that you can't do this

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.640
saving and compounding for your whole life.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.640
You have two periods, one at the beginning

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.720
and one at the end,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.280
where you're not working.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.840
And during those periods where you're not working,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.840
what is happening to your compounding?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.320
Well, essentially, it's working in reverse.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.960
When you’re young and you're a student, you're not...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.440
you're not earning any money

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.000
and you're having to pay to go to university.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.080
And when you are old and you're retired,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.160
you're also not earning any money.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
And you increasingly have really

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.880
pretty large running costs

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880
in terms of paying your bills, paying for your,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.760
just your regular needs.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.440
But as you get older, increasingly

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.440
a lot of people are having to spend a lot of money on

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.560
caring as they get old and end of life care.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.640
That basically means that the actual graph of wealth

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.200
over time looks quite different.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.960
So let's draw that graph again.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.480
Here's how rich you are.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.640
Here's your age.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.200
What does it really look like?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.240
Well, first of all, you don't start at zero.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.520
You start down here.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520
You've got to pay off your mortgage,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.560
you've got to pay of your student debts.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.400
Then you start saving.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.280
Well things happen.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280
You have your first kid.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.440
That definitely cost you a bit.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.000
You have your second kid.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.440
Now you're making a bit more because you're old.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.400
Now you retire. Well, what happens when you retire?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.480
Suddenly you start needing this money

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.040
to get you through your retirement.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.920
You start to get sick.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.840
You need a carer.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.880
You need to be in a home.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.200
And by the time you die,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.120
most people are back around zero.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.600
And this is what happened to my grandparents.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.560
They all owned property when they were alive.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:13.760
They’d

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.680
all basically lost

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.800
all of that wealth by the time they died

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.360
because while you might have thought

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.680
you were saving up and going to the moon,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.720
what most people are actually

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.480
doing is just saving up enough

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.600
to survive their retirement.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.280
So if I look at my family

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.320
and I think this is very common

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.560
for British families or families overseas,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.720
all of my grandparents

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.280
actually were able to own property

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.720
at some point in time.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.680
But because they incurred

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.160
so many costs in their later

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.520
life, paying for their time

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.280
and paying for their end of life care,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760
they basically ended up dying with nothing.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.920
So what you think you are seeing as compound growth

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.040
is actually really just

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.200
what we would call as economists,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.600
the life cycle saving.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.120
And you

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.040
as a family are not really accumulating

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.320
anything over time.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320
And the second reason

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.480
why it doesn't really work

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.640
for individuals is quite simply, increasingly

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.840
for a big chunk, maybe even a majority of workers.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.400
They're quite simply is almost nothing left over

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.400
after paying your regular cost of living.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.840
As rents,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.560
energy and food get more expensive and wages

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.720
don't keep up,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.640
more and more people are ending up in a situation

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.000
where basically they have nothing left to save.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.080
And this is a double problem, right,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.960
because firstly,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.280
if you can't save anything,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.720
you can't get these compounding interests.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.520
And secondly,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.040
once you understand the previous point

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.560
about life cycle saving,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.560
you realise that you need

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.880
this accumulated compound interest

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.720
that you've accumulated over the course of your life

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.400
to pay for your retirement.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.240
So what we have is a situation now.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.680
Many working people can't

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.200
afford to accumulate these compound interest at all

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.520
because they can't save.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.520
And that means that their retirements are increasingly

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.720
completely unfunded, which is a big problem.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.360
But how does that map in to this idea,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.240
which I introduced at the beginning,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.920
which is the reason that individuals

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.960
can compound their interest and get growth upon growth,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.120
upon growth,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.760
is because society can compound its interest

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.640
and getting growth upon

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.400
growth, upon growth, by building more and more

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.240
and more productive capacity year

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.520
after year, and creating more production

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.760
and more free time to continually compound

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.440
growth as a society.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.120
If societies can grow in a compounding way forever,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.440
why can't individuals

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.440
grow in a compounding way forever?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.040
And once again,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.760
we can realise this difference between the theory

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.640
and the reality by basically

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.480
looking at what's happening in real life.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.840
Which is just like in the individual case,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.600
the theory tells us compound

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.520
interest can make us all rich over time

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.160
and yet in reality, very, very few people

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.320
ever do become

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.160
even millionaires, never mind billionaires.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.040
The theory tells us that

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.000
economic growth can compound forever

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.400
in an economy, in a society,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.120
we can make increasingly richer economies,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.480
and yet we increasingly live in economies

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.720
which struggle to get even 1% economic growth.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240
Why is that?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.240
And the reason for this is basically that we live

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.320
in economies that have

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.920
physical limits.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.920
And I think the clue in a way, should have been

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.640
that the example which we used to introduce

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.200
to the idea of

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.200
compounding societal growth was a desert island.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.800
Well, what are the key features of a desert island?

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.320
The key feature of a desert island

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.880
is that it's completely uninhabited, completely wild.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.240
There's a tonne of natural resources,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.280
and nothing is built on that island.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.680
Now, if you land on an island like that,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.880
especially if it's a large

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.880
island with tonnes of natural resources,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.080
you really can grow as a society in a compounding way

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.680
because there's this enormous island

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.200
for you to expand into, and you can build up

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.320
one area of the island,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.480
you can industrialise one area of the island.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.000
You can use the tools that you can build in that area

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.280
to expand to the next area

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.480
and to expand to the next area,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.720
and to expand to the next area

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.520
and to expand to the next area.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.680
The problem you have

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.880
is that eventually

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.840
you will get to the other side of the island,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.200
and you will have nowhere to expand into.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.320
So what do you do when your model is

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.320
built on rapidly expanding growth

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.480
and you hit the end of your island?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.280
Well, this causes a problem, right?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.000
Because we have individuals in society

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.200
and we have individuals in our society

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.040
who are extremely wealthy.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.920
They own much of the natural resources.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.160
They also have a lot of productive equipment,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.400
like they might have factories,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.680
or they might have farms or they might have mines.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.400
And these guys will see their wealth grow

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.080
at about 4%, 5% a year.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.680
And that's not really a problem

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.560
when you live in these infinite societies,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.280
because I can own this part of the country

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.080
and I can grow it,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.760
and I can grow it, and I can grow it,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.320
and you guys can just keep moving out to new

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.520
parts of this island.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.840
The problem happens is when you get to the end.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.240
I'm going to keep growing

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.640
and you guys are going to have nowhere to go.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.680
And what happens in that situation?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.200
Well, in that situation, what you will often see

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.760
is the economic growth

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.400
of the whole society will fall significantly.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.080
Just like now we are, I'm talking to you from the UK,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.480
which is a very old economy, it's

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.000
a very industrialised economy,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.200
it industrialised a long time ago.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.720
Pretty much

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.480
all of the island is owned,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.920
pretty much all of the island is used.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.320
There's not really anywhere in Great Britain

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.040
where you can go

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.240
and live

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.160
off of the land,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.120
because all of the land is owned and used and

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.120
that means it's not

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.040
super easy and super obvious to grow,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.360
because you have this question of where do you grow to?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.400
Where do you grow into?

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.840
That means that the growth of the country

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.560
has dropped down to only 1% now,

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.240
and yet growth of the wealth of the rich

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.600
is still around about 5% kind of level.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.640
And this is the key difference,

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.560
which I really want you to understand.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.560
Economic growth in the UK is 1%.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.600
Even in bigger countries

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.600
like the US, it's 3% where they have more growth.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.960
The rich are growing their wealth at 5%.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.440
This is a lot bigger.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.640
5% is a lot more.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.360
So if the rich are growing at 5%,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.360
the economies are growing at 3% or maybe even 1%.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.840
Where is this wealth coming from?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.040
Because I think it's very tempting

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.400
when we

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.000
look at growing wealth of individuals,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.160
growing wealth of individuals to think, well,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.440
this individual is a very productive individual.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.440
He's creating more productive things for our society.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.440
He's helping our society grow.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.600
But I don't think that actually maps

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.160
onto the

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
real lived situation of being a wealthy person.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.800
So I am a moderately wealthy person.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.480
I'm not a billionaire.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.320
I'm not Elon Musk,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.720
but I'm rich enough

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.280
that I can live off of my passive income,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.920
which basically means

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.920
I can live off the income of the wealth that I own.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.360
And when I made that wealth,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.360
which is in my sort of early to mid 20s,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480
I had a lot of choices about what investments

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.000
I was going to make.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.040
And at that point, I realised that not

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.040
all investments are about creating

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.960
new productive capital or

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.200
creating new productive machinery.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.920
You have an alternative option as well,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.080
which is you can buy existing investments

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.360
or you can lend money to other people,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.200
put other people into debt, essentially.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.040
And I made the variety of investments,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.760
I did invest into productive companies

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.320
that were trying to make productive stuff.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.400
And I also invested

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.720
into just buying a lot of existing assets.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.960
I bought stocks, I bought property,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.680
I bought gold, I did a bit of both things

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.080
now because I made that money

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.680
in the early 2010s, when it was a very weak economy.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.800
Most of the productive investments

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.960
that I invested in basically failed,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.000
and they failed because

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.920
essentially there was a very weak consumer.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.080
You know,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.760
I invested in some restaurant

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.400
chains and things like this,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.400
and there were no customers, so these things failed.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.680
But the investments I made or I simply bought existing

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.520
assets, bought existing

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.760
stocks, bought existing properties,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.960
bought existing

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.240
gold, these investments all did really, really well.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.640
And I think this thing that happened to me,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.320
where I made a lot of money

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.120
and I tried to grow the economy and basically failed

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.040
and discovered

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.040
that what works is buying existing assets,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.200
shows you exactly the problem with compounding interest

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.960
in finite economies in finite countries

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.080
on a finite planet.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.560
If you

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.040
allow the rich to grow

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.800
and grow and grow and grow and grow,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.800
once you hit your natural limits,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.440
the rich will continue to grow by

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.040
basically cannibalising the existing middle class.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.960
And that's not because they're evil,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.480
it's simply

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.160
because their wealth is so large and grows so quickly,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.120
and there are so few actual

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.840
real investment opportunities

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.080
that basically they have no other option.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.480
And if you think about it,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.640
this is also why it can't work for the individual.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.280
You know, it's...

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.400
we live in a finite country.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.840
We live on a finite planet.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.240
There's only so much you can grow by expanding

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.800
and expanding and expanding.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.160
Eventually you reach your limits,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.520
and once you reach those limits, what used to be

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.600
a kind of everybody wins game where we expand,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.040
we expand,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.800
we grow

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.800
becomes a competition for the existing resources.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.160
The rich will bid up the natural resources.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.800
They will increasingly buy

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.440
and own the natural resources,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.520
they will increasingly monopolise

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.560
important societal resources,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.880
like not just like farmland,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.360
but also we're obviously seeing

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.720
the rich monopolising things

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.560
like ownership of social media,

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.200
ownership of physical media,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.200
ownership of productive machinery, things like this.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.640
And over time,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.840
they will simply squeeze the middle class out.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.040
And you kind of reach this,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.640
I suppose, what some people call late stage

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.080
capitalism, where we've already expanded a lot.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.080
There's not a lot of obvious space to expand into.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.360
Everything is owned,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.400
and suddenly it starts to be a competition

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.040
for who is going to own the existing resources.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.160
And that is a problem, because if you reach that point

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.880
and you have a small amount of people

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.440
who are extraordinarily rich,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.720
it will be very easy for them to outcompete

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.720
the weaker players for those existing resources.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.640
And that is what we're basically seeing now.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.680
We are seeing the very rich growing their wealth at 5%,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.040
while the economy grows at just 1%.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.720
And the way that that is happening is essentially

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.920
the rich are eating your cake,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.440
the rich are taking your assets.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.040
And this is why the assets that you own

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.680
will not be owned by your kids,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.480
will not be owned by your grandkids.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.320
It is why your kids and grandkids will probably own

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.680
nothing and be extremely poor

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.240
and probably quite unhappy.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.800
This is what happens when you allow compound interest.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.800
The rich eventually eat the middle class.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.520
And I think one thing

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.760
that is interesting about this dynamic is

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.360
what you first see when it first starts happening,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.360
when the rich start struggling to actually expand

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.960
and start

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960
instead focusing on buying the existing resources.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.800
The first thing that you see when that happens is

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.800
asset prices, existing asset prices start to rise.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.200
At most people...

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.800
for most people,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.520
the most visible asset price is housing.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.120
So they all see the house price rise.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.280
But it won't just be house price.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.160
You also see

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.880
land prices

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.160
going up, stock prices going

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.880
up, the gold price going up.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.440
Even things like classic cars and classic art,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.360
all of these asset prices will rise.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.320
And what you are seeing

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.440
there is kind of the dispossession

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.080
of the middle class

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.480
and the driving of the middle class into poverty.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.760
But because these middle class people own assets,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.120
they very often

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.840
see those asset prices rising and think, this is good,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.600
we're getting rich.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.040
And really, what I want to do in this video is ring

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.240
the alarm bell and say,

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.320
when you see those asset prices rising,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.200
that is not you getting rich.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.200
That is your class, your group of people,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.320
ordinary families losing your assets.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.240
And it is your kids and your grandkids

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.360
being driven into poverty.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.720
I'm always reminded when I see, you know,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.280
ordinary people

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.200
happy about house price rises of, a Bible story,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.360
trying to get more Bible stories into these videos.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.920
There's a story in the Old Testament

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.680
about two sons, called Esau and Jacob.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.440
Esau is the eldest son,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.960
so he's the person who should inherit the,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.800
the land of the father

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.320
according to the rules at the time.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.160
He's a big, strong guy,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.280
likes to go hunting, but he's a bit stupid.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:50.720
He goes out

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.640
hunting one day,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.400
he gets lost,

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.680
he comes back late and he’s starving hungry.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.480
And his younger brother

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.920
Jacob says to him, “Listen, I can see you’re hungry,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.120
I'll give you this little bowl of food that I've made.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.160
If you give me your inheritance.”

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.160
And the older son says,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.440
“Well, I'm not going to get my inheritance

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.080
for another 40, 50 years, like, f**k that,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.840
that's a long time away.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.600
I'm hungry, give me the food.”

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.840
And the end result is

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.240
that Esau kids and Esau's grandkids will be poor.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.840
That is what is happening now.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.520
That is what is happening now.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.880
The rapid compound interest growth of the very rich

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.000
is driving

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.320
your family out of the ability to own assets.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.360
That means in the long run,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.280
not just your kids and your grandkids,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.160
but your whole community

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160
will not own assets in 40, 50, 60 years.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.040
That means you will have no middle class.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.720
If you have no middle class, then

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.200
you have nobody to drive spending.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.080
You have nobody to drive economic growth.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.320
And if you want to see what a country looks like

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.920
when it has a very small middle class,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.360
you can see that, go to India, go to Brazil,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.400
go to Johannesburg in South Africa, countries

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.280
with no middle class

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.240
generally provide

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.200
extremely low quality

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200
of economic life for ordinary people.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.240
And if you think that can't happen in this country,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.640
go read

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.320
Charles Dickens

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.920
because it happened here 100 years ago

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.560
and it can easily happen again.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.120
So to conclude,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.320
compound interest,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.080
it feels like a route out of poverty for everyone.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.880
In reality,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.120
it is the exact way

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.320
that the rich outbid you and your kids for resources.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.880
Compound interest will lead to the rich

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.480
eating the middle class and poverty

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.280
for your kids and grandkids.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.960
The only way to fix this is to change the tax system,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.880
to stop taxing ordinary people

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.920
so much, and tax the super rich more.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.520
If we do that, we can improve economic conditions.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.800
If we don't do that, there will be poverty.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.880
More and more poverty in this country.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.880
Fight back, change the tax system, reduce inequality.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.200
It's the only way to avoid poverty.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
Thank you for your support.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.640
Send this to your friends, send it to your mum.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.080
Take care.
