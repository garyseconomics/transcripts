00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.680
Okay, today is
Tuesday the 5th of March.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
And today's the day
that my book The Trading

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.200
Game is being released.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.040
So you probably
will have seen by now.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
I've done about
a million interviews

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.240
for every newspaper

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.600
in the world
on this book.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.240
And it's been crazy.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.240
Everybody's
recognising me

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040
in the street,
and we're getting

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.600
tons of new viewers
on the channel.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.120
The main thing that
I want to say today is

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
we've sold
a lot of these books.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
And what is starting
to become clear

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.920
is that we have a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.760
pretty good chance
of coming out

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.160
week one as number one
nonfiction book

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.280
in the whole country,
which is crazy.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.040
We don't know for sure
that's going to happen.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.800
Basically, if
we come in at number one,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.960
then everyone
will see that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.000
this is the number one
nonfiction

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.160
book in the country,
and it will be number one

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.320
on the shelves in every
bookshop in the country.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.280
And we are going to sell
a ton more books

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.480
and a ton
more people are going

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.680
to find out
about this work.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.280
And a ton more people

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.560
are going to find out
about this channel.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.680
I don't like to do
‘buy my book buy my book’

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.720
videos,
but books sold between

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440
now and Saturday,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
including Saturday
will count towards

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.920
the charts basically.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
So if you are thinking
about buying the book,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
please buy it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.040
between now and Saturday,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.120
because it will help us
be number one

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.200
book in the country
and that would be

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.400
an amazing achievement
for me and for everyone

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.560
who has supported
the channel

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.480
and who follows
the channel,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.240
and it will really
help us to grow. So

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.480
yeah, I don’t like doing
'buy my book’ stuff,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.600
but the book is out
today.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280
I’ve put a lot of my heart
and soul into this book.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.560
I think it's really good.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.560
The reviews
are coming in.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.960
Good people
seem to like it, and I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.680
hope you’ll like it.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.160
And if you're going
to buy it,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840
please buy
the physical copies

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120
is what counts towards
the charts.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.080
I know
some of you are going

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.160
to buy the audible
or the online book but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.520
if you are interested

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520
in physical books
and you can buy

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.800
between now and Saturday.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Please do it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.320
and keep
an eye on the charts

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.520
and hopefully we’ll be
the number one

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.280
book in
the whole country.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040
So thank you
for your support

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.240
and let's
see how we do. Thank you.
