00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.560
Today we're going to talk about investment.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.960
This is building on some stuff

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.120
we've been talking about about growth.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640
And there's a question about, okay

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.600
how do you get growth?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.880
You need to invest, invest to build your economy.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.040
Invest, invest, invest. Let's grow.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.640
And I think it's important to understand

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.040
how does investment work.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.400
Because I think there's a very simplistic

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.760
understanding of investment,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
which is if you want to invest,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.880
you need to give loads of money to rich people,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520
because who does investments?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.200
Rich people,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.920
if you give loads of money to rich people,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.040
we’ll get investments and we’ll grow.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120
If you look at the last 20, 30 years

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.880
when the wealth of the rich

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.920
has grown really significantly, investment

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.120
has actually fallen in many countries,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.640
especially here in the UK.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.160
So why is it that when you give money to rich people,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.200
it doesn't necessarily lead to investment?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.720
But the first thing I would say is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.400
when a rich person invests,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.560
it doesn't necessarily lead to the creation

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.800
of new productive capacity.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.360
So for example, if I make £2 million

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.560
and I use it to buy all your mum's houses,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.440
it doesn't really do much to improve the economy.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
So rich people can simply invest by buying your assets.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.240
And this leads us to thinking

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.960
and a little bit

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480
of a more nuanced way about investment.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.120
And for me,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.800
when you want to create investment

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.600
to create new productive capacity,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.040
there's basically two things you need.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.480
Yes, you do need somebody

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.760
to basically fund that investment,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.520
which is basically I'm going to use the resources

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640
that I have to create something new,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.520
to build something new, to build a new factory,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
to build a new windmill,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.000
to build the new diamond mine,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.680
whatever, to build the new office block.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.280
You need somebody

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.400
to say, I'm going to provide the resources

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.240
and in a modern society,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.320
which is very unequal, that is often the rich.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.440
But, you know, when you look back at the postwar period

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.760
when investment was much higher,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.240
it could be government or it could

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.880
be, you know, a group of ordinarily non

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.960
super wealthy people putting their resources

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.400
towards building new things.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.600
But it doesn't just require

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.680
people to fund the investment.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.440
You also need profitable investments to exist.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.640
So I have been

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.440
essentially retired ten years ago.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.280
And since then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.120
I've basically been living off my investments

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.800
and so I guess you could say I'm

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.760
a professional investor in a way,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.200
although I think that's probably

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.240
a little bit of an excessive

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.800
fancy word to say, A rich person.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.760
In that course of time,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.200
I've done loads of different investments

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.480
and some of them were like productive investments.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.040
Let's build something, that's create

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.880
something new in the economy.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.920
And some of them were,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.720
you know, I'm just going to buy existing assets.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.680
I'm going to buy the stock market, I'm going to buy

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.120
gold, I'm going to buy a property.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.960
And in the course of those ten years as an investor,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.320
almost all of the times I tried to invest in actually

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.680
building new

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.720
productive capacity,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.560
increasing the size of the economy.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.240
I lost money, basically,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.280
those investments almost all failed.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.160
And almost every single time

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.800
I just bought stuff that already existed,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.760
I made a ton of money.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.200
The most profitable investment I ever did

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.160
was probably buying a ton of gold

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.240
at the beginning of Covid.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.040
I made an absolute fortune on that. And,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600
I think it's pretty clear that me buying

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600
a ton of gold does nothing to help grow the economy.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.880
And this raises the question of

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.120
why is it that trying to build new stuff

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520
is not profitable,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.160
but buying existing stuff is profitable?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.520
And I think that is because essentially,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.160
to make a productive investment,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.080
a profitable investment, you need a customer.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.680
At the end of the day it's not enough

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
just for rich people like me to turn up and say,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.760
here's the money.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.320
You also need businesses to say, well,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.320
we know that there's a massive customer base out there,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.640
so we want to build new stuff for these people.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.360
And I think the story of the last 20, 30 years

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120
is basically the impoverishment of the middle class

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.440
and the ordinary British family,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560
the ordinary American family, European family,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.960
Australian family, whoever you are,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.560
at the expense of the very rich.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.440
And that is why

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.400
trying to grow the economy has basically failed.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.480
And if you look at this,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.440
the parts of the economy

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.880
that have grown a lot,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
it's almost exclusively

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.720
luxury stuff and services for the rich.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.800
So I think

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.960
this sort of drive towards growth and investment

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.040
will not work

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.440
unless you deal with the fundamental inequality

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.840
that exists in our society.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.760
And that is because

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.840
no matter how much money you give to the rich,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.600
when they go to businesses and say, here's

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.640
the money, businesses are going to look and say,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.320
well, where is the customer?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.000
And if the only people they see

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.680
who are accumulating

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.520
a ton of money are very rich people,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.600
even if we do build new productive capacity,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.360
the only stuff they're going to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.560
create is super luxury,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.360
expensive stuff that you can't afford

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.480
that is for the rich,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.800
because these guys have the money.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.080
And I think what you need to understand is

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.800
a capitalist economy is very flexible.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.160
It will provide stuff

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.400
specifically for people who have money.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.680
You know,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.840
I often think, you know,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.120
since I started this YouTube channel, people like to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.440
tell you go and be like Mr. Beast.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.920
For those of you who don't know, Mr. Beast is,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.680
I think, the most biggest, most watched YouTuber ever.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.680
And he does a lot of stuff, like he goes to Africa

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.440
and he pays for like cheap

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.680
eye surgery for people in sub-Saharan

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.680
Africa, in poor communities

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.360
and these are very cheap surgeries

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.560
that provide extraordinarily, phenomenally

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.360
significant improvements

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.400
in life for people in poor communities.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400
So if you think from an investment perspective

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.080
like this should be what we're investing in right?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.680
Here are people who,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.040
you don't need to put a lot of money in,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.280
and you can really significantly

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.280
improve their quality of life.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.240
So why don't we do that?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.520
Why does capitalism, why do businesses,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.840
not build healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.960
The answer is quite simply

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.440
because sub-Saharan Africans are poor

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.600
and capitalism

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.920
does not provide investment for poor people

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.040
because they want it to be profitable.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.840
And the reason you should be worried about

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720
this is because in the West, in the UK,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.960
US, Europe, Australia, increasingly

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.120
ordinary people are poor.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.080
You are poor. Your future is poor.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.800
So if you want growth, if you want investment,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.880
you're not going to get it.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.280
Unless you deal with the fundamental fact

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.480
that you are poor,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.080
you need to deal with the distribution.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.000
Listen,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.840
capitalism has for a long time not provided

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.600
anything for people in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.280
People in lots of Latin America, People in lots of Asia

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.720
because they were poor people.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.920
And it was easy for

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.360
people like us not to worry about it

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.680
because we were the comfortable middle class.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.920
Now we are poor. The average British person is poor.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.120
The only way to get things

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.280
is to change the distribution.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.760
If you don't change the distribution,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.120
then all of that new investment

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.280
will be luxury

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.600
consumption, luxury properties, luxury holidays

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.960
for the rich and that is not going to help you at all.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.120
So this relates to the videos

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.680
you've been doing

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.160
about the stupidity of growth,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.960
which is if you focus only on growth

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.040
without focusing on distribution,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.920
all you do is keep running

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.480
towards slavery at a faster rate.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.280
Listen, there's a fundamental imbalance of power

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.160
and resources.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.960
You are in a competition with the rich for resources.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.040
If we're going to invest in this unequal system,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.960
businesses will have a choice.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.200
Are we going to build

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.480
healthcare centers in sub-Saharan Africa?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.280
Are we going to build affordable homes

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040
for poor people in the UK,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.960
or are we going to build a sixth

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.560
helipad on the top of Elon Musk's f**king skyscraper?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.560
You are going to lose that competition.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.560
As the rich get richer and richer,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.080
they will take the resources

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.960
and the investment that you need,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.640
and the economy will turn into an economy

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.560
which provides only for them.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.040
I don't know if you've seen The Hunger Games.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.120
They have this city, which has one super luxury center

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.400
where all of the rich people live,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.440
living lives of unbelievable luxury,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.560
surrounded by terrible poverty.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.800
Listen, that is what investment

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.200
looks like in an unequal society.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.280
The only way to get investment

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.920
for you is to get wealth back.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.280
To get power back

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.280
from the superrich into the hands of ordinary families.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.480
And the only way to do that is to tax the rich.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.120
And I know I say it millions of times,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.600
and I'll say it millions of times more,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.040
because until we do that,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.880
our society will collapse into poverty.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.120
Taxation is the only way

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.840
to escape poverty for your kids and your grandkids.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.680
Tax the rich more, tax working people less.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.200
Save the f**king future. Good luck.
