00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.920
Today we're going to talk about burning money.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.480
All right.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.520
So this is a question which I've been asked recently

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.880
in a few interviews which is, all right Gary,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.360
if you are successful

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.520
in taxing the rich significantly more

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200
what would you do with the money?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.760
And I've given this answer in a few interviews

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.960
which is kind of me being intentionally controversial,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.240
which is to say that

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.840
if you were to tax the rich significantly more

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440
and literally burn the money,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.560
you would see a significant increase

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.160
in living standards.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.840
And there's a degree to which I say

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.920
that to be controversial,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.560
but I think I also want to illustrate

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.480
a really important point, which is that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
I think it is actually true.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.440
If you were to take this money to burn it,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.600
you would increase living standards.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.440
And the reason for this is,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.400
if you were to do this

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.080
really significantly, tax the rich and burn the money,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.560
you'd be basically exactly reversing

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.840
what we did economically as a society during Covid.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.880
So the reason I started this channel, for those of you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.920
who don't know, the first channel we did on this,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.880
the first video we did on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.680
this channel was a video called

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.720
How do the rich get rich from Covid 19?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480
It was in June 2020,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.560
and that's because it was very clear to me

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.400
very early on that during Covid,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.520
the government would give out

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
an enormous amount of money.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.960
That money would end up with rich people

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.520
and that would cause a collapse in living standards.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.080
I reference this video a lot on the channel,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.200
if you haven't seen it,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.720
you really should go and watch it,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.880
because it enabled me at the very beginning of Covid

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.520
to make a lot

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.480
of very accurate predictions

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.320
about what would happen after lockdown,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.680
which was that inequality would increase massively,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.600
house prices would increase massively,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.360
there'd be a big increase in inflation,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.280
there'd be a big collapse in living standards,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
there'd be big increases

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.800
in stock prices and the gold price.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.960
All these things happened basically.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.800
Now, at the time,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400
at the very beginning of Covid,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.000
to anyone who

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.960
would have bothered to look and do that analysis.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.520
It was actually very obvious

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.120
early on that an enormous amount of money would flow

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.800
from the government to the rich.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.080
And again, if you want to know how that mechanism works,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.440
we'll put the link to the video in the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.160
description.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.120
The amount of money that went

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.560
from the government to the rich during Covid,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.720
the total government deficit

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.960
since the beginning of Covid

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.320
is £800

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.760
billion,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.720
which would be enough to give

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.400
every single adult in the country £16,000 each.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.520
So if we make the simplifying assumption

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280
that that went to the top 5%,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.080
obviously it's a little bit

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.200
more complicated than that,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.800
but most of it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.440
did end up with the very rich,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.040
that would be enough

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.320
to give the top 5% of adults in the country

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.600
£320,000 each. Absolutely enormous amount of money.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.520
So let's think about what would happen

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.600
if we were to tax

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.320
all of these very rich people £320,000 each.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.720
That's per adult, right, not per family,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.640
and burn the money.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.080
Because I think it's

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.160
actually really interesting, it helps

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.400
you understand what has happened and how money works.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.960
First of all, it's a massive amount of money.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.320
£320,000 per adult

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240
is a lot of money, even for rich people.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.520
The top 5% is not all super, super, super millionaires.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.160
All right.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.280
If we say the top 1%,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.960
suddenly we're talking about £1.6 million

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.920
for every one of the top 1%.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.840
That’s a huge amount of money

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.360
these guys would straight away in many cases...

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.840
Well, first thing to say is a lot of

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.120
these guys have accumulated

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.160
a huge amount of money and are sitting on the money.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.920
So you get rid of that money.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.400
Now the government through the Bank of England

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.040
pays them interest on the money.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.840
So straight away

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.160
you collapse government interest payments,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.320
which means government deficit disappears.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.360
And the government doesn't have to do austerity.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.720
So number one, austerity finishes end of austerity.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600
Number two is in a lot of cases

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320
these guys don't have that cash

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.480
and they would have to sell assets.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.760
Now one of the biggest things that has changed

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760
since Covid is a transfer of assets

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.080
away from the middle class and towards the rich.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080
The way that you see that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.320
as an ordinary family is that if you are young,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.400
you can't afford the house,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.600
rich people are buying instead with cash.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.840
Or if you are older, your kids can't afford the house

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.440
because the rich people's kids are buying it with cash.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.280
So the rich have to start selling assets.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.640
They can't all sell them without somebody buying them.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.240
So assets transfer back from the government...

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.760
assets transfer back from the rich to the middle class

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.440
so that inequality decreases. Money flows back.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.000
The next thing is because they have to spend

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.280
an enormous amount of money on tax,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.520
they probably have to reduce their spending,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.840
which means you will see

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.720
a significant decrease in inflation.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.320
It's a lot of money £1.6 million.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.440
If these guys all stopped spending,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.360
you will see inflation collapse down,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.240
possibly into negative territory.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.240
So the next thing you see is

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.320
inflation goes negative,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.720
which means that the massive price increases

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.000
we've seen start to reverse.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.480
So again

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.120
you see a reversal of what happened during Covid.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.160
Well if that inflation collapses

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.840
well the central bank will have to act

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.960
because their job is to make sure

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.440
inflation say that 2%. So straight away

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.080
Bank of England interest rate collapses.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.360
It'll be the same if you're an America.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.560
Fed interest rate collapses.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.720
So assets go back to the middle class

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.080
inequality reduces, prices go down,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.800
interest rates go down, your mortgage payments go down.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.960
Every single one of these...

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.720
Oh, and the government debt goes down, government

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.640
deficit goes down.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.720
Every single one of these is the exact reversal

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560
of what happened during Covid.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.800
And every single one of these is driving up

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.640
the living standards

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.720
of ordinary families in the middle class.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.440
The government will have less assets.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.920
The government have less consumption.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.480
Those assets will go to ordinary families,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.480
and that consumption will go to ordinary families,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.440
and living standards will significantly increase.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.720
So what this highlights for me,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.480
the most important

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.560
thing to understand is at the beginning of Covid,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.360
when I said

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.840
the rich will accumulate an enormous amount of money

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.480
from the government,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.600
a lot of people said, why does that matter?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.480
Why does it matter if the rich accumulate money?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.200
This is politics of envy.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.360
You shouldn't care about the rich being rich.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.920
This shouldn't bother you.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.880
What underlies this,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.360
I think,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.640
is a fundamental misconception,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.440
misunderstanding of what money is.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.400
And I think

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.480
what it is, is a confusion of money for real resources.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.600
Now, if we suddenly magicked up out of thin air

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.240
a tonne of real resources,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.680
productive resources, and we gave it to the rich.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.240
This would not be a bad thing.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.440
Society would become more productive.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.840
Things would become cheaper.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.120
We've certainly got loads more stuff

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.440
now, we can all be richer.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.680
But money is not real resources.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.960
If you conjure up out of thin air

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.120
a tonne of money,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.480
most of this money was printed,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.880
and give it to the rich,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.440
that does not make society any more productive.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.640
Money is not a real resource.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.600
Money is not a productive resource.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.840
Money is a relative resource.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.000
Money is a competitive resource.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.160
Money is the resource which we use to determine

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.480
the distribution of the real resources.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.640
So if we give the rich a tonne of money

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.680
and we don't give you a tonne of money,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.600
they will use that money

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.880
to take a bigger share of the assets,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.720
to take a bigger share of the resources

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.840
to outcompete

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.520
you and your kids for assets and resources.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.000
And what you see is your family

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.440
losing its share of real resources,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.720
government losing its share of real resources,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.160
and in many cases, families

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.440
losing their share of basic essentials

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.800
like housing, like food, like energy.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.840
Money is a relative resource.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.800
This is why when we give a tonne of money to the rich

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.120
and we don't give a tonne of money to you,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.760
you lose out in terms of real consumption.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.360
And what you see is inflation.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.520
If we were to reverse that,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000
you would get a bigger share of assets.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.480
You get a bigger share of consumption.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.680
And what you would see is deflation.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.080
Now, I think this highlights the absurdity

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.480
and the stupidity of the way we handled Covid.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.760
Not that I'm against lockdowns.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.520
Sometimes people try to say I'm against lockdowns,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.720
so I don't really have an opinion.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.120
I'm not a doctor on these things.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.160
We should have recognised from the beginning

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.680
that it was going to be massive...

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.240
There was going to be a massive distributional effect

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.480
that was going to massively increase

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.160
inequality, a massive decrease in living standards.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.040
We didn't talk about it, but I should point out,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.200
I don't actually support this as a policy.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.920
I don't think we should burn the money.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.600
I think that would be

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.920
a quite absurd thing to do with the money.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.440
We can use that money, we can distribute directly.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.840
This amount of money would be enough

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.160
to give £16,000 to every adult in the country.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.240
Not every household, every adult.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.120
So this means if you are an adult, £16,000 to you,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.040
to your mum, to your dad,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.760
to your brother, to your sister, to your girlfriend,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.400
to your boyfriend,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.280
to your husband, to your wife, to your kids,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.840
if they're over 18, to every single one of your mates,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.840
this money could be used to make you

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.120
much, much, much richer.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.800
And once you realise the scale of it,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800
it should be obvious

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.120
that it is the cause of the decrease

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.080
in your living standards.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.760
And I think what the point

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.680
I'm trying to make, the underlying point is

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.400
when I talk about taxation of the rich,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.120
it is not about politics of envy.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.560
It is about the politics of power.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.120
It is about the politics of distribution.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.840
There is a group in society

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.320
which is getting rapidly, aggressively,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.640
richer and is massively increasing

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.680
its share of assets and wealth

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.480
and ownership and consumption

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.360
at the expense of the government and the middle class.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.720
It’s making the middle class poor, is making your kids

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.760
poor, it's going to make your grandkids poor.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.120
And it's closing down the welfare state

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.800
and the government.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.240
Listen, taxation is not about envy.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.040
Taxation is about power.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.840
These guys are going to eat you.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.880
They’re eating you alive.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.560
They're going to eat your kids.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.280
There is no way to stop them

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.200
other than taxation policy.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.680
You know, when I talk about...

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.240
when people...

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.360
when I talk about this and people

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.800
turn around to me and say, this is politics of envy,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.640
I feel like I'm sitting here

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.160
on a battlefield and there is an army invading

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.200
that is going to take all of your stuff.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.760
And I'm saying

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.200
maybe we should stop them from doing that.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.680
And you’re turning around to me and saying,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.800
that's politics of envy.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.200
There is competition in our society.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.040
These guys are getting more powerful.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.960
They're getting richer. They're taking your stuff.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.720
If you allow them to take all your stuff,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.600
you're going to be poor

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.440
and your kids lives will be poor.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.600
They're not paying taxes.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.000
You're paying taxes. That's an unfair system.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.440
Raise their taxes.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.640
Cut your taxes.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.360
Protect your kids from their kids.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.360
Allow ordinary families to afford things like housing.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.480
To afford things like a decent standard of life.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.360
It's the only way to prevent the country

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.560
from collapsing into poverty.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.800
We campaign for it every week here on Gary's Economics.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.480
Watch the videos. Share the videos.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.280
Tell your friends. Tell your mum.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.360
If we reverse it, we can make things better.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.720
If we don't, then we can't. I'm going to keep trying.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.760
I hope you do too. Thank you. Good luck.
