00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
so this idea that if you tax them they'll&nbsp;leave 
it is based on an intentional obfuscation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.440
and confusion of wealthy people who&nbsp;
are ordinary people with high-paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.240
jobs and super super wealthy people with&nbsp;
hundreds of millions of pounds of assets

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.120
okay I want to do one on the&nbsp;
difference between wealth and income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.840
uh we've covered this a bit on the channel before&nbsp;
but I think it's important to go over it once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.320
again to answer some of the most common questions&nbsp;
we're getting recently which are basically No.1&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.360
people who are not super rich but have decent&nbsp;
jobs and are worried we're trying to tax them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.960
and No.2 this question of if you tax the rich&nbsp;
they'll leave okay so first we need to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.320
cover very quickly the difference between wealth&nbsp;
and income uh income is basically about your job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.040
your salary the money you get from working where 
as&nbsp;wealth is about your accumulated assets uh 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.760
stocks &amp; shares, property, land... people that have high&nbsp;
amounts of wealth will get high amounts of passive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.280
income from the wealth that they own now on this&nbsp;
channel we have never once supported higher taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.760
on working people this channel has always been&nbsp;
about higher taxes on people with huge amounts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.920
accumulated hoarded wealth if you don't tax them&nbsp;
they will use their enormous amounts of income to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.480
buy the rest of the wealth, wealth inequality will&nbsp;
get higher and higher we will lose our middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.920
class and we will fall into poverty we need to&nbsp;
tax hoarded accumulated wealth and if we did that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.000
it would actually enable us to potentially lower&nbsp;
taxes on working people now how does this relate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.240
oh I should probably just add we're not even&nbsp;
necessarily advocating increasing taxes in general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.520
really this is about changing who pays taxes at&nbsp;
the moment we have a system where if you come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.720
from an ordinary background and you get a great&nbsp;
job and you make a lot of money you pay a ton of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.480
tax whereas The Duke of Westminster inherited&nbsp;
10 billion pounds and paid nothing, so at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.120
moment hard-working people are paying too much tax&nbsp;
super-rich are not paying enough so it's not about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.760
raising taxes on workers it's about raising taxes&nbsp;
on the very very rich, now how does this relate to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.320
the question of 'if you tax the rich they'll leave'&nbsp;
now the reason this is related is because a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.720
of people when I say raise tax on the rich they&nbsp;
assume I mean raise taxes on high earning working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.800
people now if you are a high earning working&nbsp;
person and I raise the taxes on your work you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
leave and you can work in another country and then&nbsp;
the UK will not get any of your income but I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.640
advocating that I'm advocating lowering tax on&nbsp;
working people and raising taxes on the super rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.680
now why is that more effective? people say&nbsp;oh but
the super rich are super mobile they are the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.120
mobile people they can leave, the reason that&nbsp;
the super rich are rich is because they own wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.200
what is wealth? wealth is your house wealth, is your&nbsp;
mortgage, wealth is the office block that you work in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.680
wealth is the Tesco down the street, wealth is&nbsp;Boots 
in your high street, wealth is the shopping centre right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.160
wealth is the farmland in the country okay&nbsp;these 
guys are rich because they own your mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.640
when you pay your mortgage it goes to them, they&nbsp;
can leave the country, it doesn't matter! because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.000
the money comes from you, what they need is for 
you&nbsp;to leave the country right a working person they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
are rich because they work, a wealthy person he is&nbsp;
rich because you work, he gets his money from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.080
how do you think Rishi Sunak gets 30 million&nbsp;
pounds a year passive income without working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.880
those payments come from you that are your&nbsp;
mortgage payments they are your rent payments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.920
they are the money that you pay in profits to&nbsp;
corporations his money comes from you so actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.040
the rich are the least mobile people on Earth&nbsp;
because their money comes from you what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.600
need is for you to leave so let's say these super&nbsp;
rich people they leave and they own your mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.000
or we can still tax it because the money comes&nbsp;
from you and you are still here these people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.200
actually the least mobile people on earth and the&nbsp;
best example we have of that was Roman Abramovich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.200
he is rich not because he works he is rich because&nbsp;
he owns, what he owned was Chelsea Football Club&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.800
and Chelsea Football Club is in f***in Chelsea&nbsp;
He can't f***in take it with him, so this idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.440
that if you tax them they'll leave is based&nbsp;
on an intentional obfuscation and confusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.520
of wealthy people who are ordinary people with&nbsp;
high-paying jobs and super super wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.320
with hundreds of millions of pounds of assets&nbsp;
these people are not the same working people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.280
can leave because they get their money from&nbsp;
their work rich people can leave but they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.600
their money from your work so we can tax their&nbsp;
income wherever they are because their income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.760
comes from you so this idea that 'you can't 
tax&nbsp;rich people, they'll leave' it's absurd and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.880
it's obviously put about by rich people who pay&nbsp;
tons of money to the IEA to send ideas like this

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.280
rich people are the least mobile people in the&nbsp;world 
financially because what they own is fixed&nbsp;assets&nbsp;

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.680
fixed assets; your mortgage, your house,&nbsp;
your office building, your shopping centre &nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.480
they can leave we can still tax them and if we 
don't&nbsp;tax them it's a political choice made by&nbsp;

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.200
in our country one of the richest men in the world&nbsp;
we can tax them and we have to if we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.800
we'll all pay the price! thanks, support&nbsp;
the channel, follow us, share the video

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.440
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.640
many more options in how we live our lives 
some&nbsp;of them put a lot of money into paying&nbsp;

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.240
economists &amp; thinktanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.720
