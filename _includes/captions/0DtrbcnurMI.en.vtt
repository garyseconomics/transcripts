00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
*how exactly do you make money doing that?* 
yeah&nbsp;so this is a question i get asked quite a lot

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.240
so i've said often on the channel that i made&nbsp;my 
money by betting the economy will be shit forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.320
people want to know exactly what that&nbsp;
means so i was an interest rates trader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.000
when you hear interest rates trading you&nbsp;should
always think that that's the trading&nbsp;of loans

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.400
essentially the borrowing and lending of&nbsp;money 
you want to borrow money at a low interest&nbsp;rate

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.320
and lend money at a high interest&nbsp;rate 
so i started working in 2008 in 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640
central bank interest rates went to&nbsp;
effectively zero all over the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.280
which meant that you could borrow money&nbsp;
effectively for free almost for no interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.840
but sometimes people will want to borrow money&nbsp;
in a year's time say for example you're a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.800
corporation and you've got a loan and you know&nbsp;
the loan is going to expire next year in june&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.600
okay so when next year june comes you're going&nbsp;
to need to get a new loan just like you might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
have a mortgage that expires okay so you've got&nbsp;
a loan it expires in a year and you come to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
trader at citibank and you say okay i want&nbsp;
to borrow money starting from next year okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.640
well at the moment we know that the interest&nbsp;
rate is zero but we don't know what the rates&nbsp;are

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.960
going to be in a year's time right? but for the&nbsp;whole 
sort of 12-year period between 2008 and 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.960
economists and traders generally thought&nbsp;
that the economy is about to recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
which means that interest rates are about&nbsp;
to go up so even though rates are zero now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.440
in a year's time they're probably going to be&nbsp;
like two percent, one and a half to two percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so if you were to call up a bank and say i want to&nbsp;
borrow money starting from next year they're gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.960
say okay well that's gonna cost you two percent&nbsp;
interest right but i came to the conclusion the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.880
economy would never recover which means that&nbsp;
rates would stay zero basically permanently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.080
so i could call these banks up and say okay&nbsp;
what's your interest rate for next year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.280
they'll say two percent i will say i will lend&nbsp;
you money at two percent next year and then i'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.840
just wait and then when next year comes as time&nbsp;
goes by time goes by it slowly becomes apparent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.400
to people that the economy is not recovering&nbsp;
and that interest rates are going to stay zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.720
so as we approach next year everybody starts to&nbsp;
realize oh actually rate's going to stay zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320
but that guy has already agreed to&nbsp;
borrow money from me at two percent right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.440
so as we come close to the time and the rates&nbsp;
are still zero i can then borrow at zero percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.600
lend that by two percent and make the&nbsp;
money in between and if you do that with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.160
a billion dollars then you make two percent of&nbsp;
a billion dollars which is 20 million dollars

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.640
so it's as simple as that basically like&nbsp;
for it's amazing for 12 years after 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.320
everybody thought well not everybody but the vast&nbsp;
majority of economists traders thought that rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.640
would go up the following year every single year&nbsp;
which meant that you could always lend money at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360
you know one and a half two percent&nbsp;
even though rates were currently zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.120
so you could just keep lending money at one and&nbsp;
a half two percent and then just wait a year buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.480
it back at zero and i did that trade you know 
i&nbsp;did that trade in 2011, i did the trade in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.960
and then after i quit banking i did that trade&nbsp;
myself every year you know i made money every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.400
year um and i know the people watching are going&nbsp;
to be like fantastic we can do that trade well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.720
unfortunately guys watching that trade is not&nbsp;
profitable anymore because now for better or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.160
worse my basic belief that rates will stay zero&nbsp;
forever is now basically the norm and everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.040
you know the the consensus now is that rates&nbsp;
never go up and i think it's worth seeing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.000
thinking about what that means because this is&nbsp;
kind of basically like the global economist in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.040
the market saying actually we agree with gary&nbsp;
the economy is [ __ ] forever and the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.360
does never get better it's like basically accepted&nbsp;
now in the markets you know that's pretty amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.960
that that's happened um and not only is it&nbsp;
terrible but it means i can't make money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.680
on that trade anymore which is even worse&nbsp;
than the demise of the global economy um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.480
but obviously i've still got other trades on&nbsp;
i think you know i don't want to talk too much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.880
about the trades i've got on now because i don't&nbsp;
want to encourage people into the world of online&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.560
trading which is very very dangerous which&nbsp;
we'll talk more about in future videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.560
um but yeah that's a question that i get&nbsp;
a lot what was the trade that you did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.200
um and that was it that's how i bet on and made&nbsp;
millions of pounds by predicting the disaster of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.840
the global economy and one thing i'd like to add&nbsp;
is it's a pretty mad world that we live in where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.000
you can be paid millions of pounds to predict the&nbsp;
collapse of the global economy and the next year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.960
you can get paid a million pounds again and at&nbsp;
no point does anyone ever think to say maybe we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520
should do something about this maybe you should&nbsp;
talk to the prime minister you know maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.880
should go talk to economist at universities 
do&nbsp;you see what i'm saying? i do and it's not the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.680
*i mean i'm aware of the story and originally&nbsp;
it's like well you realize no one else did*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.760
type of everyone's just a bit ignorant but you're&nbsp;
saying that actually there is the consensus now*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.240
*that that is the situation* yeah and i think this&nbsp;is
*you know that's alarming* this is why i wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.800
to make the video which we made before to explain&nbsp;
what is going on in the economy because right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.280
the media has no clue what is happening and is&nbsp;
massively misrepresenting and mis portraying &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.120
whats happening whereas financial markets 
understand&nbsp;that this situation is absolutely terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600
and things are going to be [ __ ] for&nbsp;
a long time if we don't do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.320
financial markets are accepting this but the media&nbsp;
is not accepting this so i think people need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.880
know because the problem is people in financial&nbsp;
markets know but they're all rich they are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.280
going to help you these guys are not going to&nbsp;
save it you know what i mean so the way things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.280
are going right now rich people are going to do&nbsp;
fantastically well ordinary people are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.480
massively [ __ ] and ordinary people are not&nbsp;
being told so that's why we have to do this we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.120
have to tell ordinary people what's happening and&nbsp;
ordinary people unfortunately need to be willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.880
to come together to push back against it because&nbsp;
no one is going to save us you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.720
rupert murdoch is not going to save these guys&nbsp;
you know what i mean boris johnson and kirsten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.720
neither of them are going to save these guys&nbsp;
you know what i mean and the financial markets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.960
are not going to save them and andrew bailey the&nbsp;
bank of england is not going to save them nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.920
nobody with a voice in economics comes from a poor&nbsp;
background these guys don't give a [ __ ] okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.080
they are not going to save ordinary people and&nbsp;
ordinary people are being convinced by youtube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.920
that the only thing they can do to fight back is&nbsp;
trade monkeys on the internet you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.880
or trade bitcoin you know what i mean listen if&nbsp;
there is no political response the future is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.800
to be a [ __ ] disaster and i don't take any joy&nbsp;
from saying that right this is why we are up here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.960
making these videos because i don't want that to&nbsp;
happen okay this is why i'm not in a skyscraper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.800
making two million pounds a year because i don't&nbsp;
want that to happen i don't want the future to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.160
[ __ ] but it will only not be [ __ ] if ordinary&nbsp;
people come together to do something about it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.200
i my worry is that with the last two and a half&nbsp;
years societal trust and societal cooperation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.000
broken down to a degree and if ordinary people are&nbsp;
not willing and able to come together we will lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.000
so we need to create a space where people come&nbsp;
together and support each other to fight back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.840
that means coming together across you know across&nbsp;
class boundaries across racial boundaries across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.400
you know every kind of boundary you know what i&nbsp;
mean we need men we need women we need people from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.800
every community to come together because everyone&nbsp;
who is from a poor and ordinary background&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.040
is going to be affected if we don't do&nbsp;
anything and it's going to require to a degree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.000
people willing to say look i'm not going to&nbsp;spend
my time trying to do online trading&nbsp;on the internet

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.200
i'm going to devote a bit of time to&nbsp;building 
some community to to come back against it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.880
because it's the only way it's the only way you&nbsp;
know it's only if we can only change it for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:55.600
positive if people come together so um that is&nbsp;
why you have to share this video i mean that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.200
all we can do you know we're trying to build&nbsp;
something get people together to um to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.200
things better to understand what's happening&nbsp;
and um i'll keep doing it you'll keep doing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.280
keep making them *um just a little follow on from&nbsp;
that it's interesting because you say that it's*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.440
*now the consensus that actually you're right and&nbsp;
interest rates will (i'm sure not everyone's like*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.480
*particularly gary's right) but that interest&nbsp;
rate* that's what they all say *in relation to*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.320
this cost of living crisis yeah they have actually&nbsp;
marginally put the interest rates up yeah i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.080
yeah exactly and i'm at this point i'm not betting&nbsp;
on the street staying low i do think interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.400
rates probably will stay quite low um i'm not&nbsp;
absolutely 100 certain i'm not as confident as i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.840
have been at times in the past um i'm not betting&nbsp;
on that at the moment uh interest rates could go a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.120
bit higher my expectation *if they're going up does&nbsp;
that mean the economy's not [ __ ] forever then?*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.920
not really because what is important this is&nbsp;
slightly technical it's not just the interest rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.200
but the real interest rate it's the difference&nbsp;
between the interest rate and inflation because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.080
you know there are a lot of very countries with&nbsp;
not great economies you know for example india&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.600
does not have a particularly strong economy on&nbsp;
a global scale which has high interest rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.840
but also high inflation which means effectively&nbsp;
your money's not growing right because you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.960
if you make seven percent a year on your money but&nbsp;
inflation is seven percent a year your actual real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.320
growth in your wealth is effectively zero&nbsp;
um and i think it's it's not impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.320
i don't think it's the most likely outcome&nbsp;
that the uk is sort of moving into this more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.760
situation which is common for poorer countries&nbsp;
where inflation is permanently higher and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.840
interest rates are permanently higher but you know&nbsp;
what matters is can you actually grow your wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.640
and you know if interest rates are you know at the&nbsp;
moment interest rates have gone up to i think 0.5%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.400
but inflation is like 7% so you know interest rates&nbsp;
have gone up but in in real terms you've never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.080
been losing more on your money year by year right&nbsp;
than you are at the moment in terms of purchasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.480
the power of your money so um interest rates will&nbsp;
definitely go up further than they are now there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.040
will be further interest rate hikes i suspect that&nbsp;
in the long run they end up coming back down but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.040
it's not impossible that they stay a bit higher&nbsp;
but only with higher levels of inflation in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:17.920
opinion and you know this is something which i'm&nbsp;
you know legit professional in and have but i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.760
not betting on introduction right now um because&nbsp;
i don't think that there i don't think that's

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.240
something that's particularly misunderstood&nbsp;
by markets at the moment you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.160
um i do think that the future looks&nbsp;
very bleak though if we don't if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.240
don't do anything and i think the only way to&nbsp;
change that is is political action and i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.360
mean that in terms of vote for this party&nbsp;
vote for that by i mean that in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.840
push for action on wealth distribution&nbsp;
wealth inequality taxation of the rich

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.240
so it's intentionally designed national&nbsp;
insurance so that very rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.960
pay a very low percent there is one other thing&nbsp;
they can do with that mass amount of income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.760
they can buy your mom's house
