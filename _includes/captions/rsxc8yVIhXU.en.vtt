00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.580
I guess what's made it hard especially&nbsp;
over the last sort of six months is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.900
that I've been working basically&nbsp;
full-time writing this book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.280
and I suppose to people watching the&nbsp;
channel don't know that so I've had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:25.560
kind of fit the YouTube in around the book um&nbsp;
and at the same time as I've been doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.140
the YouTube has really grown a lot&nbsp;
so first thing is it's been really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.940
it's been really great to see the YouTube&nbsp;
grow and I'll tell you why because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.780
as you know I've been betting on like gradual&nbsp;
accelerating deterioration of the economy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.840
a long time right and this is something that I've&nbsp;
had with me like for ages like this knowledge that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.460
the economy will get worse and worse and&nbsp;
um I first realised that as part of my job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.000
and I guess it's a weird situation to be&nbsp;
in like your job is to put on the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.280
being bad and you bet on it and the economy is&nbsp;
bad and then you get you make a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.120
and then you year after year watch the economy&nbsp;
get worse and worse and worse and my situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.680
was strange right because I was able to make a&nbsp;
lot of money by understanding the economy was bad

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
and then I quit doing that and I wanted to stop&nbsp;
the economy from being bad and it was almost like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.180
impossible to do it so you can go and you&nbsp;
can work for a bank and you can get paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.900
more than a million pounds a year to bet on&nbsp;
the economy being bad but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.440
work for that government for free you can't&nbsp;
if you want to walk into the universities and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.040
talk to the academics and be like listen&nbsp;
can we talk about why the economy is bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.520
they've got no interest right and it's it's

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.720
I I it's quite amazing right I think&nbsp;
the world we live in is quite amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.980
that somebody like me can get paid you know when 
I&nbsp;was in my mid-20s a million pound a year to bet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.820
on the economy being bad but I cannot do anything&nbsp;
to stop the economy from being bad even for free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.300
it's weird it's crazy right it's crazy you would&nbsp;
think that somebody who's worth a million pound a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.080
year to the banks should be worth employing&nbsp;
for free by the government or by the media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.560
um and yet and of course parts of the media have&nbsp;
been supportive you know like Laurie Macfarlane at&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.500
Open Democracy printed my first article um although&nbsp;
to be honest who's been supportive beyond that in&nbsp;the&nbsp;

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.880
media I mean we have had some support oh the guys&nbsp;
at Novara have been amazing have been really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.140
supportive and they've pushed us a lot like we're&nbsp;
really grateful for the support they've given us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.060
um but you know they're not the mainstream&nbsp;
media right so it's is difficult

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.060
when you know something's happening and you&nbsp;
can make a ton of money knowing that it's&nbsp;

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.400
happening but you can't do anything to stop&nbsp;it, 
you can't do anything to stop it and I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.220
wanted to see that for ages and I guess&nbsp;
what the YouTube has finally given me is

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.260
an outlet to try and do something that is&nbsp;
positive and I know like so far you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.240
our influence on actual policy has been limited&nbsp;
and things have been getting worse and worse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.920
worse um you know we're trying to become&nbsp;
more influential in the labour party and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.220
in the media and in sort of in the political&nbsp;
left and we have our small amount of influence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.400
um but at least what I can do now is I can explain&nbsp;
to people what's happening and I can try and build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.140
a platform such that we can start pushing for like 
policy change so it's been amazing to like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.280
know after a long long time of knowing that things&nbsp;
will get worse and not being able to stop it I&nbsp;feel&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.700
like now I have some small power to support&nbsp;
people and also a platform on which to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.060
bigger power um but I guess what&nbsp;
comes with that is the difficulty of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.160
now that you know you can maybe do something&nbsp;
someday then you have to start thinking a lot more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.660
strategically of like okay well maybe you have&nbsp;
a chance now to do something like when I first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.680
started doing this when I first started writing&nbsp;
articles we first made our video it was like we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.460
have to say something you know you just have to&nbsp;
say something so let's try and say something but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
now we have a voice and the voice is growing now&nbsp;
it's like well you have an obligation to start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.980
think a little bit strategically about how can you&nbsp;
build that with how can you build that power such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.500
you can actually make a difference down the line&nbsp;
and then adds another level of pressure on and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.020
I know because we get a ton of messages&nbsp;
that there are people out there kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
hoping that we make we manage to make this&nbsp;
work you know you know I get emails from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.520
people sending me their CV like we want to&nbsp;
support, we want to work and I really really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.660
appreciate that at the same time you see&nbsp;
that and it makes you realise like wow like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.840
people are counting on us to try and make a&nbsp;
difference down the line so it becomes like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.800
it becomes stressful and it becomes hard&nbsp;
especially when you consider like so I never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.780
was a writer but the last 9 months I've been throwing&nbsp;
myself into writing this book because I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.780
well to be honest at first when I first started&nbsp;
considered writing the book it wasn't the idea was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.640
like this could be a real springboard to use my&nbsp;
personal story which I've tried to avoid using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.060
too much to really like give us a much bigger&nbsp;
platform for the YouTube, for the Instagram, &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.620
for all of the social media platforms to push this&nbsp;
message but as I've started writing it like I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.160
really sort of fallen in love with the process&nbsp;
of writing and I really want to write something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.500
that is that has some beauty and is powerful&nbsp;
and it's emotional and it's been emotional for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.620
me to read and to write but I've been putting&nbsp;
so much of my emotional energy into that book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.040
that then it's hard at the same time to&nbsp;
to bring emotion to the YouTube as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.540
so I think I guess obviously the guys&nbsp;
watching the YouTube they don't know that like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.920
day after day every single day I'm writing writing&nbsp;
writing they don't realise like I've got that on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.860
the side as well and people sending messages that&nbsp;
you should do this, you should do that, they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.940
realise how busy I am you know what I mean
um but yeah it's difficult it's difficult and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.140
um on the subject of it being difficult one&nbsp;
thing I wanted to bring up was again answering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.940
a question that like I get sometimes&nbsp;
which is you know you're a rich guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.540
why do you care if it's difficult and we were&nbsp;
talking about this earlier right and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.880
the first thing is I think people okay and this&nbsp;
is partially my fault I think sometimes people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.960
sometimes overestimate how rich I am, they think&nbsp;
I'm Elon Musk or something you know I'm a rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.820
guy I made a lotta money in the city but I quit my job&nbsp;
a long time ago I don't have a job I don't have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.600
regular income so I'm living off of the money&nbsp;
that I saved I don't have enough money to like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.180
build a massive social media build a political&nbsp;
party like sometimes people say we should do but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.320
I think the second thing which I think is&nbsp;
quite interesting is this question of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.520
if you are rich should you care if you are&nbsp;
rich should you care if people are poor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.040
you know we were talking about this earlier&nbsp;
and I was saying so people who've watched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.400
this from the start will know I don't come from&nbsp;
a rich background right, I don't come from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.120
rich family, I don't come from a rich area and&nbsp;
my family and the people I grew up with and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.840
not just that by the people I live my life with in&nbsp;
this city, the people I meet, my friends are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.400
rich they're not from rich backgrounds right so&nbsp;
they live in this world that we've created now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.600
which is difficult to live in and especially&nbsp;
when you look what's happened the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.880
couple of years right so we're in London&nbsp;
London rents have gone mental right so now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.480
it's this city is difficult to live in now it's&nbsp;
difficult to live in and I'm not going to name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.720
names but a lot of people very close to 
me&nbsp;are just struggling just to get by and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.980
when people say like you're rich why should you&nbsp;
care I think it's easy to say that right but like

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.480
does that mean that I don't give a s*** about&nbsp;
my closest friends and family you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.620
or just the people that I live my whole life&nbsp;
with in the city you know I mean like I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.080
the thing which one of the things which most&nbsp;
upsets me about the inequality that we live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.200
is I think that we are now more and more&nbsp;
creating a society whereas an individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:37.680
your only options in life are to be poor or to be&nbsp;
separated from humanity that is the reality of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.560
vastly unequal society you because most people&nbsp;
are poor right and you know increasingly we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.680
seeing more and more people which is it's not&nbsp;
just relative poverty you know we're talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.540
about people struggling to pay the bills to pay&nbsp;
the rent right and the more unequal society gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:57.840
the more that's your choice right, you're either with 
the&nbsp;majority and you're poor or you're secure but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.460
you're separated from society and I think&nbsp;
increasingly we're living in a world where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.860
everyone is and has to be to some degree one of&nbsp;
those things you know what I mean like I was poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.580
growing up and now I'm financially secure but&nbsp;
what that means is I'm I'm separate from other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.100
people because other people are struggling&nbsp;
more and more see what I'm saying and um

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.300
that's the world that we live in and that's the&nbsp;
world that we are creating and it's and I feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.500
the stress of just the difficulty&nbsp;
of simple basic questions like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.900
where am I gonna, where am I gonna live, where 
am&nbsp;I gonna live? next month where am I gonna live?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.380
what's going to happen if my landlord&nbsp;puts the 
rent up? what's gonna happen if my landlord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.000
kicks me out, where am I going to live?&nbsp;these 
questions simple questions like am I going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.860
to be able to afford to have a family? these&nbsp;
questions you know these are questions which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.620
you know no matter if I can afford those things&nbsp;
you know what am I going to do am I going to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.000
for all my friends and family to have a family and&nbsp;
even if I was to do that right which I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.700
afford to do right even if I was to do that even&nbsp;
if I was to pay for like all of my family and my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.200
10 closest friends have their families right then&nbsp;
what happens when I go out the door and I walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.120
down the high street it's still full of these&nbsp;
people who are struggling and I think it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.420
I think it's I understand it right because you&nbsp;
know I was poor and I think when you are poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.860
when I was poor, you have this idea in your head&nbsp;
and I had this idea in my head, if I had money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:36.360
everything would be fine and that's the idea I had&nbsp;
right and this is in some senses this is the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.640
of my life that I made that money and I always&nbsp;
thought if you make the money you'll be fine and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.620
I wasn't fine because you still live in this world&nbsp;
with the people who are in this world you know I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.180
mean you're still living with this world of you&nbsp;know 
like your closest friends are insecure you&nbsp;know&nbsp;

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.560
what I mean? the girls that I date you know what I&nbsp;
mean they're insecure you know and they have this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.260
stress you know I mean and the young people&nbsp;
around me like they live in nowadays like if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.980
you're young there's two types of jobs right, a job&nbsp;
that you can't pay the bills and a job where you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.940
you have no time to sleep you know what I mean&nbsp;
those are the two types of jobs young people do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.980
and I live in the world full of young people that&nbsp;
either can't eat or can't sleep you know what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.780
mean and is that is that a good world to live&nbsp;
in and I see it getting worse and worse so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.100
you know that is that is the thing that I see&nbsp;
and every day I'm aware that I don't have those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.600
struggles you know like of paying the bills&nbsp;
but I still live in this world so it's sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.780
yeah it's it's difficult and I'm not you know&nbsp;
I'm not asking people to play the violins for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:44.580
me I know it's difficult but it is um it's hard&nbsp;
sometimes it's hard knowing that you have a voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.320
and wondering how to grow, and like now we're at&nbsp;
the kind of point with the with the channel where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.380
I can't read them I can't read the messages&nbsp;
anymore you know for a long time it was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.900
I'll reply to every message and then it was like&nbsp;
I don't reply to every message but I read every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.400
message you know and now it's like I can't even&nbsp;
read every message and it's like then and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.600
I'm starting to think like if it's going to grow&nbsp;
bigger and we want it to grow bigger and I've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.260
plans to make it grow bigger like up until now&nbsp;
like I haven't made any money from the YouTube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.280
you know what I mean and that's fine I don't&nbsp;
expect to make any money from the YouTube but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.940
it's getting to the point now but we're gonna&nbsp;
need support we're gonna need I'm gonna I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.180
gonna need support, I'm gonna need people&nbsp;
there to be able to read the messages for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.140
me and let me know what's going on and look out&nbsp;
for opportunities we can do so that I can focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.220
on writing and making the videos you know what&nbsp;
I mean and then I need to think about how we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.760
going to do that how we're going to finance that&nbsp;
how is it going to grow so yeah it's a lot it's an

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.180
you know I'm super happy I'm super excited but&nbsp;
then at the same time I'm also thinking like

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.980
so there are probably some people that will&nbsp;
say and I see them saying oh he's doing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.700
because he wants to just get that he wants to&nbsp;
get known he wants to get like famous he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.620
to get celebrity or whatever right so you know&nbsp;
I quit my job in 2014 and I didn't start this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.440
YouTube channel till 2020, and before that I've&nbsp;
volunteered at think-tanks, I made the website&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:20.700
I did a two-year Masters at Oxford because and&nbsp;
the truth is all through all of that I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.460
in my heart of hearts that realistically our&nbsp;
best chance at changing policy would be to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:34.080
an online platform pushing, using my story and&nbsp;
my face, pushing it to ordinary people to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.260
and build a public platform I always&nbsp;
knew that but I didn't want to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.660
because I didn't want to try and well to be honest&nbsp;
like I wasn't really sure I was comfortable with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:50.460
getting famous you know what I mean but now&nbsp;
like when the book comes out next year the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.660
aim is that, we don't know if it'll work or not but&nbsp;
the aim, is to try to build a big platform you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.620
and I need to think like what does that mean for&nbsp;
me? what does that mean for my life? you know like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.900
because at the moment it's just been me and you&nbsp;
and like for the people that don't know the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.500
that runs the channel you Simran is a friend&nbsp;
of mine from high school we've been friends for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:18.480
25 years now um but if it's going to get big then&nbsp;
it's going to need to be more people you know I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.020
mean it's gonna and it's just gonna be I'm gonna&nbsp;
have to start managing people and it's just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.460
there's so much to think about and at the&nbsp;
same time like I'm getting these creative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.120
opportunities like writing the book like making&nbsp;
the videos but also I need to start thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.500
the business side of things the financing side&nbsp;
of things and also the messages are coming in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.660
so it's like basically it's hard and um we I think

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.720
it's hard just to find the time because if&nbsp;
we're going to grow then I need to really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.280
sit down and make a business plan basically&nbsp;
make a financing plan make a plan about like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.060
who are we going to hire what&nbsp;
are they going to do you know um

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.440
but like I don't have the time to do that with&nbsp;
the writing the book with like publicising the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.760
book but they did in the book with also making&nbsp;
the videos so we'll probably have to stop doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.060
the videos at some point so we can make a proper&nbsp;
plan for growth make a proper plan for hiring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.660
so yeah it's a lot it's a lot to think&nbsp;
about but what I would like to say is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.360
I'm super grateful even though I've said&nbsp;
I don't have time to read all the messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.900
now and it breaks my heart a little bit&nbsp;
to say that because I would love to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.200
all the messages but I'm super grateful for&nbsp;
all the positive messages that we get because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.140
the bigger the channel grows the more we&nbsp;
get negative messages and as much as I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.740
like to be like you know 'I don't care about negative&nbsp;
messages' you read them and you see them and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.660
do stick with you but you know we are lucky that&nbsp;
for every 1 negative message there's there's 25-30&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:51.060
positive messages and you know when I'm walking&nbsp;
out I get stopped in the street and everyone has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.360
something positive to say so as much as I've&nbsp;
said like I'm not sure about becoming famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.400
that is important it's important that we get that&nbsp;
positive stuff because because otherwise it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.340
be hard to keep doing this you know what I mean&nbsp;
and I think like people see the channel growing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.600
and growing and they're like well done it's great&nbsp;
but they don't realise most of my days are in here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.160
in that room writing the book in here filming&nbsp;
videos in here planning videos like it's very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.420
it's quite isolating and it's quite it's quite a&nbsp;
lonely work you know what I mean like it's we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:27.660
started doing Covid when there was no one around&nbsp;
um so those messages that we get are important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.260
um because they keep me motivated I'm&nbsp;
sure they keep you motivated as well um

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:41.400
but I think what I would like to say is that&nbsp;
recently I've been thinking more about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.400
do we grow it big because I think we do have a&nbsp;
chance to to listen I didn't start this to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.380
a guy on YouTube I started this because I want&nbsp;
to reduce inequality and I know that's not easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.700 --> 00:17:00.480
but I think we have a chance to be a part of that&nbsp;
and what I will say for sure 100% sure is you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.520
see political change in the next 10-15 years, big&nbsp;
political change, the reason I say that is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.100
the speed at which living standards are falling&nbsp;
have fallen in the last 2-3 years it's&nbsp;massive&nbsp;

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.180
and I don't think they'll keep falling&nbsp;at that speed 
but from here they're going to keep&nbsp;falling&nbsp;

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.640
quickly and people are going to be mad,&nbsp;
people are gonna be mad, people are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.640
be angry, people are going to be scared, people&nbsp;
are going to be insecure and they're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.340
vote for change and in most cases because we're&nbsp;
in a situation where the political mainstream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.160
is just unable to provide serious change and&nbsp;
I'm not talking about just the UK here this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.240
is international you know you're going to see&nbsp;
you know there was an election in Finland the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.360
other day and they voted at the centre-left and&nbsp;
they vote in the center-right those guys are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.780
going to improve things, we've got an election&nbsp;
here next year where we're going to vote out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.320
conservatives &amp; vote in labour probably realistically&nbsp;
those guys are not going to improve things right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.880
if people keep voting in centre left,&nbsp;
centre right, centre left, centre right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.980
and seeing deterioration deterioration they&nbsp;
will vote for change they will vote for change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.100
and we could get positive change&nbsp;
and we could get negative change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:10.260
and we are in a position where if we grow this we&nbsp;
could be one of those people that push ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.580
people in the direction of positive change better&nbsp;
living standards because I guarantee you right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
the other side is gonna, I know what they're&nbsp;
gonna do, I know what they're going to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.000
they're going to try and sow division&nbsp;amongst 
the general public between people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.280
own property &amp; people who don't, between&nbsp;the 
native white people &amp; the immigrants you&nbsp;know&nbsp;

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.620
they're going to try and sow like racial based,&nbsp;
you could see that in the in what's happening now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.040
you can see that's all over the newspapers&nbsp;
right now in the way that they talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.260
refugees and the way that they mix them in with&nbsp;
economic migrants, this kind of stuff, you can&nbsp;see&nbsp;

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.800
that's going to happen, they're going to try&nbsp;and build 
more animosity between the older &amp; the young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.100
they're going to try and build animosity&nbsp;between 
the North &amp; the South, and it will be the&nbsp;same in&nbsp;

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.840
every country that is the direction that&nbsp;
they're going to push things in and if they win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.720
then you know you're going to see some really&nbsp;
problematic change in society and at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.800
the economic situation is going to get worse so&nbsp;
I think that there will be change and I think we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.400
we can make it positive change you know people&nbsp;
there's a lot of fatalism I see in the messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.860
where people say oh it was always that way it's&nbsp;
always that way it's the problem with human nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:27.300
you know what I mean and listen our parents&nbsp;
neither of our parents neither of your parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.700
neither of my parents have university degrees right 
and&nbsp;they were able to buy property, raise families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:39.960
it was possible 40-50 years ago so things change,&nbsp;
things change, and our our grandparents and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.600
great grandparents were poor, things change things&nbsp;
change in a positive way for our parents right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.500
and now they're changing a negative way&nbsp;
for our generation &amp; for generations in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.840
future and the reason that things change in a&nbsp;
positive way is because people push for it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.020
that brings me to my final point that&nbsp;
I want to end this on right which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.560
I was out the other day at a friend's birthday&nbsp;
party I think he was 50. he's older than me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:14.760
so people know um and I was talking to one of his&nbsp;
nephews and the nephew was like tell me like how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.100
do I make money trading he watches the channel&nbsp;
right 'how do i make money trading?' and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.820
is the thing that we get a lot on the channel how&nbsp;do 
i make money trading, how do we, and of course okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.820
everybody who watches the channel knows um was 
formerly a&nbsp;very successful professional trader I still trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.560
I still make money and we have a few videos about&nbsp;
trading on the channel and the general message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.340
is don't f***ing trade don't trade because it's&nbsp;
dangerous man it's dangerous it's gambling you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.640
can lose money and of course people turn around&nbsp;
they're like well you do it you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.460
and you know I was a professional I did because&nbsp;
I was a professional because I was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.280
best people in the world at it, I think I still&nbsp;
am one of the best people in the world at it

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.540
so I trade you know you know this is why why does&nbsp;
Lionel Messi play football because he's damn good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.800
you know what I mean like I trade because this is&nbsp;
my profession this is my skill this is what I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:09.360
trained 20 years for you know what I mean um and&nbsp;
what I try and tell him it's like I tried to say&nbsp;you

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.900
know he, I don't know how old he was he could&nbsp;
have been 18-19 and what I said to him listen

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.100
the only way for you to protect yourself&nbsp;
your family your community your future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:28.020
is to learn how to politically engage with&nbsp;
your friends in your wider community because

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.520
you cannot beat the rich as individuals you&nbsp;
cannot but with we've created society that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.540
trains our young people into like hustle for you&nbsp;
hustle for you hustle for you hustle for you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:50.340
this is the perfect mindset to completely&nbsp;
enable the rich to take everything because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.220
let's say like I'm a rich guy and I'm the&nbsp;
strongest guy in the room I'm 10 times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.760
as stronger as anyone else in the room&nbsp;
and I walk into a room full of a&nbsp;thousand

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.500
people and my plan is to take all the&nbsp;assets 
of everyone in that room what do I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.140
I want these guys to fight me one at a time right&nbsp;
that's it if these guys fight me one at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.760
I'll be every single one of them one at a time&nbsp;
and if these guys are unable to politically unite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.220
then they will lose everything they will lose&nbsp;
everything that is and it's so I think we we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.900
have in a sense a cultural problem in our society&nbsp;
and and I understand it because I was the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.740
when I was younger when I was poor myself I was&nbsp;
out to look after me you know and because no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:32.820
else was looking after me I understand it but if&nbsp;
people in poor and ordinary financial situations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.440
are not able to look beyond their front&nbsp;
garden and towards their wider community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.600
and say listen we need to get together and&nbsp;
start acting as a group then every single one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.900
of them individually will lose what they have over&nbsp;
time so it is a question of can we unite, can we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.920
politically you know and there's people have been&nbsp;
saying you know we need to put a call to action in the

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.040
videos and there was a period where we were doing&nbsp;
that, do you remember what the call to action was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.680
right it was three things it was three things&nbsp;
right the first thing was understand what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:10.200
happening understand what's happening and you know&nbsp;
the reason that I stopped doing mainstream media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.300
or I do much less is because I would go on talk&nbsp;
radio I'll go on LBC and I would fight with some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.120
guy from some right wing think-tank you know what&nbsp;
I mean and yeah sometimes I would win you know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.260
then I would I would put down the phone put down a&nbsp;
zoom call and I would be like okay you had a fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:31.560
on the radio who was educated who was educated&nbsp;
the way that we win is by providing ordinary  

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.080
working class people with an understanding of&nbsp;
the situation the truth of the matter is if&nbsp;things 

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.180
keep going the way they're going and there&nbsp;is no 
systemic change then the whole of the bottom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:48.540
70-80% will be dispossessed they will lose their&nbsp;
assets they'll fall into poverty if that 70-80%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.400
understand it they will vote against it and we can&nbsp;
change the situation so number one was understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.220
number two was share the message and the reason&nbsp;
I said that is because it is only through building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.240
communities that we can win, we cannot win as
individuals, I cannot win this as an individual you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.600
know I'm going to try and build as much as I can&nbsp;
but I cannot win this as an individual, none of us can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.320
we can none, we're not going to beat Rupert Murdoch&nbsp;
you know we're not going to beat the billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.880
we're never going to be billionaires but together&nbsp;
we can still exert our power but only together &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.580
we can only win together so it's number one educate&nbsp;
yourselves it was number two share the message and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.360
it was number three push back and I see people&nbsp;
saying how do we push back how do we push back &nbsp;

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.820
but we need to be strong enough we need to be strong&nbsp;
enough we need to be enough of us and we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.960
understand it so we need to build the message we&nbsp;
need to grow it and then when we have it then we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.240
will push we'll push we'll push through political&nbsp;
means if we can and if it has to be other ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.160
then we'll look at other ways but we need to be&nbsp;
strong enough and at the moment the working class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.620
is is too divided and there are too many people&nbsp;
that are just looking for their own thing and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.000
willing to organise beyond that politically and I&nbsp;
understand that and I would never say to anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.520
come support us and don't look after your family&nbsp;
look after your family look after yourself but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.360
you need to be willing and able to open your&nbsp;
mind to those bigger political possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.000
um but if we do that we can win and we have to&nbsp;
win and there will be change there will be change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.840
and positive change has happened before you know&nbsp;
look what happened after the Second World War&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.660
you know for the first time ever we had countries&nbsp;
across Europe also in the United States where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:24.480
ordinary working people could get good quality&nbsp;
housing, education, healthcare, food, leisure time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:31.380
these things were possible 70 years ago they're&nbsp;
possible now but we're losing them but we won&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.400
them before and we can win them again but we can&nbsp;
only win them together so yeah I would encourage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.700
everybody watching to support the channel follow&nbsp;
us share us um we're going to be trying to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.060
out how to build that it might mean that we need&nbsp;
to take a bit of time out it might need to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:50.520
looking at how we're going to fund it long term&nbsp;
but um we're still here and we'll keep pushing
