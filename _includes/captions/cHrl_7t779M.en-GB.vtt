00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.720
Today

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.760
we are going to talk about

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.720
revenue raising and redistribution.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.320
Okay.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.080
Today I'm going to dispel

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.000
a couple of the common myths about tax.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.560
So we exist

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.240
in a country and increasingly

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.400
a world where governments

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.760
can't pay for the things they need
 
12
00:00:20,760 --&gt; 00:00:22,960
because they don't have any money.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.920
So people are talking about how can we raise money?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480
And when I talk about taxing the rich,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.600
people think that it's mainly about revenue raising.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.440
This is true.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.240
It's true.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880
Increasingly we are in a situation

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
where the middle class are very squeezed

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.160
and they don't have much money.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.480
So if you want to actually provide

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.400
decent public services,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.120
you have to go after the very rich.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.880
But I don't actually push for taxation

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.040
because I want to raise revenue.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800
The reason I push for taxation

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.480
is because ever since I was a trader in the early 2000,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.880
I realised that the economy wouldnâ€™t recover

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.520
because wealth was being transferred

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.120
very quickly from the middle class

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.000
and from government to the super rich.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.720
If the middle class loses its wealth

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.840
and the government loses its wealth,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.080
the economy will lose its spending

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.160
power, wages will collapse,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.520
the rich will become very rich,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.600
and asset prices will go through the roof.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.720
This is the world we are living in.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.880
Unless you are very rich,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.560
your family and your government is losing its wealth

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320
and you are becoming poor.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.000
For me, tax, whilst revenue raising is a factor,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240
tax is primarily

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760
about protecting ordinary people

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
from the rich and stopping wealth transfer

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.600
from ordinary people to the rich.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.000
Listen, unless you're very rich,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.680
the assets you own now

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.480
will not be owned by your kids and your grandkids.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.240
Those assets will pass to the very rich

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360
because they have enormous amounts of passive income,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.760
which their kids can use to outcompete your kids.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.200
And your kids will end up owning nothing.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.840
This is what I'm trying to avoid.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.920
For me,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.960
taxation is about protecting

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.760
the assets

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
of ordinary British families

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.040
and Americans and Australians

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.840
and all the other guys who are watching the channel.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.720
It's not just about revenue

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.760
raising, tax is about defence,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.680
defence, defence, defence.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.320
I want you to view tax as equivalent to an army.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.080
You have an army to defend yourself from other armies.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.560
You have taxes to protect yourself from the rich.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280
We had taxes for a long time, and people like my dad

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.000
and my friends

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.040
dad could afford houses, your kids

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.080
and your grandkids will not be able to afford houses

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.400
because those houses will be bought by the rich.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.200
The only way to protect yourself from

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.360
that is to tax the rich more.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.960
It's not about revenue raising, it's about defence.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.280
The next point is redistribution.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.800
A lot of people don't like my channel

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.320
because they think I'm a communist

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.560
who is calling for redistribution.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.120
I'm not calling for redistribution.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640
The redistribution is happening.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.360
I'm trying to stop the redistribution.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.120
Every year,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.960
every decade, every generation,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.920
the middle class and governments get poorer

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440
and those assets gets transferred to the rich.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.280
The government and ordinary families

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.400
end up deeper and deeper in debt to the rich.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.600
This is a redistribution.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
The redistribution is happening.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.960
The middle class is dying.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.080
They are being eaten by the rich.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320
I'm not trying to redistribute wealth.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.680
I'm trying to stop the redistribution of wealth

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600
so that your kids and your grandkids

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.000
can have something to have kids of their own.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.640
So to conclude, tax is not about revenue raising alone.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.800
It's about defending yourself from the rich.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.400
Redistribution from the rich to the poor

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.560
and the ordinary

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.280
might be nice in an ideal world,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.920
but right now the main thing is to stop them

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800
from eating your assets alive.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.480
Protect yourself

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720
from the rich, raise taxes on the super rich,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.120
the hoarders of wealth, lower

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.680
taxes on ordinary working people.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.360
Tell your friends, tell your mum, support the channel.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.000
Thank you.
