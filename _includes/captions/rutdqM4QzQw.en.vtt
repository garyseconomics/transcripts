00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.480
so for this we're going to talk about investing&nbsp;
personal finance and because i get asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.840
on all my social all the time can you give me some&nbsp;
advice what can i do with my money how can i make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.680
more money for my money um so the first thing i&nbsp;
want people to understand is basically i talk a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
lot in my videos about how wealthy people make&nbsp;
a lot of money from their money so if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.680
like £10million which a lot of wealthy&nbsp;families 
do then they might make £300,000&nbsp;a year

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.480
just from their money it's important to&nbsp;
understand that they're able to make that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.360
because they are so super rich so it's pretty&nbsp;
ordinary for wealthy people wealthy families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.800
to make sort of 3-5% from&nbsp;their money 
that's where i get these numbers from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.400
so then if you have a family wealth of £10million&nbsp;
you can make £300,000&nbsp;- £500,000

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.320
um and that's easy enough&nbsp;to live a 
good life off but for ordinary people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.280
who might have £10,000 - £20,000 if you 
make&nbsp;3% you know it's better than not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120
making it but it's not gonna change your life&nbsp;
right if you have £20,000 savings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.200
and you make 3% that's going to&nbsp;make 
you £600 a year right which is&nbsp;great

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.640
you want to make it £600 a year&nbsp;but 
it's not going to change your life so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320
i have a bit of a concern that sometimes people&nbsp;
come to me asking for advice and often what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160
really want is kind of get rich quick schemes&nbsp;
you know we've seen a lot of people make a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.160
of money very quickly on things like bitcoin and&nbsp;
things like this in recent times um or tesla these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.200
sort of things have gone up super quickly and&nbsp;
um i think often when people ask for this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.760
of advice that's what they're looking for you&nbsp;
know they're looking to like make you know huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.680
amounts of money despite only starting with 
10 20 £30,000 i think it's important for people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.680
to realize the reason that super rich people and&nbsp;
very rich people are able to make huge amounts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.680
money from their money is because they start with&nbsp;
huge amounts of money so these guys who already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.200
have even £1million, £2million that 
can make&nbsp;you like £50,000 £100,000

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.120
a year to live off but for ordinary people&nbsp;
who might have savings of 20 30 £40,000

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.040
you're not going to make life&nbsp;changing 
sums and people who do offer you sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.880
of get rich quick schemes invest 20 30 
£40,000&nbsp;you're gonna make a £100,000

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.440
please be very very skeptical of those&nbsp;guys 
they're probably not people you can trust um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.720
realistically what we're talking about is if&nbsp;you 
can make 10% 20% from your money then you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.200
doing really really really well but even that if&nbsp;
you make 20% which is a really super good return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.520
and you start with £50,000 that's making you&nbsp;
£10,000 a year so it's obviously it's great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.680
money but that's a fantastic return and it's&nbsp;
um you know it's not going to change your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.040
so that's the first thing um when we talk&nbsp;
about investing you need to understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.960
it's not going to make huge amounts of money&nbsp;
unless you start with huge amounts of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.320
and that's an important point because i often&nbsp;
think people come to me from ordinary backgrounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640
even maybe poor backgrounds like where i'm&nbsp;
from and they see investing as a way out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.840
out of poverty out of a difficult situation but&nbsp;
the truth is the way things are set up right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.920
it's not a reliable way out and um everything&nbsp;
you do every way you try to make money by for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.240
example you know betting on bitcoin or um betting&nbsp;
on the stock market is risky you can lose money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.200
basically it's not a reliable way out and&nbsp;
the reason why i talk about what i talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.800
saying we need to bring in a wealth tax is&nbsp;
because these kinds of solutions encouraging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.880
ordinary people to gamble on the stock market&nbsp;
to gamble on cryptocurrencies i think they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.000
super dangerous basically and they're not&nbsp;
reliable ways out and the only way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.960
people as a whole are going to improve their&nbsp;
lives is basically by bringing changes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.520
tax system and making the wealthy people pay&nbsp;
higher taxes okay but that said there are a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.000
few things ordinary people can do and we're going&nbsp;
to talk about what you can do oh but before i get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.920
into that i just wanted to quickly add you know&nbsp;
if you are lucky enough to have say £50,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.160
£100,000 that you can invest and that's&nbsp;
kind of the amount of money that you really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.040
need to be able to make like really significantly&nbsp;
sums of money that are going to affect your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.720
um just be aware that there's people out there&nbsp;
that don't have that and a lot of people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.600
have that um one of the pieces of advice i'm&nbsp;
going to give is that if you don't have property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.760
you should probably try and get property just&nbsp;
please be aware that there's like a huge number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.840
of people especially young people out there&nbsp;
for whom that's just not a possibility so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.640
yeah have a bit of awareness that if you do&nbsp;
have money saved up even though things might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.080
difficult for you there are other people out there&nbsp;
that don't have money saved up and things are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.920
difficult for them when i talk about changing the&nbsp;
system to make it fair for everyone that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.680
to benefit you but it's also going to benefit&nbsp;
those people who have less and you know i'm super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.200
aware of the people out there might be watching&nbsp;
that don't have that kind of money as well um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.160
so what you can do really is super different&nbsp;
depending on where you are you know i'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.760
going to patronize people who are struggling to&nbsp;
get by every day by telling them that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.280
much they can do the truth is those people are&nbsp;
already doing everything they can right if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.720
struggling to pay the bills you just got to keep&nbsp;
struggling like you're not going to make money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.360
from investing and um if you've only got a few&nbsp;
thousand pounds that you desperately need please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.040
don't be dragged into get rich quick schemes&nbsp;
you might see on the internet like bitcoin like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.640
big bubbles in certain stocks like gamestop&nbsp;
or like tesla um you might have seen people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.080
make money for them of course it's possible&nbsp;
but the truth is if you don't have a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.840
of money to risk you shouldn't be getting&nbsp;
involved because those things can drop 80%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.360
90% we've seen happen in the past and you could&nbsp;
lose everything you put in um yeah so if if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.360
struggling to get by the main thing you need to do&nbsp;
is encourage people to support greater taxation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.560
the rich because that is the only way that's going&nbsp;
to really help the poorest people in our society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.160
if you're lucky enough to have saved up a&nbsp;
bit more money 20 30 40 50 £100 000

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.280
i would say your first priority should always be&nbsp;
to get um property and this goes back to things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.960
i've been talking a lot about in my videos right&nbsp;
so i've mentioned in my other videos about covid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.280
that there's been a huge amount of money&nbsp;
printing that's going to devalue money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.880
devaluation of money is kind of&nbsp;
a complicated concept right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.920
if you devalue money you know we normally think&nbsp;
of the price of whatever devalued things going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.440
down but what is the price of money right 
you&nbsp;know the price of money can't go down&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.760
£1 is £1 but if money itself devalues what we&nbsp;
will see is the price of everything else going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.600
and uh in particular because the people who are&nbsp;
benefiting from covid are largely richer people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.440
tend to buy assets i expect to see the price of&nbsp;
assets like property like stocks and shares like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.760
gold go up very quickly whereas wages probably&nbsp;
won't go up obviously that's not good news for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.440
most ordinary people but it's also not good news&nbsp;
for people who have their savings in cash so how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.560
do you avoid that? the main thing i would say is&nbsp;
really avoid keeping large amounts of savings in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.120
cash um i know that we're conditioned to think&nbsp;
that keeping your money in cash is the safest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.280
thing to do but when you're in a climate like&nbsp;
we're in now where prices of assets are going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.920
very quickly including property if you're sitting&nbsp;
on £50,000 in cash and the house price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.320
doubles which unfortunately could do especially&nbsp;
here in london or even other parts of the country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.800
that is really not a good situation for&nbsp;
you right so i would really encourage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.400
if at all possible as soon as possible get&nbsp;
yourself some property because that gives you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.000
the security that you can um that might involve&nbsp;
trying to get together as a family borrow money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.720
from your parents it's important for people from&nbsp;
poor backgrounds to realize the reason why young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.280
people get property is almost always because their&nbsp;
parents give them money and um this is the thing i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.520
want to let people know because i know that people&nbsp;
from my sort of background poorer backgrounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.880
they see other people buying property and they&nbsp;
don't understand how it's possible because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.000
almost impossible if you're in london even if&nbsp;
you're on like a higher salary like 40 50 £60,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.160
it's impossible to save up that deposit&nbsp;
it takes years and years and years and years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.840
but people from richer families are&nbsp;
getting that money from their parents so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.280
you know it's an unfair system but if you're from&nbsp;
a poor family the most important thing is to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.880
hold of property that you have and to try and&nbsp;
get property for younger people that's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.800
be the real challenge going forward especially&nbsp;
with property prices increasing as quickly as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.320
they are now i know that's not super positive&nbsp;
advice for a lot of people to hear because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.680
a lot of people they simply can't buy property&nbsp;
and you know this is why i do the work that i do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.000
because you know i predicted a year ago that&nbsp;
property prices were going to go up despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.320
the worst economic crash in you know about 100&nbsp;
years that's insane but it's happened all right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.800
we've had the worst economic crashing injuries and&nbsp;
probably prices have gone up that's because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.560
way that governments have dealt with the crisis&nbsp;
which is to print money give it to rich people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.240
the people that get hurt from that are poor&nbsp;
families don't have property but also ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.280
families i want to send the message out to&nbsp;
ordinary families that own property that might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.480
think they're winning when house prices go up um&nbsp;
so the older members of those families that own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.240
the houses they might think they're making money&nbsp;
when house prices go up but they need to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.960
the only way to make that money is to sell&nbsp;
their house and if you sell your house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.960
then your kids won't have houses and if house&nbsp;
prices double then your kids won't be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.160
get houses with their own money so the&nbsp;
end result of this massive increase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.520
house prices is basically more and more ordinary&nbsp;
families going to lose their houses over the long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.120
run so i would like to have a message for older&nbsp;
people that own property that might be excited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.640
when house prices go up is think about how this&nbsp;
is going to affect your kids and your grandkids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.160
the end result is basically going to be that most&nbsp;
people in this country will not own property in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.840
20 30 40 years time and the amount of people&nbsp;
who own property going to go is going to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.720
less and less and less and less and less um and&nbsp;
that's going to make life worse for most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.720
um so look i see it in the families around me&nbsp;
right my friends who are from richer backgrounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.560
their parents give them a hundred grand they&nbsp;
re-mortgage the house give them a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.840
grand and the kids buy property but my friends&nbsp;
are often poor backgrounds i've got friends who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.320
are from single parent families their mums have to&nbsp;
sell the house to get by and the kids get nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.720
so what we are seeing now with this&nbsp;
massive increase in house prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.400
don't get excited about it because what it is&nbsp;
what is causing is a divergence basically where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.480
if you've got 10 properties of course that's&nbsp;
great you've probably got a stock portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.720
as well that's gone up 10 times but if you&nbsp;
have no property your family's in big trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.840
i don't i don't bring me no joy to&nbsp;
say that but if you have one property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.000
probably also your kids and your grandkids will&nbsp;
become unable to own property in the future so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.960
really if we want to stop that as a group we have&nbsp;
to do something about inequality and that's why i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.560
said we have to tax the super rich it's the only&nbsp;
way to do it but as an individual like i said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.800
i get asked what can do with your money the main&nbsp;
thing is protect your property and if you can buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.360
property if you're young if you can buy property&nbsp;
and if you're older help your kids buy property um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.920
yeah you know that's not a positive message but&nbsp;
it's not a positive time if we don't fix the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.560
economic system um but yeah if you are unable&nbsp;
to buy property now which i understand like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.720
lot of young people are um and you're worried&nbsp;
about the deposit you've saved up being devalued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.720
there are sensible things you can do um don't&nbsp;
keep it all in cash invest in stocks and shares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.120
invest in gold i've got a lot of money invested in&nbsp;
gold also have some invested in stocks and shares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.880
um stocks tend to do well if the economy is good&nbsp;
so if you're an economic optimist you might want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.560
to buy more stocks gold tend to do better when&nbsp;
the economy is bad so if you're an economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.480
pessimist you might want to buy more gold i've&nbsp;
got more gold if you buy a mixture of both then

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.720
you will probably be a bit more&nbsp;
secure whichever way it goes um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.440
the best way to do that for an ordinary person to&nbsp;
open a stocks and shares ISA that's if you're here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.640
in the UK um you can put £20,000 into that&nbsp;a year
you can just buy normal gold funds or global&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.400
stock tracker funds i recommend buying tracker&nbsp;
funds that buy a basket of stocks rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.240
individual stocks because they're less risky um&nbsp;
you can only put £20,000 a year into an

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.160
ISA but if you have more you can just get what's&nbsp;
called a general investment account there's plenty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.560
of providers online um i use free trade i use&nbsp;
hargreaves &amp; landsdown but there's plenty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.680
of providers that will give you ISAs that's&nbsp;
independent savings accounts uh they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.400
some tax advantages and if you have more money&nbsp;
general investment accounts GIAs um but yeah if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.360
you have money saved up you're worried about being&nbsp;
devalued buy stocks buy gold don't leave it in&nbsp;cash

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.040
um obviously keep some cash um and i have to&nbsp;
add to that like whenever i give advice like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.520
every single time you buy an asset gold stocks&nbsp;
anything there's risk involved um i think they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.360
going to go up in general because cash is being&nbsp;
devalued but that's no guarantee um be prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.160
when you put the money in the value fluctuates day&nbsp;
to day could go up it could go down i think you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.040
more secure holding stocks in gold over the long&nbsp;
term than cash but um yeah there's no guarantee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.600
when you buy things there's risk involved um&nbsp;
yeah what have you got any questions on that

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.720
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.040
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:13:01.280
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;
is important for the economy that is not true
