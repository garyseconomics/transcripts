00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400
...Mortgage advisors it is important to understand&nbsp;
they are often financially incentivised to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.320
push you towards certain mortgages and often&nbsp;
they are the mortgages that are worse for you...

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.080
all right so um the most important thing almost&nbsp;
always on your mortgage is the interest rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.640
almost always. like a small difference because&nbsp;the
amounts the size of mortgages are normally so&nbsp;large&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.520
like 0.1% or 0.5%&nbsp;make a massive 
difference on your payments right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.200
um sometimes what mortgage advisors 
it is important to understand

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.600
they are often financially incentivized&nbsp;
to push you towards certain mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.760
and often they're the mortgages that are worse&nbsp;
for you it makes sense in a way right because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040
the banks want you to take a mortgage that 
is bad&nbsp;for you, because that's good for them

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.960
so the banks incentivise your mortgage advisors to
push&nbsp;you towards mortgages that are bad for you

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.400
so what sometimes happens is for example&nbsp;
they'll say here's one mortgage which is a 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.120
15 year mortgage and has a high interest rate 3%
and then the total amount of interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.040
you pay is this amount (small) and here's another&nbsp;
mortgage which is a 35 year mortgage but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.000
rate is 2% and you pay way more because&nbsp;
it's a much longer term mortgage okay&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
people think oh well i'll take the short term&nbsp;
mortgage on the higher interest rate because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.160
i'll pay less interest. that is exactly completely&nbsp;
the wrong thing to do but it looks good because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.040
they'll show you a form and it'll say well this&nbsp;
is the amount of interest you found this mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.320
and that's the interest you'll pay on that mortgage&nbsp;
but the reason you're paying more interest on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.600
longer term mortgage because you're borrowing&nbsp;
money for a much much longer period of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.560
and that gives you money for a long period of time&nbsp;
and then you can do what you want with that money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.720
you can invest the money or you could you could&nbsp;
buy more property basically it's valuable to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.920
that money the most important thing is to get the&nbsp;
lowest interest rate because then that means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.800
your monthly interest payment will be lower&nbsp;
um that's the number one most important thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640
and also if we talk about financial advice for&nbsp;
ordinary people the very first thing you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.840
do if at all possible is go check your mortgage&nbsp;
because sometimes people take two year fixed rates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.880
the rate run out, the rate runs out and it goes to&nbsp;
a much higher rate and it'll be super&nbsp;expensive

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.480
refinance get the lowest rate you can&nbsp;, the most 
important thing is pick the lowest&nbsp;interest rate

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.880
it's not complicated okay so then&nbsp;we talk 
about how long should the mortgage term&nbsp;be?&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.960
There's 2 types of term - there's the term&nbsp;of the
fixed rate - if you take a 2 or 5 year fixed rate

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.440
and then there's the term of the&nbsp;overall
mortgage which is 25, 35 years or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.160
um in terms of the rates um it's generally 
best to pick whatever is the lowest rate

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.680
If a 5 year fix is only slightly higher than a&nbsp;
2 year fix it might be worth it just to lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.720
in security for longer period of time um really&nbsp;
depends on what's happening at the time but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.640
don't pay too much to have a longer fix but in&nbsp;
terms of the overall term of the mortgage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.800
it's actually better to have a longer&nbsp;
term of mortgage and some people don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.680
understand this intuitively because they see
well i'll pay more interest if i borrow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.640
money for longer period of time but if you 
take a 35 year mortgage all that means is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.520
you'll have a lower monthly repayment 
but remember you always have the&nbsp;option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.920
of paying more every year if you want to
and if you are able to save more money

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.760
that's&nbsp;a very sensible thing to do
is to pay your mortgage down

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.280
um but if you take a 25-year mortgage with higher&nbsp;
monthly payments you can't make those payments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.320
lower if you want whereas if you have a 35-year&nbsp;
mortgage with low payments you can make those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.160
payments higher if you want. So effectively you're&nbsp;
just choosing the maximum term that you're allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.200
so if you take a 35 year mortgage nobody's&nbsp;
stopping you from paying off in 15 years but if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040
you take a 15 year mortgage you try and pay off
in 35 years you're going to be in trouble basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.880
so you should always take the longest possible&nbsp;
term and you should basically consider yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.560
as an individual and as a family - do we want to&nbsp;
pay that mortgage off early? if you have the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.200
or do you want to invest in other investment you&nbsp;
know you might want to buy a house for your kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.400
you might want to buy build up&nbsp;
a stock and share portfolio so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.600
if you borrow the money for longer then you can&nbsp;
still pay it off more quickly if you want but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.680
also have that money for a long period of time 
you&nbsp;can use it to create passive investments 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.600
you can buy more property for your kids 
you can buy stocks&nbsp;&amp; stocks 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.160
so always take the longer&nbsp;mortgage

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.440
and then you have the choice of&nbsp;
paying off whenever you want within that time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.360
don't take a shorter mortgage because if you need&nbsp;
more time it'll become more difficult to get it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.880
housing could be so much more affordable wages&nbsp;
could be so much higher and we could have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.200
many more options in how we live our lives some&nbsp;
of them put a lot of money into paying economists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.840
and think tanks to tell you that inequality&nbsp;is
is important for the economy that is not true
