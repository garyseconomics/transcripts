00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.000
I think the economic analysis on the news&nbsp;
most of the time is horrendously bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.280
you might as well not listen to it really&nbsp;
you're better off trying to build your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.000
connections with friends, family, workmates to build&nbsp;
an understanding of what's happening in their lives

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.200
I think you need to have an understanding&nbsp;
of the country that we live in which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.600
that there are a lot of very poor people there&nbsp;
are a lot of very poor people in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.800
and its growing but there is also a big chunk&nbsp;
of people in the middle who own property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.280
own some wealth and are feeling insecure 
because&nbsp;they're losing, this is the world that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.760
we live in right, we have a big chunk, a big growing&nbsp;
chunk of poor and then we have a decent chunk of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.080
what do they call them? The Precariat, you know&nbsp;
people who own property but they can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.640
the truth is you know we just done the video&nbsp;
just now the 'dying middle class', "the death of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.120
the middle class" so you have this middle class, it's&nbsp;
shrinking, generation after generation it's shrinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.560
so these guys are feeling ****in insecure because 
they&nbsp;are insecure, right they are insecure, but if &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.760
the political environment we create is: the poor&nbsp;
against the integral middle class we're never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.200
gonna ****in win like that are we you need to&nbsp;
create this alliance of the poor and the integral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.880
middle class against the very rich who are taking&nbsp;
everything, that's what you need to create and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.200
yeah if if we allow there to be division where&nbsp;
the very poor are like its the middle class ****s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.640
not protecting us, you know I know, it's.. I've&nbsp;
been poor and I've been part of this property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.600
owning middle class you know, I've been in both&nbsp;of 
these spaces you know &amp; most people who are poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.520
even.. most people who are poor aspire to be in that&nbsp;
property owning middle class because it's ****in ****&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.160
being poor, you know what I mean, I ****in been 
it,&nbsp;there's no ****in fun, but if you turn around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.640
to them and say what we're going to do is&nbsp;we're 
going to attack the property owning middle class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.160
that's what they want to be, that you&nbsp;know,
so I think you need to be able to build..&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.920
and I think we can, I think we can do it, I think&nbsp;we 
can do it and I think, I think that some sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.000
some people on the political left, sometimes&nbsp;
encourage that infighting, but we can't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.160
infighting, we need to build unity, we need to build&nbsp;
unity and we need to understand that that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.800
creating alliances between people in different&nbsp;
financial positions, you know what I mean some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.200
people who are very poor &amp; some people who own&nbsp;
assets but you know otherwise how did we win?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.320
you know if you, if you create that fight at the 
same&nbsp;time the Super Rich are taking everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040
it's a little bit like you're playing chess and the 
other&nbsp;side is just taking your pieces one at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.000
you know those are the guys who are taking&nbsp;the 
****ing pieces, that is where the wealth is going

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.520
if you don't attack the people&nbsp;who 
are taking the things that you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.920
you know, you're going to lose right, you&nbsp;
need to fight power where it is, you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.080
did you read um 1984? 1984 by George 
Orwell&nbsp;so there's a bit of 1984 called the..&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.040
is it three minutes hate? three minutes 
hate&nbsp;i think and i think the point of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.680
is like they show them some videos to&nbsp;
make them angry, but a big point of it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.120
when you get people angry, it's actually&nbsp;
quite easy to shift the target of their anger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.000
you get people angry and you shift the target&nbsp;
of their anger because people don't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720
understand how the system works, but we don't&nbsp;
really, people know they're getting ****ed&nbsp;over&nbsp;

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.400
and they are getting ****ed over right but&nbsp;people 
don't understand exactly how or exactly why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.560
because it is confusing right and a big part&nbsp;
of this channel is to just make it clear, listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.240
we know that your family is struggling, we know&nbsp;
that your family is getting worse off, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.800
reason is because you as a group are losing out to&nbsp;
this Super Rich who are taking more &amp; more &amp; more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.160
and you need to defend yourself from that&nbsp;
group and we need to unite to defend ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.160
from that group we're trying to make clarity, look&nbsp;
we understand your problem, this is the problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.360
this is how you fix it, you need to deal with this&nbsp;
group of people but people don't understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720
right they're angry and they're scared and I&nbsp;
think when you make people angry and scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360
it's so easy to throw them a group and be like&nbsp;
'these are the guys to be angry at' especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360
when people don't actually understand what's&nbsp;
happening. people want to focus. people don't like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.480
to feel like 'oh my God, I'm stressed, I'm anxious,&nbsp;
I don't know the problem' and that's that's why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.440
you see the media throws 'ooh it's immigrants,&nbsp;
it's immigrants' you know what I mean or it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.240
just stop oil protesters those ****heads them you&nbsp;
know what I mean they're the guys doing it or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.520
it's ****in cyclists you know like people are angry&nbsp;
people are scared but people don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.720
what's happening so the media just throws in&nbsp;
people to hate, people to hate so the hatred is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.680
there, the hatred is there but we're just throwing&nbsp;
it amongst each other and we're hating each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.120
and we're not actually taking action against the&nbsp;
group that is taking all of our stuff and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.240
the idea the media throws you about&nbsp;them is 
'oh we need them, if they leave we're ****ed,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.120
we need them, they protect us' because they're the 
guys who own the ****in media know what i mean

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.400
so the anger&nbsp;is there, the hatred is there,
but you know there's....

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.000
its as classic as divide and rule isn't it? there's&nbsp;
a billionaire owned media that just want us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.440
to hate each other and confuse us about the&nbsp;
economic picture, so our job is to say no listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.200
you and we need to put aside our&nbsp;differences 
to prevent this disaster&nbsp;from&nbsp;happening

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.040
which is the super rich&nbsp;taking our stuff 
and if we do that&nbsp;then we can have a 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.280
much better quality&nbsp;of life, that's the 
message we need to send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.360
it's funny yeah because I actually watched the&nbsp;
super mainstream media and the reason I do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.880
that is because I want to know what people are&nbsp;
being told because I I want to be able to sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.080
I want to understand what people are being told&nbsp;
so I can sort of set them straight you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.080
I mean, like you're getting this message but&nbsp;
the reality is this so I watched like super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.000
I watch BBC News and I watch Sky News you&nbsp;
know sometimes I think it's not great um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.520
but I mean really really I watch the markets&nbsp;
that's what I do I'm going to, people are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.880
to watch this and be like I need to become a&nbsp;
trader! I have a trading account and I trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.600
and I look every day what's moving, I talk to&nbsp;
traders you know obviously I was a full-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.520
trader for a long time and I'm still in touch&nbsp;
with some traders that I used to work with um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.760
and I say you know this is moving this way, what do&nbsp;
you think of it, that's moving that way, it's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.600
I'm generally or if there's any big movements&nbsp;
in markets I'm aware that they've happened and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.960
yeah i look at what the traders think, what the&nbsp;
markets think, that's not to say that I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.000
the traders &amp; the markets are always right but&nbsp;
I think these guys are the best informed people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.320
um so I want to know what they think and then I&nbsp;
I do my own analysis of it. I think watch... 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.000
oh first of all if this if there's stuff that you really&nbsp;
want to know put it in the comments because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.320
do go through them and like if a lot of people are&nbsp;
asking for the same thing then we will cover it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.120
right so if there's a specific thing that you're&nbsp;
worried about, you don't understand, go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.520
um obviously um watch this channel 
i&nbsp;think this is like, the whole idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.120
this channel is to make ordinary people&nbsp;
better informed about what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:57.280
um but I think ordinary people, watch the news&nbsp;
but just, just have a sceptical eye, don't be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.200
'everything's a lie' but don't be like 'everything's&nbsp;
true' just like I think the truth of the media is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.000
different media organizations have their own&nbsp;
biases right even something like the BBC has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.240
a bias everything has a bias this channel&nbsp;
has a bias this channel is obviously about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.280
saying inequality is a problem and we need&nbsp;
to tax the rich you know what I mean and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.200
you should watch everything with an&nbsp;
understanding of what the bias is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.200
um if you find the media stressing you out, 
turn&nbsp;it off, because I think a lot I think a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.840
what the media does is just stress people&nbsp;out, 
stresses people out, it makes people feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.320
helpless, it makes people feel like 'oh my God the&nbsp;
situation is helpless, there's nothing we can do'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.120
don't get stressed I would say realistically&nbsp;
so when I was a trader at Citibank there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.600
one point where I lost a lot of money and I&nbsp;
started to bring my textbooks in to try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.000
understand what's happening and I worked 
with&nbsp;this one trader who was um, proper

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
working class background, he never went 
to university, he was a great trader

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.240
a really great trader and he just&nbsp;slapped the 
textbooks out of my book, out of my hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.680
and was like listen if you want.. he was like..&nbsp;
he said how old are you and I was like, I dunno&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.040
22 or 23 and he was like listen you're not a&nbsp;kid 
anymore if you want to understand the economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.040
go and look at what's happening, walk down the&nbsp;
High Street, look at what shops are closing down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.920
look at like what's being advertised on the tube,&nbsp;
look at is there more homeless people are less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.040
homeless people, talk to your mum ask her about&nbsp;
her financial situation, talk to your friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.600
and find out what's happening with their financial&nbsp;
situation, your friends and your friends family so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.640
I think the economic analysis on the news most of&nbsp;
the time is horrendously bad, you might as well not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:40.520
listen to it really, you're better off trying&nbsp;to build 
your connections with friends, family,&nbsp;workmates&nbsp;

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.680
to build understanding what's happening&nbsp;
in in their lives, I honestly think that that of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.680
course be aware that you know, things might be&nbsp;
different in other parts of the country or other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.680
communities you know you're not going to know 
that&nbsp;the rich are getting much richer if you do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.400
but you build those connections that gives&nbsp;you 
a better understanding of what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.120
um and then yeah you know are there any&nbsp;
sort of other media outlets we recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:12.400
um obviously Novara have been very helpful,&nbsp;
supported us a lot um but I think you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.120
just.. what.. there's a lot of misinformation on&nbsp;
the internet and you know we try and do our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:22.960
best to do that, um to to do that? to fix that!&nbsp;
we try to do our best to put that right um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:31.120
but yeah I think try not to freak out because I&nbsp;
think a lot of the news can do that um turn it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.920
if it's stressing you out, if you have specific&nbsp;
things you want to know about put them in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.120
comments we can't promise we'll do them but if we&nbsp;
get the same thing asked a lot we will cover it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.640
um but yeah I think you're better off like working&nbsp;
on your your friends, your family, stay with them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.400
talk to them, be open with your friends and your&nbsp;
family about what's happening and then that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.840
give you at least a realistic understanding of&nbsp;
what's happening around you, yeah and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.000
find that the news you're consuming is making 
you&nbsp;really angry just stop and think 'do these &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
guys have some motivation to make me angry 
at&nbsp;those people?' you know what I mean? 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.520
does it benefit them because I think there's a 
lot,&nbsp;you know you know, because people could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.040
turn around and criticise us and say well you're&nbsp;
trying to make us angry with the rich, angry at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.920
billionaires, to be honest I'm not even trying to&nbsp;
make people angry at the rich, angry at billionaires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.440
what I want is so people don't understand that&nbsp;
this economy is driving off of a ****ing cliff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.600
that's what people I want people to understand&nbsp;
that's all you know it's not about being angry&nbsp;at&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.960
anyone I don't want to point a finger at&nbsp;George 
Osborne or Rishi Sunak you know I never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.000
met these guys they might be nice guys for all&nbsp;
I know it'd be a surprise but they might be nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.680
guys right this is not about being angry right&nbsp;
I am somebody who made millions of pounds a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.320
and continues to make a ton of money by betting&nbsp;
that the economy is driving off of a cliff and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.560
that is my simple message we need to stop that from&nbsp;
happening we need to stop that from happening and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.600
the only way to stop that from happening is&nbsp;
significantly increased taxation of the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.720
it's as simple as that it's not about being&nbsp;
angry it's not about being angry if you&nbsp;and&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.120
me and our mates are in a car and one of&nbsp;our 
mates is driving the car of the edge of a cliff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.760
you ain't going to help no one by being angry you&nbsp;
can take that wheel and you stop it from going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.880
off the cliff it's as simple as that like we need&nbsp;
there is a disaster happening when you look at how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.960
significantly living standards have fallen in the&nbsp;
last three years it's not going to keep happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.200
at that speed but I guarantee you, I guarantee you&nbsp;
in five years in 10 years there'll be more poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.240
significantly more poverty but we can prevent that&nbsp;
we can prevent that if we fix our taxation systems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.320
if we fix our type and if we don't then we won't&nbsp;
prevent it and you'll have that poverty and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.200
will have this broad poverty across most of the&nbsp;
population that you see in countries like India&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.600
that you see in countries like Brazil that&nbsp;you're 
seeing in countries like Colombia you&nbsp;know&nbsp;

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.800
that you see in countries like Russia this&nbsp;
is what capitalist economies usually look like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.840
and the reason that we don't have that kind&nbsp;
of poverty here in Western Europe and in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.840
States is because we have protected our wealth&nbsp;
distribution and we've prevented it from becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.040
extremely unequal but that is what capitalist&nbsp;
economies become if you don't stop that and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:13.000
not stopping that and that is where we will all go&nbsp;
so it's I'm not trying to tell anybody say anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.240
what I'm saying is in fact what I'm saying is the&nbsp;
opposite we need to get together to prevent this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.720
disaster and I would encourage even the rich and&nbsp;
even the I'm a rich person myself right I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.960
encourage the rich and the very rich to support&nbsp;
this message because it's in nobody's interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:34.240
to massively destabilise society like what we&nbsp;
are doing, you know last time this happened last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.960
time we saw this massive increase in inequality&nbsp;
massive collapse in living standards, what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.880
two ****in world wars a ****in Holocaust is&nbsp;
what happened right that is what can happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.040
if you allow your society to collapse it's not in&nbsp;
anybody's interests it's not in anybody's interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.040
so this is not about hating people this is about&nbsp;
bringing people together to prevent a disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.960
and I know I've just said people shouldn't&nbsp;
panic and then I've said we're gonna like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.560
go into this sort of space but, 
it's&nbsp;fixable, it's fixable, it's fixable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.040
if we bring people together, 
bring people together, its..&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.080
it's doable because you know even if you even if&nbsp;
you were to accept that the richest 10% or even the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.040
richest 20% will always oppose it right and some&nbsp;
of them you know I mean I'm in the richest 20%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.720
and I'm not opposing it right? some of these rich&nbsp;
people will support it but even if you assume 20%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.680
of people oppose it that leaves 80%, 80% of people 
is&nbsp;definitely not in their interest to allow this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.440
to continue definitely definitely so we need to&nbsp;
find a ways to reach those people and say listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.600
this is what's going to happen we don't change 
anything&nbsp;&amp; it's you know and the power that we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.680
and the power that we always have is that 
we're&nbsp;right, so people can come back in 5 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.560
and 10 years and watch this video and be like&nbsp;
**** me he was right just like people now can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.040
go back and watch our videos at the beginning of&nbsp;
Covid and say it was right, this is the power that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.520
we have on this channel is that the predictions&nbsp;
are correct because the understanding is correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.400
because it will happen it will happen because&nbsp;
it's inevitable we we can see it in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.960
our eyes the loss of the wealth of the middle&nbsp;
class and the growth in poverty we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.440
nothing could be more obvious so these things&nbsp;
will happen and we need to keep saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.440
but what I need to think about, you need to think 
about&nbsp;&amp; the viewers need to think about is how do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.920
we bring people on board, how do you bring people&nbsp;
on board, how do we fight against narratives that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:24.680
drive us to hate one another? can we, can we be&nbsp;
big enough as people to reach out across the lines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.480
that we're being told to divide ourselves&nbsp;against 
property owners, non-property owners, people from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.680
the North, people from London, you see they're&nbsp;
trying to drive ethnic division, you see they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.600
trying to drive gender division, you see they're&nbsp;
trying to drive age division, you know what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.000
we can't accept that we have to be willing to look&nbsp;
to people who are different from ourselves and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.200
listen we have a common interest here we have to&nbsp;
be able to do that we have to be able to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.240
that is the only way that we will prevent a disaster&nbsp;
um but yeah it comes from a place of positivity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.840
right not fear, of ability to connect to other&nbsp;
people and and just the message is simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:06.040
listen if we don't do anything here it's disaster for&nbsp;
80-90% of people you know you know really unequal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.680
economies do not have 10% of people living a good&nbsp;
standard of living, they don't and that's where we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.600
going to go you know so we can all kick ourselves 
in&nbsp;the nuts to try and be in the top 5% or&nbsp;we can&nbsp;

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.800
we can keep a good standard living for most&nbsp;
people and its in everybody's interest to lead there
