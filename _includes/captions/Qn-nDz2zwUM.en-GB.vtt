00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.040
Okay, welcome back to Gary's Economics&nbsp;
today we are going to talk about Money

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.960
okay I've wanted to do this video about money for&nbsp;
a while now and we'll probably do some more videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.720
about money because it's a big subject area but&nbsp;
the main reason that I came through this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.440
today is the other day I read an article which was&nbsp;
talking about why are rents up so much in London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.240
and other big cities and this was an article in the&nbsp;
Financial Times uh there's a link to it on my Twitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.880
if you want to look at it and basically in this&nbsp;
article it spoke entirely about issues regarding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.000
the supply and demand for apartments and that&nbsp;
seems like it makes total sense right you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.120
to understand why apartment rents have gone up so&nbsp;
you look at the supply and demand for apartments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.200
but I want to give you a thought experiment to&nbsp;
help you maybe understand why to me I think this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.480
is strange now imagine the price of apples went&nbsp;
up relative to oranges so an apple used to cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.680
the same as an orange and now an Apple costs twice as&nbsp;
much as an Orange and at the same time there's been a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.960
massive massive increase in the supply of oranges&nbsp;
there's been like a massive bumper orange harvest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.000
and then now an apple costs two times an orange as&nbsp;
opposed to one you would say well this is probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.080
because we've got so many oranges now and if at&nbsp;
the same time everything the price was going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.400
in terms of oranges you would say well this makes&nbsp;
sense because we've got so many more oranges now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.200
right this would be totally sensible now imagine&nbsp;
we replace that example we take our oranges and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.640
replace it with money imagine suddenly the price&nbsp;
of an apple in terms of money doubled and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.680
before that there'd been suddenly loads and loads&nbsp;
more money everybody had more money would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.160
say this is because everybody's got more money or&nbsp;
would you look specifically at something that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.280
to do with apples now imagine at the same time the&nbsp;
price of everything has gone up relative to money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200
would you say this is probably because of the&nbsp;
increase in the amount of money everyone has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.160
or would you say well let's look at every specific&nbsp;
thing and try and find out what's going on in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.040
specific thing now I think it would be sensible&nbsp;
if there was suddenly a massive increase in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.840
average amount of cash holdings in a country&nbsp;
and then the prices of everything went up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
suddenly say this is probably because&nbsp;
such a huge amount of money was given up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.200
but this has happened in the last 3 years&nbsp;
the government's given out £600 billion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.120
which is £13,000 per person so we know that&nbsp;at
least some people must have hugely more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.840
and yet the Financial Times runs a&nbsp;story
saying why have London rents&nbsp;gone up&nbsp;

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.400
and it doesn't mention even once that&nbsp;an
enormous amount of money has been given up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.640
to me I think this is so interesting and it&nbsp;
shows that there's kind of a blind spot in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.360
minds of a lot of people and a lot of economists&nbsp;
regarding the fact that you know money is a thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.640
and the value of money can go up and down and&nbsp;
if we suddenly give out a huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.240
then the value of money will go down which&nbsp;
would mean the price of everything goes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.960
um and you know people who watch this channel&nbsp;
regularly will know I was a money trader for a&nbsp;long&nbsp;

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.960
time and I was a very successful money trader&nbsp;
I was a money trader full-time for six years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.040
um and when you're a money trader all you&nbsp;
do all day is you look at the different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.320
kinds of money you know there's lots&nbsp;
of different kinds of money in the&nbsp;world&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320
British Pounds (£), US Dollars ($), Australian&nbsp;Dollars
($), Euros (€) and you try and work out which&nbsp;monies&nbsp;

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.480
are going to become more valuable and which&nbsp;
monies are going to become less valuable so a &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.880
huge part of the job is understanding that the value&nbsp;
of money goes up and down and if you do that for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.600
a long time you start to realise that actually&nbsp;
money is one of the most volatile asset classes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.480
that exists, the value can fall very quickly and&nbsp;
one of the reasons for that is there are some big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.880
institutions like central banks: Bank of England,&nbsp;
European Central Bank, Federal Reserve in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.200
and governments that have the power to give out&nbsp;
huge amounts of money very quickly which mean &nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.400
that people suddenly have hugely more money than&nbsp;
they used to have and when that happens you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.720
would expect the value of money to fall but I&nbsp;
think people have a difficulty conceptualizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.720
an idea of the value of money falling because&nbsp;
people use money to value other things you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.320
how can the value of a pound fall? a pound is always
a pound but in reality if a huge amount of money is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.880
given out then the value of power can fall and&nbsp;
the way that we see that is that the price of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.360
everything at the same time will go up&nbsp;
which is exactly what's happening now um

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.680
what has happened in the last few years is&nbsp;during
Covid the huge amount of money was given out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.800
the price of everything went up and rather than&nbsp;
say this is probably because of a fall in the&nbsp;value &nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.040
of money people say well rents in London went&nbsp;
up because of issues in the London rental market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.480
and wages are going up because of specific&nbsp;issues
in the labour market and house prices going&nbsp;up&nbsp;

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.080
because of specific issues in the housing market&nbsp;
and food prices going up because specific issues

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.960
in the food market and every single individual&nbsp;
thing is blamed on specific issues in that area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.080
and this is super interesting to me and you&nbsp;
know I'm not denying that there are areas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.520
in which there are supply problems so the most&nbsp;
obvious case is energy in Europe there's been a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.280
reduction in the energy coming from Russia into&nbsp;
Europe that's causing energy to go up but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.440
not just energy prices going up here you know&nbsp;
London rents are going through the roof and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.800
know this is not because of Vladimir Putin&nbsp;
or because of the war in Ukraine obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:49.040
um but for me the biggest problem that happens&nbsp;
when you are blind to ideas such as when money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.720
is given out it depresses the value of money is&nbsp;
it also leads you to be blind to other questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.880
like where did that money go and anyone who&nbsp;
watches this channel will know that I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.960
going on about this from the beginning of Covid&nbsp;
which is during Covid a huge amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.560
hundreds of billions of pounds, you know trillions&nbsp;
of US Dollars went from governments to the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.640
and the obvious consequence of that is that the&nbsp;
rich get richer ordinary people get poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.400
inequality increases and ordinary people find it&nbsp;
harder to live because you as an ordinary person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.800
are competing with the rich for limited resources&nbsp;
if they've got if they've got way more money they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.160
will get more and you will get less um and what that&nbsp;
has meant is because we don't look at money when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.440
these changes happen generally we haven't realised&nbsp;
and it's been very under reported in the media that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.040
in the last three years we've seen massive&nbsp;
massive increases in the wealth of the rich

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.240
and super rich in in pretty much every country&nbsp;
in the world it's been the fastest ever increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.440
in rich and super rich wealth and that's happened&nbsp;
in the UK it's happened in the US it's happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.240
in Europe and what that has meant has been that&nbsp;
when we've had this inflationary crisis after&nbsp;Covid&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.680
because the media has not generally reported&nbsp;what
an enormous increase in wealth there has been from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.800
the super rich it has meant we have not discussed&nbsp;
taxation of the super rich now the amount of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.120
that has gone from the government to the super&nbsp;
rich and the rich in this country has so far since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.200
Covid been £600 billion - if we were to tax&nbsp;
that back and just make the rich as rich as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.400
were before Covid we could give every single&nbsp;
adult in this country £13,000 and this&nbsp;crisis&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.920
would be over but because we don't talk&nbsp;about
this massive accumulation of cash by the&nbsp;rich&nbsp;

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.240
we don't talk about the fact that we could&nbsp;
get that money back and it also means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.080
the way we resolve the crisis now in Liz Truss'&nbsp;
energy bill recently announced we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.080
to give more cash to the rich which will likely&nbsp;
likely make this problem worse so yeah basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.520
I think it's really important that we understand&nbsp;
that when money is given out we question who it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.320
goes to we understand that if that money goes to&nbsp;
the rich it will make ordinary families poorer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.840
and the ordinary families will see that through&nbsp;
inflation which can also be seen as a reduction in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.280
the value of money which includes a reduction in&nbsp;
the value of your wages if we're not aware to that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.280
then we we allow ourselves to get into situations&nbsp;
where crises are managed in such a way that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.600
rich get much much much richer ordinary people get&nbsp;
much much poorer and nobody really notices it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.760
nobody talks about in the media so uh yeah money&nbsp;
is important the rich made a ton of it if we tax&nbsp;them&nbsp;

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.160
back we can make your life better and if we&nbsp;don't
unfortunately everybody's life is going to&nbsp;get worse&nbsp;

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.040
except for the super rich are richer than they've ever
been before. thank you very much like &amp; subscribe...
